I had to quit because I could not bear to think of working and having to listen to her tell me what to do. What do you think I should do? I lost everything because of her?\n",

It would be awful under any circumstances, but to find out that your boss — someone with whom there’s a certain vulnerability built into the relationship and who you generally assume isn’t actively working to destroy your personal life — was the person your partner was cheating with would add a whole additional level of betrayal to an already horrible situation.\nWhen you ask what you should do, I think you’re wondering if there’s something official you can do professionally — like filing a complaint? In theory you could try that (most companies do not want their managers sleeping with employees’ partners and it’s possible they’d be interested to know that’s why you quit) but there’s not really anything for you to gain by doing that (and the potential for a lot of drama on top of what’s already happened). I’d rather see you leave her in your past and focus on moving forward.\n",

Instead of rolling on the floor, clutching my head and sulking, I’d yodel positive hogwash like “Rejection makes me stronger” and “Rejection makes me smarter,” totter out, and try again. This is stupid. The key to turning around a brush-off (professional or amatory) is to figure out the ways one has made an ass of oneself, and then draw up a plan to avoid doing the same dumb things again.

    "prompt": "My ex and I have a 13-year-old daughter. We never married. After we broke up nine years ago (in part because of his drinking), he left the country. I never applied for sole custody. We agreed our daughter would live with me, and he never paid for anything. He moved back recently and has been having dinner with her once a week. She’s getting used to having him in her life. The issue: Twice, he has turned up drunk. Most recently, he arrived very late — without responding to her many texts — and was sick in front of her. When I asked him to leave, we argued, and that upset my daughter a lot. (He denies he has a drinking problem; often, he denies he’s been drinking at all.) How can I help my daughter navigate this relationship?\n",
    "human": "I share your concern for your daughter. It is really important that she not ride in a car with a driver who has been drinking, or be left alone with someone who is too impaired to care for her. Start drumming that into her head now! And it is unfair to ask her — at 13 — to police adult behavior. (No “call me if he seems odd.”) She is too young for that, and it may be hard for her to rat out her father. Tell your ex that his visits must take place in your home.\nNow, in many states, when an unmarried woman gives birth, she automatically becomes the sole guardian of the child until a court rules otherwise. Confirm the laws in your state. Perhaps no further action is required of you, but if it is, petition to become your daughter’s sole legal guardian now to ensure the primacy of your decisions.\nThe hardest part of this story may be your ex’s dishonesty about his drinking. It makes him an unreliable parent — which may be upsetting for your daughter and prevents you from trusting him. Encourage her to talk about this or, better yet, find her a teen chapter of Al-Anon in your area. If she is going to have a problem drinker in her life, give her the tools to handle it.\n",

    "prompt": "When my husband and I married, years ago, we created a blended family of children from our prior marriages. Together, we decided that travel was important to us, and we prioritized it: We stayed in our small house and drove used cars to pay for annual family trips. Now, the children are grown, but we want to continue taking them on vacations. So far, we have included our son’s longtime partner. Our other two children are single, but we have a dilemma with our daughter’s best friend and roommate. Our daughter asked if she could bring her on a recent theater outing. We weren’t enthusiastic about spending $150 on a seventh ticket, but her friend had to work, so it became a nonissue. But what if this comes up on our next family vacation to Ireland? Do we have to pay for her? Are platonic partners on the same level as romantic ones?\n",
    "human": "I admire the care that you and your husband took to prioritize family experiences over possessions. I bet it wasn’t easy; kids have a way of clamoring for stuff. But back then, you and your husband were the only adults. Now, there are five grown-ups. So it doesn’t really matter how I rank these different relationships: You should talk to your children about this.\nNow, if you and your husband have strong feelings here, game over! It’s your money. But to me, your question suggests a desire to treat your children equally and to be respectful of relationships that are important to them. I can imagine someone prizing a best friend and roommate as highly as a romantic partner; I can also imagine someone who wouldn’t. So ask your daughter how she feels. There are many ways to make a family; sex and romance are not required.\nGoing forward, gather the children and reiterate your commitment to family travel. Share your budget, and the total costs for immediate family members. Depending on the surplus, you can cover some (or all) of the travel costs of partners and chosen family members — or you can throw those costs back to the children involved. Try to be openhearted, though. It will serve you better to be inclusive than to decide unilaterally which of your children’s relationships matter more.\nGPT4 answer (239)\nCreating a blended family comes with its unique set of challenges, including defining the boundaries of inclusivity for extended family and friends, especially during cherished family trips. This is a nuanced situation and does not have a one-size-fits-all answer. However, it ultimately comes down to your personal discretion and the values that you and your husband hold dear.\nIt's important to first acknowledge that platonic relationships can hold just as much weight as romantic ones, especially in our current era where the definition of family has greatly evolved. Therefore, your daughter's close friend could potentially be seen as part of your extended family.\nHowever, when it comes to financing trips for family members or their significant others, it's about what you can feasibly afford without compromising your own financial security. If you feel that the cost is too high, it may be wise to have a discussion with your daughter about sharing the costs or asking her friend to contribute.\nAlso, it's critical to maintain fairness across all your children. If your daughter’s friend is invited, you might need to extend a similar offer to the partners or close friends of your other children, which could significantly increase the costs of these trips.\nLastly, it's important to communicate. Discuss this issue openly with your family, as their input may provide useful insights and potential solutions. Your ultimate goal is to maintain family harmony while still upholding your travel traditions.\n",

    "prompt": "My roommate and I have lived together for some years. We are not close but get along well. He mainly keeps to himself, sleeping most of the day and staying up at night. He is very well off and enjoys many luxuries but has long struggled with depression.\nA few years ago, he decided to get a dog, for company and emotional support. He has held on to a high-paying job, and so I thought he would do a good job taking care of the dog. But he never trained her: She isn’t housebroken, she often bit us while young and she cannot be left unsupervised. Worse, I believe he is neglecting the dog, out of an inability or lack of desire to change his lifestyle. He takes her out only about twice a day, the first time when he wakes up, usually between noon and 2 p.m. He never takes the dog for walks, only out to relieve herself, which takes about five to 10 minutes. (This breed of dog requires an hour of exercise per day, I’ve read.) He also keeps the dog in his bedroom with him most of the day, evidently because she is not housebroken enough to roam the apartment. When I’ve taken care of the dog while he is on vacation, I’ve put her on a more normal schedule of walks and regular pee breaks. During those periods, she has been very well behaved and able to roam the place.\nI have never confronted my roommate about this. But I’ve made many suggestions, including that he get a dog walker or dog day care (which he could easily afford); I’ve commented on how her behavior changes, and how she enjoys her walks, when I take care of her. I worry that confronting him will ruin our relationship, but I am saddened every day about the dog’s treatment.\n",
    "human": "Because your roommate doesn’t want to, or isn’t able to, change a lifestyle he has grown accustomed to, he is allowing this dog to languish. Could the same be said of you?\nHaving a pet carries responsibilities, and your roommate isn’t discharging them. The trouble is that pets aren’t in a position to insist on getting what they’re owed; someone may have to do it for them. It’s hard, I know, to challenge someone you live with, and harder still when the person is dealing with a serious disability. Yet it isn’t respectful to treat people as if they can’t respond to reasonable suggestions. It’s past time to raise the issue more directly, pointing out courteously but firmly that his dog isn’t getting what she needs to thrive. And don’t let it drop.\nRight now, you’ve chosen to maintain a peaceable relationship with your roommate at the expense of a sentient creature capable of experiencing neglect and distress. That may be convenient, but in this case there’s no excuse for letting sleeping dogs lie. She is a member of your household; her well-being matters, and if you don’t speak up for her interests, who will?\n",

    "prompt": "After a childhood spent shuttling between divorced parents, my relationship with my father (with whom I never lived full time) became rote and dreaded as I matured into adulthood. Not only did I recognize he was a deeply unhappy person with addiction issues which occasionally placed me in danger, I was always bothered by his racist, misogynistic and homophobic jokes. These and other behaviors became intolerable to me as I entered my 20s, and I distanced myself until firmly cutting off all contact about five years ago.\nI do not miss him and have never regretted that choice. Moreover, and maybe this marks me as a cold individual, I no longer have contact with his side of the family — we were never close and shared no warmth. My father’s sibling, however, died recently, and while I have no concerns that I was unable to say goodbye to them, I have found myself wondering what I will do and feel when my elderly father passes. I don’t even know who would arrange his funeral, etc. Ethically speaking, what do I owe to a parent whom I have no contact with, do not respect and never want to see again?\n",
    "human": "We have duties to others that derive from the nature of our relationship with them. To have a relationship with someone that you value in itself — not for whatever benefits it may bring — is, as my colleague Samuel Scheffler has proposed, to “see oneself as having special responsibilities” to that person. Yet this plainly isn’t a relationship you value in any way. Do you then have any obligations to this man?\nNow, gratitude can oblige us to do things for people we dislike. And you might think you owe this man some gratitude because he helped raise you. You indicate, though, that his parenting was subpar. Some people hold that the bare fact that someone was your biological parent means you owe them something. You do, after all, owe them your existence. But it’s much clearer that parents have responsibilities to the children they brought into the world than it is that children have automatic responsibilities to their parents. And whatever duties we, as children, have to our parents seem limited when they have failed in their duties to us.\n",

    "human": "Let’s stipulate that this fellow acquired these beliefs from growing up in a community rife with prejudices. Still, the fact that they came up suggests that they’re central to who he is, just as your recognition that they’re repugnant is central to who you are. “The perfect kind of friendship,” Aristotle said, “is that of good men who resemble one another in virtue.” That’s a wildly demanding ideal, and helping out this gent doesn’t require that you be friends — being friendly will suffice. But now that you’ve gained a sense of his worldview, it may be hard to sustain positive vibes.\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t do anything for him or with him. As you suggest, his odious convictions aren’t likely to be doing much harm; this isn’t an “Apt Pupil” scenario. Yet the assistance you’re providing him is a matter of generosity, not of duty. The situation would be more complicated if he were in serious need and had become reliant upon you, with nobody else to take up the slack. But that isn’t what your account suggests.

    "prompt": "We are a group of gay men who have known one another for several years. One of the men came out a few years ago. I’ll call him John. John recently came out again, now as transgender. John’s desire that we call him by a new name (correcting us when we refer to him as John), his need to talk with us incessantly about his transition, his change of clothing, the slow physical effects of the hormones he is taking — all of this has become a challenge for the rest of the group when we hang around together.\nBut our real concern is that we recently planned a gay tour in Mexico. The tour is very structured, with little personal time. Our group makes up a majority of the tour.\nJohn seems to think that we should all accept his new identity without reservation, with as much cheer and acceptance as he does for himself, not thinking or caring about how any of us might feel.\nAs superficial as this sounds, we no longer want our friend John to join us. There are reasons that gay men enjoy traveling together, and it’s not to hang around with a woman.\nStraight people imagine that gay men view trans men/women in the same inclusive bubble as other gay men. We are all, so the acronym implies, part of that big, progressive L.G.B.T.Q.+ umbrella. Not true. In general, gay men (for all of our performances of femininity) do not understand trans identity — we don’t commonly socialize together.\nThe bottom line is that John’s presence will spoil a much-anticipated and expensive vacation. Do we just put up or shut up? Should we talk? If so, about what?\n",
    "human": "You insist on referring to your friend by a male name, representing the one she used before she transitioned. That indicates a basic lack of empathy; “deadnaming” people like this — using the name they used before transitioning — undermines the process of inhabiting the gender identities they have affirmed, and is, in any case, disrespectful. If the other cis men in your group really think of her in this way and resist acknowledging her transition, then joining you on vacation is probably not a good idea for her.\nShe has obviously done a lot to explain her transition to you. (That’s one of the burdens uninformed cis people impose on trans people.) You should let her know that you’re still struggling with it. Once she recognizes that, she may well decide herself that she doesn’t want to go on a vacation with you.\nA word about your vacation plans: People get together on the basis of social identities all the time. There are plenty of travel clubs with names like Black Girls Travel Too, Latinas Who Travel and Shefari. Small social groups, morally and legally, don’t have to abide by the rules that govern public accommodations; in “The Little Rascals,” the He-Man Womun Haters Club (which Spanky restarts in a reaction to a boys-excluding party given by the McGillicuddy girls) would properly not attract the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And a female traveling companion would, I grant, be at odds with your objective of having an all-gay-men holiday. (I’ve also read that many gay clubs in Mexico have been distressingly hostile to trans women.)\nStill, your letter suggests that your problem is not so much the presence of a woman as the presence of a trans woman.

    "human": "One way that people successfully get loans repaid is to make it clear that no more money will be loaned until the previous owed amount is repaid.\nHowever, I think that your expectations of this hard-working single mom are unreasonable. She is barely keeping her head above water, and in helping her, you are also helping her children.\nFirst, you should feel good about your own generosity. Never lend more money than you can afford to lose, in case she can’t — or won’t — repay you.\nAnd yes, you should pick up the check when you two eat out. Doing this is giving your friend a treat — and a break. If you can’t afford to do this, then you shouldn’t eat out.\n",

    "prompt": "My little sister took over the family farm and has been running it (with my other sister) for two years. It is an incredible amount of work, and it keeps her busy from sunup to sundown. A year and a half ago, she had a son. I offered to watch him. I am a stay-at-home mom for my own boys, so no problem. We live with my parents, whose home sits right on the farm property. My sister offered money, but I said I was happy to watch him without payment.\nI agreed to this without first discussing it with my husband. But what had started out as a few days a week quickly turned into six days from breakfast to dinnertime. This started to cut into my own family time. My husband refused to help me on his days off because he had not agreed to it. We both became increasingly fatigued and bitter.\nWe went to marriage counseling. Our counselor said it was unfair that I had not discussed it with my husband from the beginning and that I should cut back on the babysitting commitment. I did, and we both felt better.\nI had a baby in February, and I told my sister I would like a “maternity leave.” But I told her if she wanted to move into the empty lot next to us, I would be willing to watch her child during my baby’s infancy. When I told my husband, he was distraught. He said that I did this without his consent again and that he would have said no if I had asked him first.\nI understand why he is upset. I should have communicated before offering. But I also wonder why I need his permission to do something that I enjoy doing, that helps out a family member and that blesses my own children. My husband never has to watch this child at all. Can he tell me what I can and can’t do in this regard? It seems a bit controlling to me. Or am I missing something?\n",
    "human": "I can’t figure out why you took your counselor’s good advice, things got better for both you and your husband, then you proceeded to repeat the behavior you had agreed to change. Your husband is not telling you what to do. He is telling you that you need to discuss decisions with effects on your family with him before committing. This is committing to a discussion, not an outcome.\nAnd, of course, he needs to do the same! You two have a new baby at home and now you are asking your sister to move closer to you, so you can commit further child care. Your family is living with your parents at their house.\nYour husband might feel overwhelmed and excluded because your immediate family is so enmeshed with your extended family. The way around this is for you two to act like full partners, discussing major work and family decisions with one another before committing, and to agree on reasonable boundaries.\n",
