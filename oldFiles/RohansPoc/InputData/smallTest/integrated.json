    "prompt": "Reddit, I'm a lazy asshole. I've been like that my entire high school career and it finally came to bite me back in the ass. I started off Grade 10 in Alberta, Canada. I've always had problems with waking up and going to school so around halfway through the year, the anxiety of going to a class that I've missed for days really built up and I just stopped going in the end. That's the story of how I failed Grade 10.\n\nNow, I move to Ontario for Grade 11, hoping that it would be better. I kind of cheated my way around the system and since I didn't have an official school transcript, they just had me do an equivalence test to determine where I should be in for what courses. I failed Math but passed English so I got placed into Grade 10 applied Math and Grade 11 University Eng. The deal was that when I passed my courses, they would give me the pre-requisite credits for the courses. That basically put me back on track for Grad, since I would only be behind a tiny bit.\n\nWhen I started school there, the councillor gave me the benefit of the doubt and enrolled me into Bio 20 as well, believing that I completed Science 10. Soon enough, I started having the same problems with waking up and I fell back into the same loop and failed another year. I dropped out the coming fall semester out of depression but re enrolled into a different school for Spring. This school was the first time I've pulled my head out of my ass and actually did really well. I finally had completed Math 10 and English 20 with high 80's, and it was one of the most gratifying feelings I've ever had. Riding on the high of my small success and the depression that my girlfriend had recently left me, I decided to move back to Alberta to graduate.\n\nEverything from this moment on started from last August when I did the move. My transcript didn't update properly like they promised and I never got the pre-requisite credits that I was supposed to get. Instead, I was left with only 3 credits out of 30 and those were for the courses I passed. Fell into a loop of depression again and it's only been recently in around February where I decided I need to go back to school again. All I want to do is graduate but at the pace I'm at now, I won't be doing that until I'm 21-22. I know how much I've fucked up in my life and I know that I'm ready for change. I just feel like I cant be stuck in the same place for so many years so my question to you is, **TL;DR** are there any alternatives to getting admitted into University other than a high school diploma? Thanks for reading.\n\n"

    "prompt": "Hey everyone, this is a throwaway account.\n\n\nI'm a 20 year old male college student. I had a girlfriend for a while back in high school that I had sex with a few times (6 or 7), and since coming to college I have slept with 2 girls (both were friends and it was a 1 time thing both times), but both times I was so excited that I came after only a minute or two. I also masterbate just about every night, and unless I'm trying to make myself last longer by taking breaks or something then I usually cum in about a minute (sorry if that was too graphic, but I'm in desperate need of some advice!). Making up excuses to cover my quickness in bed was tremendously embarrassing, and now I'm afraid to even talk/flirt with girls that I meet at parties, etc. or pursue a possible relationship because I know that if it comes down to it I will not be able to perform during sex, resulting in another episode of overwhelming embarrassment. I can talk and have a great time with girls who have boyfriends (no pressure and I'm not worried). \n\n\nI'm not having anxiety or anything, I just feel worthless and see no point in going to parties or typical college social situations because everyone is honestly just trying to get laid (my school is a lot of preppy bros, but not me haha). I'm getting pretty lonely because most of my friends are at parties having the time of their life flirting with girls while I'm hanging out in my room playing video games.\n\n\nThis fear of failure is now so intense that girls on campus debate if I am real because none of them have ever met me in person... I'm a fairly attractive guy (athletic, tall, blonde), and the few girls that are my friends (and a few guys) have tried to encourage me to be more social and flirt with girls. I obviously can't explain what's really going on, and I'm truly lost. I was at a party last week and a girl was all over me, playing withy hair and everything, but I just took myself out of the situation and left to go grab a drink with some friends instead. I also retreat/remove myself from the situation whenever a girl flirts with me in any way (and I'm bad at this, so I'm probably misinterpreting a lot of things and just driving myself away for no reason).\n\n\n**TL;DR** I'm in college and I have only had sex a few times and I cum really fast (1-2 minutes). Now I see no point in talking/flirting with girls because I know I will fail if it comes down to it. I am just driving girls away to protect myself from embarrassment, but I am so lonely.\n\n\nI also know that the more sex I have the longer I'll last, but I just can't bring myself to try again.\n\nPlease, Reddit, any advice at all would be appreciated more that you know. I'm about to be a senior in college, and I don't want to miss out on the best time of my life!!!"

    "prompt": "So, my best friend of two years (girl) and I are going through troubles. We have been super close friends and talk daily and quiet frankly given the chance i would date her but that's not the main point. The main point is her boy friend of (on and off) 7 months hates my guts even though we've never said a word to each other. he always \"makes fun of me\" (the kid is as dumb as a brick and i'm not just saying that) and tells her that she should stop talking to me and all that crap. And she recently got tired of it and fought with him. (they have fights like monthly its a bad relationship all my friends agree) So here i was talking to her as she cries about it and im trying to support her like a good friend and i told her break up and actually do it this time. and after about a day of telling her it's completely pointless to stay in the relationship she does the deed and things start to get slowly better that day. We spent the whole night talking and occasionally bring him up and she would say she regrets dating him and getting back with him all those time ect. I though it would only get better. Nope, next day at school (happend over the weekend like always, almost seems like he plans this stuff.) every time she saw him she got all up set and at the end of the day she was crying. After a hard relationship i would expect problems when ever she saw him. it's normally always like that. But her immediate reaction is to try and get back with him. He obviously takes her back cause he likes having control or some junk. The whole time she was trying to get back with him i was telling her not to and that she'll regret it. She called me a dick for it. i was ready to cry. we kind of made up after that kinda. and that day i got 2 jobs ( what are the chances) and after talking with friends that all agree i should leave her cause she's nuts i decided that i just wont talk with her as much. i told her that because of the 2 jobs i wouldnt be able to talk as much. the entire conversation she only responded with yep, sure, okay. Never a good sign. and i talked to her again later and again simple non exciting words are used and i feel like our dying friendship is about to fall on a chainsaw. Any thoughts would be accepted i just want opinions (Pardon me for any grammatical errors)"

    "prompt": "For many months now, the same presumed homeless man has been hiding things in my trash cans/recycling bins and around the property, rummaging through the bins (for no particular reason?!), and sleeping in my laundry room. He does these activities at any time of day or night, and these bins are literally right outside my window. Sometimes he is gone for weeks, but he always makes his way back. \n\nI have called the police on him countless times. They have offered no advice, and he has to physically be present for the full half an hour or whatever it takes for the police to get here. Then when the police arrive, they take him away (I have no idea where), and he is literally back the next day.\n\nI have talked to the homeless man probably about 10 times. He obviously does not give a shit about me or have any desire to respect me. My roommate and I have both warned him that if he continues hiding things that we will literally throw his things out. He continued hiding things, and one day I literally threw out a garbage bin's full of his things. He seemed to get the picture after this, but lo and behold, he is back, with his same old routine.\n\nI am at a loss as to what I can possibly do. I've thought about threatening him with violence, but I really don't want to do that to anyone, and I don't want to do anything illegal.\n\n[Edit]: In case this wasn't clear, I have used every possible humane and decent tactic, such as asking nicely to not make noise at night (this is my main problem), etc. The man is mentally ill, possibly a thief, and is illegally trespassing on private property. He does not listen to logic because he cannot listen to logic. Let me perhaps rephrase my question:\n\nHow do I get a mentally ill, disruptive, irreverent squatter off of my private property for good?"

We both handle stress in different ways, I like to talk about it she likes to shut it out. She is really busy writing and studying while I wanted nothing more to just talk to her. I ended up saying that she just didnt care about me and this and that, I should not have said it. This led to her saying she just cant do it anymore, she doesnt know if has time for a relationship or even wants one right now. Then she would not talk to me, I let her calm down texted her a few hours later she still said the same stuff but was willing to make a deal, we would take a break till end up next we when finals are over and we would go from there. Is she just stressed from finals but still has feeling? All throught this time I have my ex constantly talking to me and trying to get back together. I just dont know what to do anymore, Im so stressed from everything. tl;dr I messed up might have ruined something good. commentshare"

I went through special things in elementary school where they \"checked me out\" for any disorders(with the in school theorpist or whatever) but nothing came of it. Not sure if I just stopped going, was cleared, believe to just be lazy or they weren't sure. I've always had a strong interest in one thing where I would be almost addicted to it. Video games, programming, etc. But that \"high\", passion, desire, strong interest, whatever you want to call it, would phase out over time then I'd lose complete interest. While I had those \"sparks\" nearly everything would be irrelevant.\nLike when I was really into programming, I would go home and work on visual basic stuff but not do my homework(This was middle school). I would research really advance code, do things that most kids my age never could even understand and more. This pattern was true all the way through til now in college. Only problem is before I could get by with that but now it doesn't cut it. The grade schools I understood everything, because I had to go to class so by sitting there and \"soaking it in\" I understood it. I just never did homework or studied. I suprisingly did well on exams without must effort or studying because it made sense when feed it in the classroom.\nI've noticed a pattern where during the day I'm pretty low key but at night I'm very active. I call it \"my mind is on fire\". I'll analyze things, be very very very motivated to learn some topic, get ahead in school, do work etc. So I would either take advantage of that \"high\" and get stuff done or lay down try to sleep while my mind was still racing and basically lay there until nearly 5-6am. By that time I'm so exhausted that I would sleep through class.\n\nI've read some things and minor ADHD might be the cause but I \n   A: Don't want to be classified as a college kid looking for meds if I talk about it to a doctor.\n   B: Don't want to self diagnose when it really could be something simplier or more complex.\n\nWhat should I do reddit? My grades are awful, I feel like I'm giving my parents excuses when it really is the truth.\n\nI mentioned it to my parents but I feel they don't want to believe their son has a disorder/disability. I was in denial before to. I hate asking for help, as seen from previous examples, I will fail before I ask for help. It's a good thing but also not good. \n\nSo I'm breaking from my shell and asking for help/advice.\n\n-Z"

From inside my apartment anywhere from 4:30pm to 10pm when I'm home from work he can be heard screaming his ass off for any number of things.

    "prompt": "I don't even know where to begin.  This is obviously a throwaway, I know reddiquette but please bare with me as english composition was never my best subject.  Backstory: I have know my roommate in question since middle school.  He has always like to party but I feel that this takes the absolute cake.  It is starting to affect my life and I am trying to generate a few ideas to try and confront the issue but it is a delicate situation. On with the story!\n\nThis all starts back on Back on Wednesday, April 24th around 10pm. My roommate, we will call DA for dumbass, just finished his class for the semester and decided to party. No big deal. I go to work the next morning, finish my day and then head home.  I find out DA is still drinking, a little crazy but fine. I have known DA likes to party pretty hard but, it really has never been that big of an issue, till now.....\n\nOn Thursday DA continues the drink-a-thon, hasn't stopped yet.  After I get home from work DA decides that MDMA is the drug of choice for the night.  DA is being all \"lovey\" with everything and everyone because of the drugs.  Thursday night is fairly uneventful.  I only wish that was the trend.\n\nOn Friday I wake up go to work and come home. I find out DA has bough Xannax, just cause.  He does Xannax all day Friday and Saturday(20 in total).  Sunday morning I am wake to the fact that DA is cold so he cranked the heat up to 85 then went into my room. He decided that my window that was open a crack, I leave it open for my dog he can get \"smell-o-vision\" while looking out the window.  While he is closing my window he falls on me while I am sleeping, I'm like \"WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!\"  He says, \"your window is making me cold.\"  Are you fucking serious!  I'm calling bullshit. \n\nLater on Sunday, after I go back to bed after being rudely awakened, I take my dog for a walk and prepare myself for a long day of playing video games and getting ready for the work week.  I'm playing away and DA comes up and claims that, \"either roommate #1 or myself had stolen some of his Xannax.\"  We are like \"Nope, didn't touch 'em.\"  He goes on to claim that we took them and he knows it and he is watching us. This has happened before, he takes sooo many that he \"blacks-out\" and forgets that he takes them himself. Then he blames it on whomever is closest.  Fine, whatever.  \n\nI wake up Monday hoping all the shenanigans are done, boy am I wrong.  I wake up to find a absolutely miserable DA.  All he wants is water and to relax.  I'm thinking, \"thank god!\"  It's over, the party is over.  I continue on with my day.  I come home to find an absolutely comatose DA.  I didn't know what was entirely going on but I thought he was just recovering.  I come into his room to wake him up because the night prior he woke me up at 4 am with his drunken shenanigans.  I see something chopped up into a \"line\" with a dollar bill ready to be snorted on his computer desk.  \"WTF is that,\" I think to myself. So this is shit where shit gets out of hand.\n\nTuesday morning, I'm getting ready for work.  I have to put my clothes in the dryer to un-wrinkle.  I'm too lazy to iron and too poor for the dry cleaners.  While putting on my clothes in the dryer I decide I should check on DA, he's been pretty quiet lately.  I open the door to his room and I see him laying there.  I'm like \"da......DA!!!!!!\"  Nothing.  I walk up too his bed while he is laying down on his back.  When I can finally start to see I start to see in the dark is vomit all over his mouth.  I went to EMT-B school.  I immediately start thinking that the situation is dire.  \n\nI turn on the light to his room, while I am freaking out.  Then I run back to him start slapping him in the face.  \"DA! DA! DA! DA, WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!!\"  He comes too but while he does I hear him gargling on something, I presume it was vomit.  The idea behind it makes me sick.  I start gagging all over.  Think I myself am about to vomit.  Roommate #2 hears the commotion and comes out.  He sees the situation and instructs DA to spit it out.  DA makes it through.  I get him some water then I go to work with all the mornings events on my mind.\n\nI have been thinking of this morning all day.  I can't get it out of my mind.  I am almost positive I just saw my roommate and longtime friend stare at death this morning.  Around 2 p.m. Tuesday I give DA a call to check up on.  He says that he is done and that was horrible.  He needs to chill out. THANK GOD x 2. It does not last.\n\nI come home Tuesday evening to find out that DA has been getting his party on, again, and that vodka &amp; MDMA was the money ticket again.  I talk to him telling him that, \"you're out of fucking control.  You need to chill the fuck out.\"  He agrees, mostly likely that the drugs agree.  I asked him if he was doing MDMA last night as well.  He tells me that it was not.  That in fact it was heroin......\n\n\"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!\"  Heroin, are you fucking shitting me.  Wow, just fucking wow.  I have been a long time weed smoker, but dabbled in some other things, but heroin is the next fucking level.  I go to work Wednesday and come home to a recovering DA.  He relaxes while watching some tv shows.  THANK GOD x 3.  Tells me that he is going to get back to normal.  \n\nI wake up Wednesday morning with the past week weighing heavy on me.  I like my friend, when he is normal.  But he is like this he is do dumb to talk to or try and hold an intellectual conversation with. He is a shell of his former self.  I don't what transpired that day but all I know is I come home to a DA killing a 24 pack of miller lite.  I have figured all hope is lost right now for DA.  I lock myself in my room on Wednesday trying to shut myself out of the situation but can't help myself thinking of it.\n\nI go to work Thursday still thinking of the past week.  I am going through my day of work and I get a message from a friend that DA wanted him to pick up a 6 pack for him.  Friend says, \"hell no.\"  I am not contributing to this bullshit you have been riding on for the past week.  DA gets furious.  DA is telling friend he is not worth his time and that instead of only a 6 pack DA got a giant bottle of vodka instead.  That brings me to the hear and now.\n\nDA is currently shitfaced passed out in his room rocking out to some Queen, although I kind of do enjoy the ambiance.  I sit hear writing this story looking for some advice and trying to get this off my chest.  This has been weighing heavy on me the past few days.  All I do know is that DA will not listen to anyone while he is intoxicated.  If you are not with him then you are obviously against him.  I am thinking of a few scenarios.  1) is confront DA at the next time he as his most sober and tell him of how much of an ass he has been. 2) Call his mother inform her of the situation. He is a momma's boy at heart and I almost think she could have the most impact, if she was fully aware of the situation.  3) Move the fuck out, back with my parents if need be.  Try and talk to DA but if he just shrugs it off his shoulders so be it and continue on with my life.\n\nI am looking for any other ideas. I am at my witts end reddit.  Thanks in advance. \n"

    "prompt": "I don't even know where to begin.  This is obviously a throwaway, I know reddiquette but please bare with me as english composition was never my best subject.  Backstory: I have know my roommate in question since middle school.  He has always like to party but I feel that this takes the absolute cake.  It is starting to affect my life and I am trying to generate a few ideas to try and confront the issue but it is a delicate situation. On with the story!\n\nThis all starts back on Back on Wednesday, April 24th around 10pm. My roommate, we will call DA for dumbass, just finished his class for the semester and decided to party. No big deal. I go to work the next morning, finish my day and then head home.  I find out DA is still drinking, a little crazy but fine. I have known DA likes to party pretty hard but, it really has never been that big of an issue, till now.....\n\nOn Thursday DA continues the drink-a-thon, hasn't stopped yet.  After I get home from work DA decides that MDMA is the drug of choice for the night.  DA is being all \"lovey\" with everything and everyone because of the drugs.  Thursday night is fairly uneventful.  I only wish that was the trend.\n\nOn Friday I wake up go to work and come home. I find out DA has bough Xannax, just cause.  He does Xannax all day Friday and Saturday(20 in total).  Sunday morning I am wake to the fact that DA is cold so he cranked the heat up to 85 then went into my room. He decided that my window that was open a crack, I leave it open for my dog he can get \"smell-o-vision\" while looking out the window.  While he is closing my window he falls on me while I am sleeping, I'm like \"WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!\"  He says, \"your window is making me cold.\"  Are you fucking serious!  I'm calling bullshit. \n\nLater on Sunday, after I go back to bed after being rudely awakened, I take my dog for a walk and prepare myself for a long day of playing video games and getting ready for the work week.  I'm playing away and DA comes up and claims that, \"either roommate #1 or myself had stolen some of his Xannax.\"  We are like \"Nope, didn't touch 'em.\"  He goes on to claim that we took them and he knows it and he is watching us. This has happened before, he takes sooo many that he \"blacks-out\" and forgets that he takes them himself. Then he blames it on whomever is closest.  Fine, whatever.  \n\nI wake up Monday hoping all the shenanigans are done, boy am I wrong.  I wake up to find a absolutely miserable DA.  All he wants is water and to relax.  I'm thinking, \"thank god!\"  It's over, the party is over.  I continue on with my day.  I come home to find an absolutely comatose DA.  I didn't know what was entirely going on but I thought he was just recovering.  I come into his room to wake him up because the night prior he woke me up at 4 am with his drunken shenanigans.  I see something chopped up into a \"line\" with a dollar bill ready to be snorted on his computer desk.  \"WTF is that,\" I think to myself. So this is shit where shit gets out of hand.\n\nTuesday morning, I'm getting ready for work.  I have to put my clothes in the dryer to un-wrinkle.  I'm too lazy to iron and too poor for the dry cleaners.  While putting on my clothes in the dryer I decide I should check on DA, he's been pretty quiet lately.  I open the door to his room and I see him laying there.  I'm like \"da......DA!!!!!!\"  Nothing.  I walk up too his bed while he is laying down on his back.  When I can finally start to see I start to see in the dark is vomit all over his mouth.  I went to EMT-B school.  I immediately start thinking that the situation is dire.  \n\nI turn on the light to his room, while I am freaking out.  Then I run back to him start slapping him in the face.  \"DA! DA! DA! DA, WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!!\"  He comes too but while he does I hear him gargling on something, I presume it was vomit.  The idea behind it makes me sick.  I start gagging all over.  Think I myself am about to vomit.  Roommate #2 hears the commotion and comes out.  He sees the situation and instructs DA to spit it out.  DA makes it through.  I get him some water then I go to work with all the mornings events on my mind.\n\nI have been thinking of this morning all day.  I can't get it out of my mind.  I am almost positive I just saw my roommate and longtime friend stare at death this morning.  Around 2 p.m. Tuesday I give DA a call to check up on.  He says that he is done and that was horrible.  He needs to chill out. THANK GOD x 2. It does not last.\n\nI come home Tuesday evening to find out that DA has been getting his party on, again, and that vodka &amp; MDMA was the money ticket again.  I talk to him telling him that, \"you're out of fucking control.  You need to chill the fuck out.\"  He agrees, mostly likely that the drugs agree.  I asked him if he was doing MDMA last night as well.  He tells me that it was not.  That in fact it was heroin......\n\n\"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!\"  Heroin, are you fucking shitting me.

This is nice.\"  So, I've quit several times.  I know I'm not physically addicted because I can go weeks without a drink and feel fine.  I always eventually get a craving for beer, though.  I start thinking \"a six pack\" would really hit the spot.  And even though a large part of me is telling the rest of me \"are we really gonna do this?   you hate alcohol!\"  I do it anyway.  And I'm a binge drinker so when that 6 pack is gone I say \"well, I'm not nearly intoxicated enough, I can still form complete sentences\" and go back to the store for 6 or 12 more.

    "prompt": "Backstory, I'm a 20 year old high school drop out. I dropped out at 16 for no reason whatsoever. My parents never made me do my homework; my parents always told me that I'm smart, so I figured \"why do it?\". Looking back, I wish I would have done things so much differently, but if I could reverse time, I don't know if it would be even possible for me to do anything different. I would play video games all day long and say to myself, \"tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow I'll catch up\". Tomorrow never came.\n\nI'm now attending online high school to try and finish up what I started, but I'm having the same problems here that I was having 4 years ago. I start every semester with a smile on my face thinking that things will be different, but day after day I get further and further behind and the mountain piles up once again. I have 6 days to finish basically 1.5 classes' worth of work. The real kicker is that none of it is hard work, it's fucking high school. All I would have to do is google most of the shit, but since it's so time consuming all I do is get bored and do something else. I can't focus for more than 10-20 minutes at a time. I also have to call my teachers once a week for participation. This is 10% of the grade, and I can't even pick up the phone when they call. They call non-stop and I never pick up. I don't know what I'm afraid of. Maybe it's disappointing them? Or that I'll seem dumb, or I'll have to lie my way out of it again like I do for everything in my life? I don't know.\n\nI know that it's possible for me to get better and fix things. I'm still young, but for some reason, just understanding the problem I have won't fix it.\n\n**tl;dr: I'm a 20 year old drop out that can't even keep up with easy high school work due to my procrastination. Help :(**"

    "prompt": "An old friend of mine - who I have a long up and down very intense relationship with - fell on hard times when the economy crashed.  We all did.  It hit him extra hard because he has ADD and lost his health insurance so he hasn't been on his meds for years at this point.  He ended up homeless and moved back to nowhere land Florida swamps with his parents for a while.\n\nRecently I went through some really traumatic shit.  My exfiance and I broke up after I got pregnant and I ended up losing the baby.  I also lost my job and became horribly depressed.  In an effort to not do stupid shit like sleep with 10 people in 3 months like the last time my ex and I broke up I figured it could be mutually beneficial for him to come out and stay on my couch.  I figured, even if this goes horribly, it'll keep me from making some bad decisions...\n\nWell, it's been over a month.  He also got a good job the first week he was here but he was rejected because of an outstanding drug warrant in another state.  I'm not sure if that just totally threw him off or what but he hasn't had any other interviews.  He hasn't filled out any paper applications and he SAYS he's called this old campaigning company I used to work at but he says no one has answered and I just called and they totally did.  I also know that he lies A LOT.\n\nIn fact, the lying is making me really crazy.  For instance I can't ask him where anything is because he'll just say he's never seen it.  Then when I find it and it's been moved he'll insist he's never touched it.  And he's so fast to answer.  Yesterday I asked him where the salt went and he immediately went off on this tangent about how he's never seen the salt and that someone else must've moved it, etc... Then I noticed the vegetable oil missing and didn't even bother to ask.  I knew what he would say...\n\nLater that day it came up and I asked and he immediately shot back that he'd never seen it.  Then the neighbor looks at me and says \"O, Casey let me borrow it while you were gone.  Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"No.  It's not a problem.\"  Especially if he had just said \"O, I let the nieghbors borrow it.\" But he didn't, he acted like it just disapeared because he was afraid I'd get mad he lent to the neighbors.  WTF?!\n\nSo, he lies a lot, he's not getting a job, and moreover I'm depressed and unemployed and he's making it more difficult to get motivated.  Moreover I'd like to be renting out my living room and he's in it.  All he does is watch internet tv, smoke cigarettes, and drink Four Loco all day.  O and he smokes my weed.  In fact, he smoked all my weed while I was on a trip in California and he blamed it on my pet rabbit.  He swore the rabbit ate the pot which I know is a lie.  My rabbit has never eaten pot.  This may make me sound irresponsible but I even offered pot to the rabbit before and he doesn't eat it.  Not sure why, he just doesn't.  The rabbit did NOT eat the pot.  But, he figured if he blamed it on the rabbit he wouldn't be required to buy more pot to replace it.\n\nI told him this morning that it's becoming too drawn out and he needs to really get in gear.  I want to tell him I need him out by the end of the month but I don't want to destroy our relationship.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEDIT: Omg, I just tried to explain to him why finding the salt is his responsibility because he was the last person to touch it and it has turned into world war III.  He insists that he put it in the same spot he got it and therefore someone else MUST HAVE moved it and therefore it is NOT his responsibility.  When I tried to explain to him that no one has seen it since he last used it he just said someone MUST HAVE moved it.  And then he tried to deflect and point out that I left the rabbits leash somewhere I normally don't and that he put it back so that he wouldn't \"get in trouble\".  And try to explain to him why it's okay for me to leave things AROUND MY OWN FUCKING APARTMENT THAT I PAY RENT ON.  And NO IT IS NOT OKAY FOR YOU TO LOSE MY SHIT.  YES IT IS OKAY FOR ME TO LOSE MY SHIT.  I PAY FOR MY SHIT AND I CAN LOSE IT YOU CAN'T.  Why am I having to do this with a fucking grown up.  What the holy fucking shit fucks."

    "prompt": "It’s officially Graduation time. Many of you are getting a fancy piece of paper soon. If your school is awesome it will say “Level up: Life Skill AWESOME acquired”. For most of you it will just say your name and some words in Latin. Sucks to suck.\n\nWhen I was an undergrad I remember looking forward to graduation so much. I thought to myself on a regular basis, “Just get through this. When it’s all done you’ll be able to make money and start your life”. By the time that day actually came, I was so underwhelmed with the college experience that I didn’t even bother to show up.\n\nAt least real life had started. And I was off to the races… Not really. I had to move back in with my mom because I hadn’t made any job plans and didn’t feel motivated to sign up for 2 more years of college. I basically spent a year screwing off before deciding I needed a Master’s Degree. With that degree I eventually ended up working at a college. Now, at 29 years old, I’m getting ready to leave to do something huge and I finally feel prepared for it because of the lessons I’ve learned here.\n\nIn the last 4 years I’ve met people who are in their early 20s who I consider peers and equals; people who organize groups, throw giant successful events and still have time to kick school’s ass; people who study abroad for months at a time (and sometimes decide not to come home);  people who make these crazy life altering decisions and go through so much pain for the sake of upholding a benevolent idea. I’ve learned a little bit from every single one of you. And I need you to know something else: You’ve changed my life. Just watching you do what you do has given me so much excitement about the world. You taught me the value of college just a few years late.\n\nThere are some of you who might be wondering what the value of your education is. You still might be in school. You still might be trying to figure out what it is you’re going to do with your life. I learned a lot about that these last 4 years. I noticed that everyone who was kicking ass had a few things in common and as I get ready to leave and attempt to spread the gospel of “Be Awesome” I’d like to share what I saw in them as a doctrine for excellence.\n\nAnd so I give you the 10 commandments of Being Awesome:\n\n1) Be a dork.\nA person who confidently and assertively loves dungeons and dragons is always cooler (and somehow more attractive to the opposite sex) than a person who wears a snapback and gets hammered for the sake of trying to look cool. It’s been amazing for me to realize that some of the most confident and respectable people are, in their heart of hearts, nerds that don’t give a shit if you call them nerds. Pay close attention to the people who you admire for doing extraordinary things. They are only able to do those things by breaking the boundaries of what is deemed as “normal”.\n\n\n \n2) Say YES to new things.\nThis was my single biggest failing as an undergrad. I didn’t join clubs because I didn’t want to feel like the new kid/outsider. I didn’t want to dance because I might look silly. I turned down hundreds of opportunities to do what was comfortable and ended up missing the boat entirely. If you’re going to be excellent you have to know who you are and what you offer. If you want to know who you are and what you offer, you have to figure out what you like and don’t like. If you want to find out what you like and don’t like, you have to try EVERYTHING you get access to. That all starts by saying Yes. The most excellent people at any college are involved in a few things. They understand the opportunities they’re missing if they just go to class and call that their education.\n\n\n \n3) Don’t take criticism personally\nEVERYONE who I saw accomplish something big these last 4 years was told in the beginning that what they wanted to do was not possible. In every situation I saw whoever was about to do something great say “fuck the haters. I’m doing it anyway” and then proceed to create something unbelievable. When someone says something is impossible, they mean it’s impossible for them. If you have a vision, break their rules. Break them often and don’t feel guilty. \n\n\n \n4) Embrace Failure.\nFor every good idea there are 10 bad ones. The key is to let bad ideas go and focus on the positives you’ve built. It’s cliche to say but failures aren’t people who fail. Failures are people who fail and feel sorry for themselves instead of going back to the drawing board with the lessons they’ve learned. Every awesome person I’ve met here has failed numerous times. The interesting thing is you’d never know it. Instead of whining about it on twitter, they went back in the lab and reformatted their ideas.\n\n \n\n5)Drink less.\nAnd smoke less weed. Sure you have to be social and casual beers are a way to get there. I’ll admit that many of the cool things that I’ve done here in the last few years were dreamed up over beers and bullshit. I’ll even concede that going out and getting hammered once in a blue moon is your right as an American. However, basing your life around getting messed up is like stopping time while continuing to get old. When you wake up, it’s astounding to see how much time has been lost. I’ve never met anyone who talks about getting wasted all week and lives an excellent life at the same time.\n\n\n \n6) Give everyone a chance.\nI always had a hard time with this because I always wanted to be seen with the “cool” kids in hopes of grabbing some of their status. I noticed something interesting about the people I consider to be excellent – they hang out with everyone. They have the oddest friends and they love them all. This gives them access to all sorts of strange worlds and social circles. Best friends come from strange and unexpected places so try not to judge anyone before you get to know them. This has a cool side effect too – when you try to see the positives in other people instead of judging them harshly, the voice that thinks other people are judging YOU harshly tends to shut up. I learned this just a couple of years ago from an 18 year old.\n\n\n \n7) Stop listening to grownups.\nAt some point you know more about you than your parents do. Embrace that fact. Run with it. Listen, I can tell you from experience that when you’re about to do something awesome , your parents are going to try to talk you out of it. They do that because they’ve had to stop your stupid ass from sticking your finger in a light socket from the time your chubby little legs could get you there. They’re trained to think you’re going to do the wrong thing because, let’s face it, you’ve done that thing a lot and their meddling has saved your fragile ignorant life. At some point, though,  you become a grown up. That means that your decisions are actually worth pursuing. No one can tell you when that is. You just have to know. Don’t wait for a diploma or a job or a wife to prove to yourself that you’re capable of making decisions. My guess is that if you’re interested enough in this to be reading this far, you’re already there. Now go do something.\n\n \n\n8)Help others instead of yourself.\nThis will be impossible until you get a handle on Number 6. Helping people does a lot. First, it fills a need for someone. Second, it reminds you that you are of some value to the world. Third, it puts value into the “community fund” which I’ll define as: People feeling good and connected. The value of that community fund is directly proportional to how easy it will be for you to be picked up on days when you feel like you’re out of gas. When you help yourself you’re only getting the first thing and the other 2 go untouched. As long as you can let other people help you, this is a much more sound investment. I do have to note that SO MANY people fuck this up. They call it karma or tit for tat and they want a reward for their good deed immediately. If you expect that, the thing doesn’t work because you’re not really helping someone else, you’re just trying to help yourself.\n\n\n \n9) Don’t stop learning.\nMost people stop learning around their sophomore year. Boredom has set in. They’re interested in grades and credits. If this is you, drop out of school immediately. Or at least utilize the other 4 million opportunities that college affords you by joining a club, taking up a new hobby, or better yet, going on a service trip. Learning has little to do with sitting in a classroom being talked at. I learned more in the last 4 years than I did in 6 years of higher education and I didn’t go to a single class except for when I was giving a lecture or playing pranks on Dr. Burch’s Human Sexuality Class. I learned all of it by meeting people who were interested in different things or collaborating on projects. The most engaged people I’ve met here were students who had side-hustles. They were using the school’s money to fund ski trips or climbing trips. They used the design labs to cook up their projects. They used the recording studio to record their band’s record. Oh and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TRAVELED. College is a great place to get acquainted with the world through travel. Every awesome person I know utilized that opportunity. I firmly believe that if you don’t, you are wasting your time and money.\n\n\n \n10) Life Starts Today\nAbove all else, you need to realize that you’re already the person you hope to become. Stop waiting. You might be 15 years old and you might be 40. Life starts today. Waiting for some day to come when someone else gives you a permission slip to live is a sure-fire one-way ticket to Sucksville. You want to know what happens in Sucksville? You spend your whole life doing a job you hate and waiting for your big break while watching TV and eating Chinese Food as a little treat once a week. Then you have a heart attack and die. Don’t go to Sucksville. It sucks there.\n\n \n\n\nThis stuff is easy. Being awesome doesn’t depend on your parents, or the amount of money you have, or what you’re good at. All you need to do is make the decision to behave in a manner that is more awesome. Saying yes is only a little different than saying no. Drinking less is just drinking less. It’s easy. If you can figure out how to stop listening to the voice in your head that is afraid of the unknown and instead say, “Fuck it, from now I’m gonna be awesome.” then you’ll be on your way to kicking ass in no time. I can actually guarantee that.\n\n\n\nYour first order of business? Start with #8 and share this with your friends. You’ll be helping me a lot. Thanks!\n\n \n\nWith love, cookies and rainbows,\n\nTed Winkworth\nSelf-Appointed graduate of the Class of 2013."

    "prompt": "I recently told my supervisor at work that my availability was changing, and I could no longer work evening shifts. I explained that I understood that my availability was hard to work with, and so if I needed to be let go I accepted that, but that if there was any way to stay with the company as a whole (I work in a side department in a grocery store) that I would love to stay.\n\nShe determined that she couldn't give me morning shifts, and put up a posting in the break room for my position. This is the last week I'm specifically scheduled to work in her department, as my availability changes on Thursday.\n\nBut the other day she asked me to work this thursday or friday, and again next monday. I told her I would check against my husband's schedule and get back to her. I left her a note after work last night telling her that I wouldn't be able to work those days due to his work schedule.\n\nSo at **5:50 AM** today, she sends me a text message that says \"Let's try this angle... what days/hours next week can you work??\"\n\nI'm upset that she chose to do it that way. I feel it was inappropriate to text me that early, especially after a late shift (I left work at 11pm last night), and I feel like I have no obligation to her because she put up a listing for my job. She's had someone apply for the position and she hasn't started the process of getting them transferred and trained... So I feel like her scheduling needs are kind of no longer my problem.\n\nDo you think I'm right, or am I still obligated to give her as many hours as I can until she has someone else in the position? My 2 week's notice would be up on Friday if I had put it in instead of changing my availability. Do I have to deal with her still?"

    "prompt": "So, lately I've been interested in this girl. We haven't talked a whole bunch, I don't really know her as well as I'd like but bear with me. \n\nSo last friday or so I did something I never knew I could do, I asked her (and her alone) to go to this music festival with me, and she accepted! (I felt amazing when she did). So we meet up, enter the venue, and we're just talking, I make a couple of jokes, she laughs. \n\nWe quickly run into some friends (I really hoped to avoid it and keep it just between the two of us, oh well) and we just talk to them for a bit, and then we just ended up hanging out with them for most of the festival, until this one artist she really liked started performing, so weslip away into the crowd and start watching. At this point I'm super close to her, and she doesn't seem to mind! But of this ended in a happy ending, I wouldn't be writing this, would I? So back to the festival, I'm standing really close to her, and I wanted to put my arm around her, but I just couldn't. I felt like I might intrude too much on her personal space, even though I was already well inside that.\n\nSo I manage to do it in the end, but not for long as the song ends and she announces she has to go now (she already said before we met up that she had to go a bit early.), so I walk her to the exit despite her saying I should meet up with my friends, or I might lose them (I did, but oh well, worth it.). So at the exit, she tells me she had a great time, we hug for a bit (it was more of a friends-hug) and she leaves. I proceed to find some coworkers there, but that doesn't really matter. \n\nFastforward 2 days, I'm writing this, and unsure how I should continue. I've been talking to her throught texts, she told me 'I wanted to go back to the venue after my appointment, but I didn't in the end' to which I replied: 'Oh that's too bad, I would've stayed if you came back' to which she replied 'next time'. I'm not even sure if this is relevant, but whatever, I have no clue how I should go about making my next move, so far I'm pretty certain we both like eachother, but I think it would be awkward for both her and me to just text her saying we should hang out (just the two of us that is.) it's not that I mind the hanging out, I just think it'd be too soon after the 'date'. Or something.\n\nSo reddit, what do you think I should do?\n\nP.S. I apologize for the ridiculously long read.\n\n**TL;DR I like a girl, went on a date, got a positive response, no idea how to make my move**"

    "prompt": "**Background:**\n\nI (F22) have been friends with this guy (M 24~) since we were housemates in Fall term at our university (September of last year.)  We grew to be pretty close, and even when I moved out I came over all the time to hang out.  We were in the same organization at Uni and studied together too.  Basically, I saw him more often my actual boyfriend, and we were pretty close. I told him everything and he trusted me enough to keep a key to the apartment even after I moved in with other friends.  Last February I helped him make rent ($100) because his financial aid was tied up after having taken a semester off, or at least that's what he told me.\n\nDespite feeling close to him and spending a lot of time with him, I am aware that he has a pride thing that leads him to lie and argue with people to save face (usually about minor things, like how he handles talking to girls. He's really dorky about it but pretends that he's the smoothest guy alive.)\n\n**Issue:**\n\nTowards the end of March, my friend started flaking out on our club at uni. He was the event coordinator, so his role was pretty important; but he wasn't showing up for meetings and wouldn't let us know what his plans were or if he couldn't make it until after we were in the meeting and texted him to ask if he was coming.\n\nHonestly, I know he was stressed out and over committed to multiple clubs plus his classes, but it was still pretty frustrating to deal with his lack of communication with us.\n\nHe facebooked us during the second meeting of the term to tell us that he couldn't make any meetings for the rest of the term and that we picked the worst meeting time for him (despite not having mentioned this before).  Our VP went off on him, firing off many messages about how he made a commitment to us and how she hoped he was flaking on his other organizations at the same time.  They got into an argument that quickly escalated to the point that I couldn't keep up with the thread and had no idea what the argument was about anymore.  The President (who was the guy's \"best friend\") and I threw in our two cents, which pretty much amounted to, next time tell us explicitly that 2pm would be a bad time for you, or we (obviously) would've known and chosen a different time for the meeting.\n\nThe next day, he quit the club and friendship broke up with the president.  He friendship broke up with me too, but didn't even tell me so.  I gave him a week to cool off before I approached him again (over facebook chat, because I knew his schedule was packed and wanted to give him the chance to answer on his own time while also being able to know whether he'd looked at my message or not.) \n\nI didn't apologize for the misunderstanding immediately, which I realized belatedly that I should've done given what i know about his pride. Instead, I asked if he wanted to hang out.  His reply was that he wasn't speaking to anyone from our club for a while because we all ganged up on him. At that point I apologized for misunderstanding him and for what happened (although I can't speak on behalf of the VP who did most of the arguing with him) and since then I haven't talked to him.\n\nIt's been a month now, and he still won't look at me if we pass each other and i give him a neutral greeting. I'm trying to give him space, but I do want to make up with him some time before the term ends because I care about him. School's over in a month, and I'm graduating and leaving here and I don't want to leave things unresolved. Also, he owes me 100 bucks.\n\nI want to approach him and make up, but don't know what I can say that's neutral enough to get him to talk to me so I can at least talk to him.  Failing that, I want to at least get him to pay me back the 100 that he owes me. However, I don't want him to feel like that's the only reason I want to talk to him, which would make him more resentful.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy guy friend friendship broke up with me over a misunderstanding that I have since apologized for. I've tried to give him space, but I feel like time is running out since I'm graduating in June and leaving town. I want to make up with him since we were close before and would like to keep him in my life for years to come. Failing that, I want to at least get him to pay me back the 100 I loaned him before he stopped talking to me.\n\nI'm asking advice on how to approach this guy in a neutral enough way to get him to hear me out.  I was thinking of asking him for 1-1 coffee or something, and then there explaining to him that I miss our friendship; if he never wants to associate with me again, okay, fair enough, but I still want my money back.  How does that sound?"

    "prompt": "Hello y'all! I'll try to keep this as short as possible. \n\nA couple of hours ago, this guy in my class (with whom i've only interchanged like 30 words in the whole school year, but i've catching him staring at me since the beginning of school)  sent me a message on facebook saying that he wanted to talk to me tomorrow after school, and when I asked him what he wanted to talk about he said it was something that he wanted to tell me since a long time ago and it was better if he did it on person. I think we all know what he wants to talk about. \n\nNow, my problem is that i'm a really shy girl inr (on the internet i'm a complete hot mess) and the thought of someone liking has always made me feel SO INCREDIBLY uncomfortable (I'm 20). The moment i read that he wanted to talk i started to feel anxious and uncomfortable and I'M STILL IN MY HOUSE. \n\nI'm already dreading tomorrow so much to the point that i think i'm going to skip school, because i feel that i cannot face him anymore. This isn't the only time that this has happened. Every time that someone shows a bit of a romantic interest in me i inmediatly feel awkward and anxious and all that. \n\nPlease give me an advise on how not to feel uncomfortable the next two months till school is over and if you're really kind, another one on how to tell him that i'm not interested in him. at all.\n\nI know this sounds stupid as shit but it's something that makes me feel really bad about myself.\n\nTL;DR: I'm lame.\n\nThank you soooooo much in advanced."

    "prompt": "I was together with my (ex)girlfriend for about 3 months. \n\nI am a pretty shy guy - she made the first move - so everything was fine.\n\nI really loved her and made everything for her. I guess I was a pretty good boyfriend but now I know that I was clinging to much. Because of that she could not value my effort. \n\nAt that time I didn't know that she did not really love me anymore and that she was chasing after every *pretty* guy. (When everything was over she admitted that she just chooses guys based on their appearance) When she broke up with me I was really crushed. I loved her so much and she was my 1st real love. \n\nAt that point I made some mistakes and tried to get her back ... texted her like everyday and stuff like that. We tried to remain friends but this didn't last very long because - like in the relationship the effort just came from my side. She did nothing. I was sad but everything was *normal*\n\nThen she started sending me pictures of other guys and told me that she is \"so in love\" and stuff like that. It did hurt me pretty bad but I didn't say anything because I thought she would break contact with me then...\n\nWe were arguing like everyday via sms and other messengers. Both of us were just bringing forward arguments and after every accusation you had this feeling *I have to answer and can't let her win* so it went on and on.\n\nThen I realized that the contact with my (ex)girlfriend is very bad for me and my health (I became depressed and so on). So I told her to stop approach me and I didn't approach her anymore.\n\nAnd here is my problem now: She just WON'T stop. Always sending messages in facebook (always starting with a blame - so you have really no inclination to answer). At first I answered and we were arguing again but then I stopped. \nNow she went full retard. Always asking mutual friends what i was talking about with them. She always knows about stuff I never ever told her and is writing and asking about - I never answer.\n\n\nToday I blocked her on facebook etc... I got told (by a mutual friend) that she is really mad and says i am a pussy and just hiding from my problems (so her?!..) and stuff like that. I really don't get it. She just won't leave me alone and is still annoying me at school. \n\nShe even told me that it's fun for her to annoy me and the reason for this is that after our break up I had been writing a lot to her. (I tried to get her back because I was still in love). But is this really a reason to annoy me now? Like 5 months after everything happened? Even her close friends are on my side and tell her to stop it... What can I do?\n\nMore information: \nWe are in the same school\nI see her about every day &gt;.&lt;\n\nPS: Sorry for my bad english.

    "prompt": "I am a liar and I don’t know how to stop. \n\nBackstory: \nMy boyfriend and I have been dating since June 2011 and have been in a long distance relationship since September 2011. A few months after we became long distance I started hanging out with a group of friends. One of the friends made it clear that he was interested in me and I told my boyfriend that. I told my boyfriend that I could not cheat on him with, let’s call him “Greg”. My boyfriend believed me yet was still not happy with us hanging out. This group of friends were my only friends at the time so I did not want to stop hanging out with them because Greg liked me. It resulted to me lying to my boyfriend about hanging out with them because I didn’t want him to be angry with me. He looked past it.  \n\nIn January 2012 I moved different states to attend college; however my boyfriend and I are still just as far apart. Our relationship was great during my spring semester of freshman year.  During the summer before my sophomore year I moved 1000 miles to where he lives so I could spend all summer living with him. Even though it was a financial sacrifice for the both of us, I found a job and all was well. I moved back to my college in the fall. Everything was fine until spring 2013.  \n\nI had become better friends with a mutual friend who just got out of a relationship. I knew what it was like to be apart from an SO, so I kept him company through this difficult time. Nothing was out of the ordinary until my boyfriend wanted to Skype less and less. We used to Skype for hours at a time about 4-6 days a week. This turned into Skyping 4 hours a week, then 2, then none, with minimal texts. I figured he was just playing video games and didn’t have time for me. He did have a slight problem with wanting to game while I was visiting him for a week and we hadn’t seen each other in three months.   \n\nEvery now and then he would ask me if we were “losing it”. I denied it because I wanted nothing but to be with him. His doubts occurred frequently so I thought he was in the process of trying to break up with me.   \n  \n\nDuring this time, I had been getting closer and closer to the friend who lost his SO. We’ll call him Peter. Peter made it clear that he liked me a lot. I thought my boyfriend was ready to move on, so I got closer to Peter. It started with watching movies and cuddling, it eventually led to us having sex. This is how I lied again. I told Peter than my boyfriend and I was in an open relationship since we live so far away. (My boyfriend has discussed this, but the topic moved no further.)   \n\nSo, Peter thought this was allowed, and my boyfriend had no idea. We had sex once before I visited my boyfriend for spring break. Peter dropped me off at the bus station, he left crying.   \n\nI got to my boyfriend’s and I realized things felt different between us. My second night back he played video games all night and I fell asleep as I watched him. He then woke me up at 3 am to have sex and go to sleep.  \n\n\nAfter spring break I return and resume things with Peter. We essentially become friends with benefits, always hanging out, playing video games together, and we had sex four more times up until now.\nDuring this time period after spring break, my boyfriend grew suspicious of mine and Peter’s friendship. Many times he questioned it, but I lied. I lied when I went places with him, about hanging out with him, and so on. I lied so my boyfriend wouldn’t get mad at me for hanging out with Peter.  \n\n\nPeter asked me if we would ever be together, I said I love my boyfriend. Later, Peter started seeing a girl. He went on a date with her and he was very happy. He asked me if I was jealous and I said yes. He felt bad, but I could tell he was still happy. He was moving on from me because he realized I wasn’t going to break up with my boyfriend. I got extremely jealous and upset and that’s when I realized I fell in love with Peter.   \n\n\nI told Peter this and he said he could end things with the girl he was seeing and I could end things with my boyfriend. I already was not happy with my boyfriend not talking to me and being in an LDR with no ending as far as we could see. Peter was more caring and we had better sex. I think my boyfriend was just taking me for granted. So on Monday night after Peter told the girl he was seeing it wasn’t going to work, I Skyped my boyfriend and tried to break up with him. We Skyped for five hours because he was trying to keep me from breaking up with him. I told him I was in love with two people and didn’t know what to do. I felt like I was at a point of no return because Peter gave up the girl he liked for me. I couldn’t back down. I just wanted to make my boyfriend angry at me instead of sad. So it’d be easier. But instead, he just got more upset. After five hours, I told him it was over and that we’d talk again. His reaction made me feel like worse than dirt. He was afraid of me getting too close to Peter.   \n\n\nSo ultimately, I chose to go back to my boyfriend and I told Peter that I couldn’t break up with me. It made him very upset and he said he’d wait for me. Since then, I have told my boyfriend the truth about everything. Me and Peter, I even told him how I cheated on him.     \n\n\nMy boyfriend is willing to put everything behind him and continue to date me, because he said almost losing me was a wake up call for him and he said he’d pay more attention to me/talk to me for more than 15 minutes a week. I am just afraid that we’ve gone past the point of no return. I love both men. My boyfriend said the only way this can work is if I never talk to Peter again. But I cant. We’re best friends. We hang out all the time and I am not ready to give that up. We signed a lease to live together (before I fell in love with him). My boyfriend is willing to give up his job and leave his family to live in my state. My parents barely trusted letting me live off campus, so if I tell them I’m not living in the house I signed for, I’ll be in big trouble.    \n\n\nMy ultimatum is that I stay with my boyfriend, who never wants me to talk to my best friend anymore (which is TOTALLY understandable) however, I’m not ready to do that as I will be living with him and I love him. Or, I break my boyfriends heart and he loses the thing that means most to him: me.    \n\n\nI don’t want either. I feel like I don’t deserve Peter after what I did and how I lied to him, and I DEFINITELY don’t deserve my boyfriend who I did this too.\nI’m just confused.\n"

Our relationship was great during my spring semester of freshman year.  During the summer before my sophomore year I moved 1000 miles to where he lives so I could spend all summer living with him. Even though it was a financial sacrifice for the both of us, I found a job and all was well. I moved back to my college in the fall. Everything was fine until spring 2013.  \n\nI had become better friends with a mutual friend who just got out of a relationship. I knew what it was like to be apart from an SO, so I kept him company through this difficult time. Nothing was out of the ordinary until my boyfriend wanted to Skype less and less. We used to Skype for hours at a time about 4-6 days a week. This turned into Skyping 4 hours a week, then 2, then none, with minimal texts. I figured he was just playing video games and didn’t have time for me. He did have a slight problem with wanting to game while I was visiting him for a week and we hadn’t seen each other in three months.   \n\nEvery now and then he would ask me if we were “losing it”. I denied it because I wanted nothing but to be with him. His doubts occurred frequently so I thought he was in the process of trying to break up with me.   \n  \n\nDuring this time, I had been getting closer and closer to the friend who lost his SO. We’ll call him Peter. Peter made it clear that he liked me a lot. I thought my boyfriend was ready to move on, so I got closer to Peter. It started with watching movies and cuddling, it eventually led to us having sex. This is how I lied again. I told Peter than my boyfriend and I was in an open relationship since we live so far away. (My boyfriend has discussed this, but the topic moved no further.)   \n\nSo, Peter thought this was allowed, and my boyfriend had no idea. We had sex once before I visited my boyfriend for spring break. Peter dropped me off at the bus station, he left crying.   \n\nI got to my boyfriend’s and I realized things felt different between us. My second night back he played video games all night and I fell asleep as I watched him. He then woke me up at 3 am to have sex and go to sleep.  \n\n\nAfter spring break I return and resume things with Peter. We essentially become friends with benefits, always hanging out, playing video games together, and we had sex four more times up until now.\nDuring this time period after spring break, my boyfriend grew suspicious of mine and Peter’s friendship. Many times he questioned it, but I lied. I lied when I went places with him, about hanging out with him, and so on. I lied so my boyfriend wouldn’t get mad at me for hanging out with Peter.  \n\n\nPeter asked me if we would ever be together, I said I love my boyfriend. Later, Peter started seeing a girl. He went on a date with her and he was very happy. He asked me if I was jealous and I said yes. He felt bad, but I could tell he was still happy. He was moving on from me because he realized I wasn’t going to break up with my boyfriend. I got extremely jealous and upset and that’s when I realized I fell in love with Peter.   \n\n\nI told Peter this and he said he could end things with the girl he was seeing and I could end things with my boyfriend. I already was not happy with my boyfriend not talking to me and being in an LDR with no ending as far as we could see. Peter was more caring and we had better sex. I think my boyfriend was just taking me for granted. So on Monday night after Peter told the girl he was seeing it wasn’t going to work, I Skyped my boyfriend and tried to break up with him. We Skyped for five hours because he was trying to keep me from breaking up with him. I told him I was in love with two people and didn’t know what to do. I felt like I was at a point of no return because Peter gave up the girl he liked for me. I couldn’t back down. I just wanted to make my boyfriend angry at me instead of sad. So it’d be easier. But instead, he just got more upset. After five hours, I told him it was over and that we’d talk again. His reaction made me feel like worse than dirt. He was afraid of me getting too close to Peter.   \n\n\nSo ultimately, I chose to go back to my boyfriend and I told Peter that I couldn’t break up with me. It made him very upset and he said he’d wait for me. Since then, I have told my boyfriend the truth about everything. Me and Peter, I even told him how I cheated on him.     \n\n\nMy boyfriend is willing to put everything behind him and continue to date me, because he said almost losing me was a wake up call for him and he said he’d pay more attention to me/talk to me for more than 15 minutes a week. I am just afraid that we’ve gone past the point of no return. I love both men. My boyfriend said the only way this can work is if I never talk to Peter again. But I cant. We’re best friends. We hang out all the time and I am not ready to give that up. We signed a lease to live together (before I fell in love with him). My boyfriend is willing to give up his job and leave his family to live in my state. My parents barely trusted letting me live off campus, so if I tell them I’m not living in the house I signed for, I’ll be in big trouble.    \n\n\nMy ultimatum is that I stay with my boyfriend, who never wants me to talk to my best friend anymore (which is TOTALLY understandable) however, I’m not ready to do that as I will be living with him and I love him. Or, I break my boyfriends heart and he loses the thing that means most to him: me.    \n\n\nI don’t want either. I feel like I don’t deserve Peter after what I did and how I lied to him, and I DEFINITELY don’t deserve my boyfriend who I did this too.\nI’m just confused.\n"

He is very well off and enjoys many luxuries but has long struggled with depression.\nA few years ago, he decided to get a dog, for company and emotional support. He has held on to a high-paying job, and so I thought he would do a good job taking care of the dog. But he never trained her: She isn’t housebroken, she often bit us while young and she cannot be left unsupervised. Worse, I believe he is neglecting the dog, out of an inability or lack of desire to change his lifestyle. He takes her out only about twice a day, the first time when he wakes up, usually between noon and 2 p.m. He never takes the dog for walks, only out to relieve herself, which takes about five to 10 minutes. (This breed of dog requires an hour of exercise per day, I’ve read.) He also keeps the dog in his bedroom with him most of the day, evidently because she is not housebroken enough to roam the apartment. When I’ve taken care of the dog while he is on vacation, I’ve put her on a more normal schedule of walks and regular pee breaks. During those periods, she has been very well behaved and able to roam the place.\nI have never confronted my roommate about this. But I’ve made many suggestions, including that he get a dog walker or dog day care (which he could easily afford); I’ve commented on how her behavior changes, and how she enjoys her walks, when I take care of her. I worry that confronting him will ruin our relationship, but I am saddened every day about the dog’s treatment.\n"

These and other behaviors became intolerable to me as I entered my 20s, and I distanced myself until firmly cutting off all contact about five years ago.\nI do not miss him and have never regretted that choice. Moreover, and maybe this marks me as a cold individual, I no longer have contact with his side of the family — we were never close and shared no warmth. My father’s sibling, however, died recently, and while I have no concerns that I was unable to say goodbye to them, I have found myself wondering what I will do and feel when my elderly father passes.

The tour is very structured, with little personal time. Our group makes up a majority of the tour.\nJohn seems to think that we should all accept his new identity without reservation, with as much cheer and acceptance as he does for himself, not thinking or caring about how any of us might feel.\nAs superficial as this sounds, we no longer want our friend John to join us. There are reasons that gay men enjoy traveling together, and it’s not to hang around with a woman.\nStraight people imagine that gay men view trans men/women in the same inclusive bubble as other gay men. We are all, so the acronym implies, part of that big, progressive L.G.B.T.Q.+ umbrella. Not true. In general, gay men (for all of our performances of femininity) do not understand trans identity — we don’t commonly socialize together.\nThe bottom line is that John’s presence will spoil a much-anticipated and expensive vacation.
