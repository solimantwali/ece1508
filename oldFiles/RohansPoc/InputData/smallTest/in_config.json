    "Reddit, I'm a lazy asshole. I've been like that my entire high school career and it finally came to bite me back in the ass. I started off Grade 10 in Alberta, Canada. I've always had problems with waking up and going to school so around halfway through the year, the anxiety of going to a class that I've missed for days really built up and I just stopped going in the end. That's the story of how I failed Grade 10.\n\nNow, I move to Ontario for Grade 11, hoping that it would be better. I kind of cheated my way around the system and since I didn't have an official school transcript, they just had me do an equivalence test to determine where I should be in for what courses. I failed Math but passed English so I got placed into Grade 10 applied Math and Grade 11 University Eng. The deal was that when I passed my courses, they would give me the pre-requisite credits for the courses. That basically put me back on track for Grad, since I would only be behind a tiny bit.\n\nWhen I started school there, the councillor gave me the benefit of the doubt and enrolled me into Bio 20 as well, believing that I completed Science 10. Soon enough, I started having the same problems with waking up and I fell back into the same loop and failed another year. I dropped out the coming fall semester out of depression but re enrolled into a different school for Spring. This school was the first time I've pulled my head out of my ass and actually did really well. I finally had completed Math 10 and English 20 with high 80's, and it was one of the most gratifying feelings I've ever had. Riding on the high of my small success and the depression that my girlfriend had recently left me, I decided to move back to Alberta to graduate.\n\nEverything from this moment on started from last August when I did the move. My transcript didn't update properly like they promised and I never got the pre-requisite credits that I was supposed to get. Instead, I was left with only 3 credits out of 30 and those were for the courses I passed. Fell into a loop of depression again and it's only been recently in around February where I decided I need to go back to school again. All I want to do is graduate but at the pace I'm at now, I won't be doing that until I'm 21-22. I know how much I've fucked up in my life and I know that I'm ready for change.",
    "Hey everyone, this is a throwaway account.\n\n\nI'm a 20 year old male college student. I had a girlfriend for a while back in high school that I had sex with a few times (6 or 7), and since coming to college I have slept with 2 girls (both were friends and it was a 1 time thing both times), but both times I was so excited that I came after only a minute or two. I also masterbate just about every night, and unless I'm trying to make myself last longer by taking breaks or something then I usually cum in about a minute (sorry if that was too graphic, but I'm in desperate need of some advice!). Making up excuses to cover my quickness in bed was tremendously embarrassing, and now I'm afraid to even talk/flirt with girls that I meet at parties, etc. or pursue a possible relationship because I know that if it comes down to it I will not be able to perform during sex, resulting in another episode of overwhelming embarrassment. I can talk and have a great time with girls who have boyfriends (no pressure and I'm not worried). \n\n\nI'm not having anxiety or anything, I just feel worthless and see no point in going to parties or typical college social situations because everyone is honestly just trying to get laid (my school is a lot of preppy bros, but not me haha). I'm getting pretty lonely because most of my friends are at parties having the time of their life flirting with girls while I'm hanging out in my room playing video games.\n\n\nThis fear of failure is now so intense that girls on campus debate if I am real because none of them have ever met me in person... I'm a fairly attractive guy (athletic, tall, blonde), and the few girls that are my friends (and a few guys) have tried to encourage me to be more social and flirt with girls. I obviously can't explain what's really going on, and I'm truly lost. I was at a party last week and a girl was all over me, playing withy hair and everything, but I just took myself out of the situation and left to go grab a drink with some friends instead. I also retreat/remove myself from the situation whenever a girl flirts with me in any way (and I'm bad at this, so I'm probably misinterpreting a lot of things and just driving myself away for no reason).\n\n\n**TL;DR** I'm in college and I have only had sex a few times and I cum really fast (1-2 minutes).",
    "So, my best friend of two years (girl) and I are going through troubles. We have been super close friends and talk daily and quiet frankly given the chance i would date her but that's not the main point. The main point is her boy friend of (on and off) 7 months hates my guts even though we've never said a word to each other. he always \"makes fun of me\" (the kid is as dumb as a brick and i'm not just saying that) and tells her that she should stop talking to me and all that crap. And she recently got tired of it and fought with him. (they have fights like monthly its a bad relationship all my friends agree) So here i was talking to her as she cries about it and im trying to support her like a good friend and i told her break up and actually do it this time. and after about a day of telling her it's completely pointless to stay in the relationship she does the deed and things start to get slowly better that day. We spent the whole night talking and occasionally bring him up and she would say she regrets dating him and getting back with him all those time ect. I though it would only get better. Nope, next day at school (happend over the weekend like always, almost seems like he plans this stuff.) every time she saw him she got all up set and at the end of the day she was crying. After a hard relationship i would expect problems when ever she saw him. it's normally always like that. But her immediate reaction is to try and get back with him. He obviously takes her back cause he likes having control or some junk. The whole time she was trying to get back with him i was telling her not to and that she'll regret it. She called me a dick for it. i was ready to cry. we kind of made up after that kinda. and that day i got 2 jobs ( what are the chances) and after talking with friends that all agree i should leave her cause she's nuts i decided that i just wont talk with her as much. i told her that because of the 2 jobs i wouldnt be able to talk as much. the entire conversation she only responded with yep, sure, okay. Never a good sign. and i talked to her again later and again simple non exciting words are used and i feel like our dying friendship is about to fall on a chainsaw. Any thoughts would be accepted i just want opinions (Pardon me for any grammatical errors)",
    "For many months now, the same presumed homeless man has been hiding things in my trash cans/recycling bins and around the property, rummaging through the bins (for no particular reason?!), and sleeping in my laundry room. He does these activities at any time of day or night, and these bins are literally right outside my window. Sometimes he is gone for weeks, but he always makes his way back. \n\nI have called the police on him countless times. They have offered no advice, and he has to physically be present for the full half an hour or whatever it takes for the police to get here. Then when the police arrive, they take him away (I have no idea where), and he is literally back the next day.\n\nI have talked to the homeless man probably about 10 times. He obviously does not give a shit about me or have any desire to respect me. My roommate and I have both warned him that if he continues hiding things that we will literally throw his things out. He continued hiding things, and one day I literally threw out a garbage bin's full of his things. He seemed to get the picture after this, but lo and behold, he is back, with his same old routine.\n\nI am at a loss as to what I can possibly do. I've thought about threatening him with violence, but I really don't want to do that to anyone, and I don't want to do anything illegal.\n\n[Edit]: In case this wasn't clear, I have used every possible humane and decent tactic, such as asking nicely to not make noise at night (this is my main problem), etc. The man is mentally ill, possibly a thief, and is illegally trespassing on private property. He does not listen to logic because he cannot listen to logic. Let me perhaps rephrase my question:\n\nHow do I get a mentally ill, disruptive, irreverent squatter off of my private property for good?",
    "So I have a Jeep Wrangler with a soft top. Person entered my Jeep by unzipping the back window. They \"tried\" to steal my radio. I use tried loosely because they look like they didn't know what they were doing. The radio is in really good. \n\nI wouldn't doubt if they would come back and try again. My first reaction was to put a bunch of thumbtacks in the back so if they enter that way again they will at least get a little bit of a sting. But I believe I could get in trouble for this, even if the asshole is breaking into my car.\n\nMaybe I can put a towel in the back and cover it with oil? At least I can piss them off before they get to the front of the Jeep. Other thoughts?",
    "When I was much, much younger, in my late teens, I had a serious boyfriend. At the time, I was convinced he and I would be together forever. I got a tattoo of his name on my body in a spot that no one else would ever see. He thought it was so romantic and our love was intense.\nFast forward a few years and we broke up. First love crushed. We both took years to move on, but we did. After a few years of dating, I found a new guy when I was in my late twenties and was certain he was the one. The tattoo bothered him, but I was able to manipulate it to read this guy’s name, as luckily the two shared some common letters. My man was pleased.\nSadly, some tragedy befell us and our relationship ended. I’m devastated and now have the two loves of my life forever inked in my skin…… but no guy in my life. How am I ever going to get over this, and deal with this tattoo?\n",
    "I’m a shy 31-year-old male who’s had only one relationship, starting with two years’ just dating, then four years in university where we lived together off-campus.\nAfter graduation we moved to different cities, having recognized that we’d become “best friends” only.\nI’m hoping now to meet someone special. I go to a nearby dog-walking park with my Beagle every morning hoping that we’ll meet “The One.”\nBut I lack any skills at chatting up females to whom I’m attracted. Your suggestions?\n",
    "I am friends with a single mother who works two low-wage jobs. There are some months when she can’t pay her bills. I have loaned her money many times.\nThe problem is that it’s like pulling teeth to get my money back. She seems to feel as if, because I get a decent retirement check and Social Security check, I don’t need my money back. Also, whenever we go out to eat, she feels as if I should pick up the tab.\nI worked for 33 years for the state where I live, which has one of the highest costs of living in the country, so I need to be careful with my money. How can I get her to understand that I need my money?\n",
    "My little sister took over the family farm and has been running it (with my other sister) for two years. It is an incredible amount of work, and it keeps her busy from sunup to sundown. A year and a half ago, she had a son. I offered to watch him. I am a stay-at-home mom for my own boys, so no problem. We live with my parents, whose home sits right on the farm property. My sister offered money, but I said I was happy to watch him without payment.\nI agreed to this without first discussing it with my husband. But what had started out as a few days a week quickly turned into six days from breakfast to dinnertime. This started to cut into my own family time. My husband refused to help me on his days off because he had not agreed to it. We both became increasingly fatigued and bitter.\nWe went to marriage counseling. Our counselor said it was unfair that I had not discussed it with my husband from the beginning and that I should cut back on the babysitting commitment. I did, and we both felt better.\nI had a baby in February, and I told my sister I would like a “maternity leave.” But I told her if she wanted to move into the empty lot next to us, I would be willing to watch her child during my baby’s infancy. When I told my husband, he was distraught. He said that I did this without his consent again and that he would have said no if I had asked him first.\nI understand why he is upset. I should have communicated before offering. But I also wonder why I need his permission to do something that I enjoy doing, that helps out a family member and that blesses my own children. My husband never has to watch this child at all. Can he tell me what I can and can’t do in this regard? It seems a bit controlling to me. Or am I missing something?\n"
