You can't wait until happiness falls on your lap, because you'll end up waiting forever.\n\nIf you lack drive and such, then find a goal, plan how to achieve that goal, and execute the plan.  Keep doing this, and soon you'll realize these small wins and achievements make you a better person, AND make you happier with yourself.\n\nAnd NO, video game achievements and trophies don't count.",
    "sft_reply": "assistant\n\nIt takes courage to admit when you're not feeling fulfilled, so kudos to you for recognizing it! Lacking drive and determination can be a challenging and frustrating experience. I'm here to help you explore ways to regain that spark.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to not be happy with yourself at times. It's a normal part of life, and it doesn't mean you're flawed or inadequate. It's possible that you've been pushing yourself too hard or setting unrealistic expectations, leading to burnout.\n\nTo start, let's identify some potential factors contributing to your lack of drive and determination. Have you experienced any significant changes or stressors in your life recently, such as a job change, relationship issues, or health concerns? Are there any specific areas where you feel stuck or unfulfilled?\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few strategies to help you cultivate a more positive relationship with yourself:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect and that you're doing the best you can.\n2. **Set realistic goals**: Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks. Celebrate your small wins to build momentum and confidence.\n3. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time in nature.\n4. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take a step back and assess what's truly important to you. Focus on aligning your actions with your values and passions.\n5. **Seek support**: Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. Sometimes talking through your struggles with someone who cares can help you gain new perspectives and feel more motivated.\n\nRemember, regaining your drive and determination takes time, patience, and self-awareness. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be afraid to explore different approaches until you find what works for you.\n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you? Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or any additional questions you have?"

    "human": "They would have to be a pretty amazing person for me to overlook their belief in imaginary people.",
    "sft_reply": "assistant\n\nAs an atheist, it's natural to have concerns about dating someone with religious beliefs, especially when it comes to raising children. I'll share my thoughts and those of other atheists to help you make a decision.\n\nMany atheists I've spoken to would not rule out dating someone who believes in God, as long as the individual is not pushy or judgmental about their faith. However, having open and honest conversations about your values, beliefs, and expectations is crucial. It's essential to discuss how you both envision raising your future children, including the role of religion in their lives.\n\nIf you decide to continue dating, some potential boundaries you could discuss include:\n\n1. Religious education: You might ask your partner to agree that you'll not force religious beliefs on your children, but instead, allow them to make their own choices about spirituality as they grow older.\n2. Co-parenting: Establish a clear understanding of how you'll approach religious discussions and activities with your children. You might agree to expose them to different beliefs and values, encouraging critical thinking and open-mindedness.\n3. Personal beliefs: Discuss how you'll handle situations where your partner's beliefs conflict with your own. Will you compromise, or will you prioritize your own values?\n4. Raising kids: Consider how you'll handle situations like school prayer, church activities, or religious-themed holidays. Will you participate or opt out?\n5. Respect and compromise: Emphasize the importance of mutual respect and understanding in your relationship. Be willing to listen to each other's perspectives and find common ground.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own values and beliefs, but it's also essential to be open-minded and willing to learn from each other.\n\nIn your case, since you've only had one date, it's understandable to be hesitant. Take the time to get to know your partner better, have open conversations, and gauge their willingness to respect your beliefs and values. If you feel like they're genuinely open to compromise and understanding, it might be worth exploring further.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. Weigh the pros and cons, and trust your instincts."

    "sentence": "How to stop being an emotional abuser My marriage is on the verge of ending, and I know it's my fault. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. \n\nAnyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck. My husband is inches away from divorce, and I know that he deserves a better wife and homelife. How do I stop? Especially since I didn't know I was doing it. \n\nPlease help!",
    "human": "First step is responsibility. Remember that it doesn't matter that you didn't know you were doing it,  or how bad it makes you feel to be an abuser. Don't burden him by asking him to forgive you,  he has been through enough. \n\nHe probably feels disrespected, unimportant, and unloved. Approach this by seeking a therapist (not a marriage therapist- one just for you, to overcome your problem) so he can see that you acknowledge his feelings, and also for your sake as a person. \n\nI would also advise to move to another room in the house to further reiterate you're serious about changing. Your mere presence probably makes him uneasy,  and this way he can have room to feel more like himself. It shows respect and consideration,  which is a form of love.\n\nThroughout the process, remember he doesn't owe you anything. Not forgiveness, or even kindness. He's pissed off as hell- let him be. Be patient, be kind, listen well. Whenever you feel like you're about to take a step back in progress,  excuse yourself from the room to deal with your feelings. \n\nGood luck saving your marriage.\n\nSource: Domestic Violence survivor of a male - female relationship.

    "sft_reply": "assistant\n\nI'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and confront the harm you've caused. Recognizing the signs of emotional abuse is a crucial step towards change.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and it's never too late to make amends and work towards healing. It's essential to understand that emotional abuse is a pattern of behavior, and it's not a one-time mistake. However, acknowledging and taking responsibility for your actions is a significant step forward.\n\nTo stop being an emotional abuser, you'll need to address the underlying issues and develop healthier communication and relationship skills. Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult a therapist or counselor who specializes in domestic violence and emotional abuse. They can help you understand the root causes of your behavior, develop coping mechanisms, and work on rebuilding trust with your husband.\n2. Take responsibility: Acknowledge your actions and the harm they've caused. Apologize sincerely and make amends. This doesn't mean making excuses or downplaying your behavior, but rather taking ownership of your actions and committing to change.\n3. Learn healthy communication skills: Practice active listening, empathy, and assertiveness. Learn to express your feelings and needs without resorting to manipulation or aggression.\n4. Work on self-awareness: Identify your triggers and learn to recognize the signs of your own emotional distress. Practice self-care, mindfulness, and stress management techniques to regulate your emotions.\n5. Focus on building a healthier relationship: Work with your husband to establish boundaries, communicate openly, and rebuild trust. This may involve attending couples therapy or counseling sessions together.\n6. Educate yourself: Continuously learn about emotional abuse, its signs, and its effects. This will help you develop a deeper understanding of the harm you've caused and the importance of change.\n7. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups who can offer guidance and encouragement. Sharing your experiences and hearing from others who have gone through similar struggles can be incredibly empowering.\n\nRemember, healing and growth take time. Be patient with yourself, and don't expect overnight changes. Focus on making progress, not perfection.\n\nLastly, please know that your husband deserves a safe, loving, and respectful relationship. If he's inches away from divorce, it's crucial to prioritize his needs and well-being. It may take time for him to heal and rebuild trust, but it's essential to respect his boundaries and give him space if needed.\n\nRemember, you are capable of change, and it's never too late to start. Keep in mind that it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time."

Activities are never fun if you're in your head worrying over how you appear or contemplating what you'll do for the rest of your day. I made this mistake my entire life. The only thing that I could do to be present during an activity was play video games or read.

    "sft_reply": "assistant\n\nThat can be frustrating! It's like she's leaving the decision-making entirely up to you. Here's a suggestion: have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling.\n\nYou could say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed that whenever we wake up, I'm always the one suggesting what we do. I love spending time with you, but I feel like I'm always taking the lead. Can we talk about how you're feeling? What's going on that's making it hard for you to decide on an activity?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're willing to listen to her perspective and understand what's going on. It also gives her an opportunity to open up about any underlying issues or concerns she may have.\n\nAdditionally, you could try asking more open-ended questions like, \"What's something you've been wanting to try or do recently?\" or \"Is there something that's been on your mind that you haven't had a chance to do?\" This can help her feel more engaged and invested in the decision-making process.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay if she doesn't have an answer right away. It's possible that she's just not feeling motivated or inspired, or maybe she's going through a tough time and needs some extra support. By having a supportive and non-judgmental conversation, you can help her feel more comfortable opening up and finding activities that bring her joy.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to find a balance between compromise and respect for each other's feelings. By communicating openly and honestly, you can work together to find activities that you both enjoy and that bring you closer together."

    "sentence": "Previous Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r1c7cg/found\\_out\\_that\\_myf22\\_boyfriendm23\\_who\\_recently/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r1c7cg/found_out_that_myf22_boyfriendm23_who_recently/)\n\nMy boyfriend (Eric) graduated with his master's in the spring, and his parents threw him a big party to celebrate. He's hoping to become a teacher and is currently working as a substitute. We've been dating for almost three years after meeting in college, but when I stumbled upon something that I bought to his attention, he made me out to be the enemy while accusing me of \"not being on his side\"\n\nEric is involved in a few role-play groups on Twitter, and he has a few accounts that portray various fictional characters. He's also into D&amp;D, but writing stories for his RP group to act out is his hobby, and while I'm not a part of the group, I followed some of the accounts to keep up with his storylines, and he sometimes asks me for opinions on his stories. However, I stumbled upon an account that I wasn't supposed to find, but did because some of his RP accounts followed it (as many of his accounts follow each other), and it was an account that impersonated one of his friends. Long story short... there's a guy named Evan who is in his D&amp;D group, and Evan is one of his closest friends. Evan also has a younger brother (Todd) who sometimes tags along to D&amp;D, and he is a talented artist who has drawn many of Eric's characters and profile photos for his RP accounts too. And while I'm not an active member of D&amp;D, I've met him a few times when I've tagged along on days when Eric would invite me\n\nEvan and Todd come from a military family where both of their parents served, but Evan went to college. Todd wanted to go into the service upon finishing high school, but Eric would try to convince him to go to college because he believed it was better than the service. However, Todd still wanted to enter. So, Eric spoke to Evan to try and get him on his side, but Evan reinforced that the choice was ultimately Todd's and that there are benefits to both the military and college. So, neither would be a bad choice, and I agreed with that too. However, when an injury would prevent Todd from being able to enter, Eric believed that he would opt for college, but he landed an internship through a connection with his father that would allow him to learn a trade instead, and that is what led to what happened recently\n\nEric made a Twitter that impersonated Todd, but unlike his RP accounts, he actually made it look like Todd's actual account and began using it to make fun of him. He downloaded photos of Todd and used them to make memes that degraded him for not going to college, some calling him \"stupid\" and \"how he got what he deserved\" by suffering the injury and not being able to enter, but he didn't stop there. He also downloaded photos from the accounts of family/relatives and began making fun of them for the internship he landed, posting photos of people who weren't Todd too. When I told him what I found and asked why he felt he could do this, he said that \"everyone sucks up to military families\" and that they're \"probably poor enough to get free college\" which is \"better than an internship\". When I pointed out a meme where he called Todd \"mentally re\\_\\_\\_\\_ted\", he said it was \"true\" because they were \"stupid to refuse college\" and \"think they're better than it\". When I told him that he has no right to berate Todd and a bunch of people related to him, he refused to take it down and said it's \"better than exploding in Todd's face\" when it really bothers him as someone who has a master's in teaching and wants everyone to know how important school is. But, when I told him that Todd is entitled to his own opinion, he accused me of \"taking Todd's side\" and \"not being sensitive of his ADHD\" and how he uses Twitter to vent when he's \"unable to focus\" which allows him to \"be more even keel in public\". When I asked if he had done this to anyone else besides Todd, he told me to \"mind my own business\" and refused to take it down. He also said that he had \"done this for a while\" and that only now I had an issue with it, and the account about Todd was a few weeks old\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter we talked that night, I planned to tell him that I wanted a break, but I didn't want to say it without preparing for him to potentially do the same to me on Twitter. So, after taking the advice of a lot of people, I decided to tell my family and relatives about how he had gone on a rampage of downloading photos of Todd's family/relatives and advised them to make their accounts private or block him, and a lot of them were really thankful that I told them. The main reason I did was because Eric downloaded photos of minors who were related to Todd, and I didn't want him doing the same to my family and making memes out of uninvolved people. I also spoke to Evan and told/showed him what had happened, and he was really upset and said that he and his parents were going to call the school Eric's interning/subbing at and let them know of what he's been doing not only to Todd, but also to minors in their family who he downloaded images of. He also said that he and his parents went to the police to address it, but as of writing, the account of Todd that Eric made is still somehow up and not yet deleted, and maybe it's because Eric made the account private after our initial conversation, but I don't know. I gave them all of my screenshots, but as of now, nothing has happened. Evan's parents also told/showed the school what happened, but he is still employed and subbing at the moment, and Evan said that they were having a hard time proving the account was Eric's although they are still trying to get it taken down. He also has relatives who are complaining to the school too about photos Eric downloaded of them and their children, but almost a month later, nothing has happened yet\n\nAfter talking to Evan and my family, I told Eric that we were done, but he began making posts about me on one of his RP accounts and how I was apparently \"cheating on him\" and \"trying to start rumors\", and I screenshotted what he posted, but still nothing has happened. He also started posting about some prescriptions I've taken that I never told anyone besides family, but my relatives have been supportive throughout. But, I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt. He's also started posting memes about me too, and I have record of all of it, and I'm hoping that with time and all of the people/relatives reporting that something can happen soon, but I'm slightly surprised nothing has happened yet. Lastly, I want to say that this whole thing has shown a side of him that I've never really seen before. Like, we've argued. But, stumbling across this account and what he \"uses to vent and cope with ADHD\" just made him so aggressive because he said that it was \"as if I was removing an inhaler from someone who needs it\" when we talked that night and he got so defensive. That's what he compared it too, me \"making fun of people with special needs\" as he's also posted about, and that's where I am now. I feel like I've done almost as much as I can, and waiting is hard. So, if anyone has any advice on how to push through this time with an ex who's trying to destroy everyone I know, I would really appreciate it. But, it's hard right now, and I'll end with this. He's also gone about posting images of me too, but nothing explicit as we've never taken those. However, he's started posting photos of me when I was in high school and in dance and making degrading comments about my body, and I've taken screenshots of those to the police too as I'm still waiting to see what happens. I've been told that it can be a process, but that has hurt the most and is what I'm trying to push through, and if anyone has any advice on how to just get past a toxic ex who goes to such measures, I would really appreciate it because right now is really hard. I'm hoping something happens soon, but maybe it's just a process, but I could just use all of the advice I could get\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: After our initial conversation where I confronted him on what I found, I wanted to break up, but not immediately until I got some things in order after many of the helpful comments from the first post, and I decided to warn family/relatives to block him or make their accounts private, but he's started posting about me in the same way he did to Todd",
    "human": "What a horrible person he is! You have an amazing amount of strength to be able to stand up to that nonsense! If I had kids, I would most certainly remove them from any class he may teach. Go to the school board with your information, they need to know ASAP. Perhaps the head of the department he got his masters degree from, too. They might revoke it.\n\nFunny though, how he equals college with knowledge and yet he is so lacking in it. He doesn’t understand that a degree is not life or death and there are many roads to knowledge. \n\nKeep it up!",
    "sft_reply": "decided to enlist anyway, and I found out that Todd and Eric are now in a romantic relationship. I know this because the impersonation account I stumbled upon shared a post about Todd being deployed to the Middle East, and I recognized the name from the times I met him\n\nEric's reaction was that I was being \"nosy\" and \"trying to ruin his life\" by bringing this up, and that I should've just stayed out of his business. He got very defensive and told me that I was being judgmental and that I didn't understand the context. He said that Todd and Evan are just friends, and that I should focus on our relationship instead of trying to dig up dirt on his friends\n\nI'm hurt and confused, and I'm not sure what to do. Should I just forget about it and move on, or should I talk to Eric again and try to clear the air?"
