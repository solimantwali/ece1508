"How to be happy with yourself Just to add, I'm not a person who lacks self-confidence, but as of recently I haven't been happy with myself. I find myself lacking drive and determination to do anything. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you","Happiness is created, NOT found.  Make it.  You can't wait until happiness falls on your lap, because you'll end up waiting forever.

If you lack drive and such, then find a goal, plan how to achieve that goal, and execute the plan.  Keep doing this, and soon you'll realize these small wins and achievements make you a better person, AND make you happier with yourself.

"TLDR: athiests: would you date someone who believes in god? If so what boundaries would you have especially regarding coparenting?


I am an atheist and want to ask other athiests: would you date someone who believes in god? Why or why not? If yes, would you have any boundaries on what is taught to your kids? (Assuming you want them)


For context I (29) went on a date with someone (33) and really clicked with them. It was just one date but they seem very connected (although not preachy or dogmatic) about their religion. I've never dated someone who believes in god, and don't want my kids growing up religious. Wondering if it's worth even trying to continue or if I should just give up now.",They would have to be a pretty amazing person for me to overlook their belief in imaginary people.
"How to stop being an emotional abuser My marriage is on the verge of ending, and I know it's my fault. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. 

Anyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck. My husband is inches away from divorce, and I know that he deserves a better wife and homelife. How do I stop? Especially since I didn't know I was doing it. 

Please help!","First step is responsibility. Remember that it doesn't matter that you didn't know you were doing it,  or how bad it makes you feel to be an abuser. Don't burden him by asking him to forgive you,  he has been through enough. 

He probably feels disrespected, unimportant, and unloved. Approach this by seeking a therapist (not a marriage therapist- one just for you, to overcome your problem) so he can see that you acknowledge his feelings, and also for your sake as a person. 

I would also advise to move to another room in the house to further reiterate you're serious about changing. Your mere presence probably makes him uneasy,  and this way he can have room to feel more like himself. It shows respect and consideration,  which is a form of love.

Throughout the process, remember he doesn't owe you anything. Not forgiveness, or even kindness. He's pissed off as hell- let him be. Be patient, be kind, listen well. Whenever you feel like you're about to take a step back in progress,  excuse yourself from the room to deal with your feelings. 

Good luck saving your marriage.

"What to do with a gf that doesn’t know what she wants to do
Basically, we wake up, we both want to do something. I name lots of different activities we could do and she can’t name 1 thing. What do I do?","She may be a person with a weak sense of self. She knows she wants to do stuff and have fun but doesn't know herself well enough to understand what excites her. People often talk about depression in relation to a lack of interest in activities and this is the part exactly that I believe causes it. 

If this sounds like her she needs to work on being present during activities and not in her head. Activities are never fun if you're in your head worrying over how you appear or contemplating what you'll do for the rest of your day. I made this mistake my entire life. The only thing that I could do to be present during an activity was play video games or read. I never considered why I liked those things I was just grateful I did like them and found relief when doing them. Now I understand it's because I gave them my undivided attention. Since focusing on that and putting forth the effort in other activities my interests have become endless."

My boyfriend (Eric) graduated with his master's in the spring, and his parents threw him a big party to celebrate. He's hoping to become a teacher and is currently working as a substitute. We've been dating for almost three years after meeting in college, but when I stumbled upon something that I bought to his attention, he made me out to be the enemy while accusing me of ""not being on his side""

Eric is involved in a few role-play groups on Twitter, and he has a few accounts that portray various fictional characters. He's also into D&amp;D, but writing stories for his RP group to act out is his hobby, and while I'm not a part of the group, I followed some of the accounts to keep up with his storylines, and he sometimes asks me for opinions on his stories. However, I stumbled upon an account that I wasn't supposed to find, but did because some of his RP accounts followed it (as many of his accounts follow each other), and it was an account that impersonated one of his friends. Long story short... there's a guy named Evan who is in his D&amp;D group, and Evan is one of his closest friends. Evan also has a younger brother (Todd) who sometimes tags along to D&amp;D, and he is a talented artist who has drawn many of Eric's characters and profile photos for his RP accounts too. And while I'm not an active member of D&amp;D, I've met him a few times when I've tagged along on days when Eric would invite me

Evan and Todd come from a military family where both of their parents served, but Evan went to college. Todd wanted to go into the service upon finishing high school, but Eric would try to convince him to go to college because he believed it was better than the service. However, Todd still wanted to enter. So, Eric spoke to Evan to try and get him on his side, but Evan reinforced that the choice was ultimately Todd's and that there are benefits to both the military and college. So, neither would be a bad choice, and I agreed with that too. However, when an injury would prevent Todd from being able to enter, Eric believed that he would opt for college, but he landed an internship through a connection with his father that would allow him to learn a trade instead, and that is what led to what happened recently

Eric made a Twitter that impersonated Todd, but unlike his RP accounts, he actually made it look like Todd's actual account and began using it to make fun of him. He downloaded photos of Todd and used them to make memes that degraded him for not going to college, some calling him ""stupid"" and ""how he got what he deserved"" by suffering the injury and not being able to enter, but he didn't stop there. He also downloaded photos from the accounts of family/relatives and began making fun of them for the internship he landed, posting photos of people who weren't Todd too. When I told him what I found and asked why he felt he could do this, he said that ""everyone sucks up to military families"" and that they're ""probably poor enough to get free college"" which is ""better than an internship"". When I pointed out a meme where he called Todd ""mentally re\_\_\_\_ted"", he said it was ""true"" because they were ""stupid to refuse college"" and ""think they're better than it"". When I told him that he has no right to berate Todd and a bunch of people related to him, he refused to take it down and said it's ""better than exploding in Todd's face"" when it really bothers him as someone who has a master's in teaching and wants everyone to know how important school is. But, when I told him that Todd is entitled to his own opinion, he accused me of ""taking Todd's side"" and ""not being sensitive of his ADHD"" and how he uses Twitter to vent when he's ""unable to focus"" which allows him to ""be more even keel in public"". When I asked if he had done this to anyone else besides Todd, he told me to ""mind my own business"" and refused to take it down. He also said that he had ""done this for a while"" and that only now I had an issue with it, and the account about Todd was a few weeks old

Update:

After we talked that night, I planned to tell him that I wanted a break, but I didn't want to say it without preparing for him to potentially do the same to me on Twitter. So, after taking the advice of a lot of people, I decided to tell my family and relatives about how he had gone on a rampage of downloading photos of Todd's family/relatives and advised them to make their accounts private or block him, and a lot of them were really thankful that I told them. The main reason I did was because Eric downloaded photos of minors who were related to Todd, and I didn't want him doing the same to my family and making memes out of uninvolved people. I also spoke to Evan and told/showed him what had happened, and he was really upset and said that he and his parents were going to call the school Eric's interning/subbing at and let them know of what he's been doing not only to Todd, but also to minors in their family who he downloaded images of. He also said that he and his parents went to the police to address it, but as of writing, the account of Todd that Eric made is still somehow up and not yet deleted, and maybe it's because Eric made the account private after our initial conversation, but I don't know. I gave them all of my screenshots, but as of now, nothing has happened. Evan's parents also told/showed the school what happened, but he is still employed and subbing at the moment, and Evan said that they were having a hard time proving the account was Eric's although they are still trying to get it taken down. He also has relatives who are complaining to the school too about photos Eric downloaded of them and their children, but almost a month later, nothing has happened yet

After talking to Evan and my family, I told Eric that we were done, but he began making posts about me on one of his RP accounts and how I was apparently ""cheating on him"" and ""trying to start rumors"", and I screenshotted what he posted, but still nothing has happened. He also started posting about some prescriptions I've taken that I never told anyone besides family, but my relatives have been supportive throughout. But, I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt. He's also started posting memes about me too, and I have record of all of it, and I'm hoping that with time and all of the people/relatives reporting that something can happen soon, but I'm slightly surprised nothing has happened yet. Lastly, I want to say that this whole thing has shown a side of him that I've never really seen before. Like, we've argued. But, stumbling across this account and what he ""uses to vent and cope with ADHD"" just made him so aggressive because he said that it was ""as if I was removing an inhaler from someone who needs it"" when we talked that night and he got so defensive. That's what he compared it too, me ""making fun of people with special needs"" as he's also posted about, and that's where I am now. I feel like I've done almost as much as I can, and waiting is hard. So, if anyone has any advice on how to push through this time with an ex who's trying to destroy everyone I know, I would really appreciate it. But, it's hard right now, and I'll end with this. He's also gone about posting images of me too, but nothing explicit as we've never taken those. However, he's started posting photos of me when I was in high school and in dance and making degrading comments about my body, and I've taken screenshots of those to the police too as I'm still waiting to see what happens. I've been told that it can be a process, but that has hurt the most and is what I'm trying to push through, and if anyone has any advice on how to just get past a toxic ex who goes to such measures, I would really appreciate it because right now is really hard. I'm hoping something happens soon, but maybe it's just a process, but I could just use all of the advice I could get

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: After our initial conversation where I confronted him on what I found, I wanted to break up, but not immediately until I got some things in order after many of the helpful comments from the first post, and I decided to warn family/relatives to block him or make their accounts private, but he's started posting about me in the same way he did to Todd","What a horrible person he is! You have an amazing amount of strength to be able to stand up to that nonsense! If I had kids, I would most certainly remove them from any class he may teach. Go to the school board with your information, they need to know ASAP. Perhaps the head of the department he got his masters degree from, too. They might revoke it.

Funny though, how he equals college with knowledge and yet he is so lacking in it. He doesn’t understand that a degree is not life or death and there are many roads to knowledge. 

Keep it up!"
"I've (25F) been dating my partner (26M) for around 9 months. He has been my first romantic relationship.

We've  been having conversations around sex for a couple of weeks, he seemed  very keen and like he was looking forward to it. I've been initiating  the discussions, because I asked him to take it slow, and I grew up in a  not very physically affectionate household, and it's been a learning  experience to allow myself to enjoy romantic attention in that way. But  we talked about how we have a similar view of sex, not interested in  casual sex and wanting emotional connection as a key part of it, which  we both felt like we had and were ready for sex.

So  yesterday we were hanging out and he told me that he was very attracted  to me in that moment and had an erection, and so I asked him if he  wanted to go to the bedroom, and he said yes, but didn't move. So I  checked in, and told him we didn't have to have sex if he didn't want  to, but he said he did. Before we had sex, I opened up and told him it  was my first time, and that I wanted him to take it slow and him take  the lead a bit. We started having sex, and he was silent with no  checking of consent, quite rough, and not as caring or affectionate as I  would have hoped, even when I tried to tell him what I liked, he didn't  listen, and it just felt really mechanical.

As  soon as he was done, his head hit the pillow and he said ""Oh, here's  something I haven't mentioned yet, I'm asexual I think, but I really  don't know for sure"". This shocked me because he specifically told me he  wasn't, he just preferred sex in relationships and with partners. I  asked him about it a little more, and he said ""I could go our whole  relationship without having sex, I don't really like it or care about it, and my maximum amount of sex would be once every week or even every  fortnight, because I know you want it"".

I said to him that my minimum was at least once a week, and I thought  that this was a pretty significant issue that we'd need to talk about  more, because I don't want to feel like I'm forcing him to have sex for  my sake. He then asked me how I felt if ""we never had sex at all?"", and  ""how would you have felt if we didn't have sex tonight?"". I said I was  looking forward to it, but of course he could say no at any time, and he  seemed to understand, but said he didn't really know what he wanted.

But  I went home and started thinking about the conversation, feeling like he wasn't 100% truthful in giving consent that he wanted sex, especially now knowing he is asexual, and him trying to gauge if he would have  ruined things by saying no. So I called him today, basically saying that  I was upset that he withheld his asexuality identity before sex, when I  had opened up a vulnerable dialogue right before telling him that I was  a virgin, and that he didn't give me the opportunity to make up my mind  to have sex with someone that didn't really care whether it happened or  not.

I asked him point blank did  he really want to have sex with me, and he said ""yes"", and I called him  out on the mixed messages, and asked him again to be 100% truthful,  when he finally said, ""No, I didn't want to have sex with you"". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that my first experience wasn't consensual and he didn't want to be there, and I don't know how to process or handle this.

I  basically told him I needed space to think and process this experience,  and that he needed to go and think about what he actually wants,  whether he sees any sex life with me at all, and how he can communicate  clearly about when he wants it or when he doesn't. But I feel like  there's been a huge violation of trust, and I don't know if I can trust him to give me genuine consent, or if he's giving me consent to keep the  peace.

I guess I'm wondering  whether this relationship is salvageable, and how other people manage  being in a relationship with an asexual partner and a partner with a high libido?

TL;DR - My boyfriend admitted that he was asexual after taking my virginity, told me he doesn't like sex, and didn't even want to have sex with me and he lied and told me that he did.

Thank you for your advice, I'm really hurt and confused and struggling to think straight!","The issue is much more strongly a lack of honest communication from one side of the relationship. How can you trust in the future what he's telling you about sex if he wasn't honest this time? So even if you're able to make an arrangement based on your needs and his supposed asexuality, can you believe and trust that it is a true, consensual, thought out communicated position. Your relationship has trust issues because he did not treat communication properly."
"I didn’t take my placebo pill during my period and didn’t tell my BF. I understand he’s angry and I should have been more considerate but there are many more factors that should have weighed into his feelings.
1. We have been together almost 9 years. Of those 9 years, I have never had a pregnancy scary, have always either taken pills or had an IUD AND my BF still wears condoms most times we do have sex. 

2. I did not take my placebo pill during a week I was already on my period. We are not usually sexually active during my period.  And were not this time. 

3. DIRECTLY after the week of placebo pills of this pack, I got an IUD inserted. 

4. BF still uses a condom almost every time. 

Now he’s incredibly upset with me and telling me he could never trust me again. I’m not sure what to tell him. I understand he’s upset but given all these added factors, I don’t think this should be relationship ending. Am I wrong?

ETA for context: we actually already had this fight about a month ago and we agreed it was his right to know about my birth control decisions. HOWEVER. The placebo is the placebo. I know it does nothing whether I took it or not. What he’s upset about is my decision to not take it without telling him. What I don’t understand is why this is such a big deal given all the previous factors AND it being a placebo pill.","Do you both realize the placebo pill is literally *a placebo*? It doesn't have any medication, it's just there to keep you in the habit of taking a pill every day while you have your period. It doesn't change anything. It does nothing."
"My (25F) previously abusive dad (59M) is in therapy and better, but I can’t get over the past and don’t want to forgive him.

My dad was abusive to me as a child and teenager, although I didn’t realize it then. He would oscillate between extremely sweet in an overbearing way, calling me pet names and using a sweet voice, lots of hugging etc. to blowing up at a moment’s notice. I never knew when it was going to happen or what would cause it. When I was a preteen / teen it might be a “tone” I had in my voice, he would scream and swear at me and call me a fucking brat until I cried. When I was a little kid (3 or 4) I once called 9-1-1 on a dare from my sister. It didn’t even ring, I hung up out of fear, he found out and came in and screamed at me at the top of his lungs and I cried the entire day. He would threaten to hit me sometimes but never did, although I did get spanked as a child. One time when I was 3 or so I cut a little piece of my sister’s hair off (she told me to) and he screamed and threatened to “shave my whole fucking head” etc. He was alcoholic for a while during the recession and picked us up from school events while drinking in the car. My sister threatened to tell and he yelled at us and told us not to “throw him under the bus”.

Then when he was nice again he would touch my arm or something and I’d recoil, and he’d ask what was wrong with me, I was his daughter, he had a right and so on. He said he loved me and wanted to spend time with me but because I was afraid of him snapping I’d hide in my room and lock the door. He’d threaten to take the door off the hinges (he didn’t, but he would angrily shake it and bang on it if he saw it was locked). Lots of other stuff too, like him insulting and screaming at me for not believing everything he did (he thinks global warming is a hoax, voted for Trump, is racist and homophobic), he was drunk and high on my birthdays, but I could just keep going on.

I went back for Christmas this year mostly out of guilt and for the first time ever he was strangely fine. No screaming, no insults, no excessive drinking, and he didn’t bring up politics. No guilt tripping when I didn’t want him touching me. He’s been in therapy and is working on himself. I’m happy he’s better, but I still am really suspicious and I can’t forgive everything he’s done. He’s never made those apologies himself or brought up how he treated us. He thinks he was the “best dad ever” and that’s why my sister and I got straight As and went to amazing schools (it was because we worked our asses off to get out of their house.) I succeeded with no thanks to my parents. They try to make me feel indebted because they “fed me and put a roof over my head” when there are “children in Africa dying.” I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive my dad (or my mom for enabling him - she’s not a good person either). I think he’s a narcissist and while I’m really shocked the therapy seems to be working, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him and I’m not sure if I want to. I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive him. I never really sat down and told him everything I feel and think, but I don’t want to. I feel like I shouldn’t have to - it’s very clear he was not good to me or my sister. I’m low contact but also considering going no contact because I feel it would relieve a burden for me. Should I want to try? Just looking for advice on how to navigate my feelings here.

TLDR; my dad was abusive in the past and is in therapy and has been better for several months, but I don’t want to forgive him, and am considering going no contact.

EDIT: Since a lot of people are asking - I have been in therapy in the past and am looking for a new therapist now due to coverage changes. It helped me work through trauma to an extent, but I’m definitely still dealing with it. I just wanted to get this out here anyway. Thanks for your support everyone :)","You don't owe your dad forgiveness, and even if you do forgive, it may take a long time.  But you don't owe it, and it's ok if you don't.

If he ever asks or pressures you, point out that negating the trauma from your entire childhood will take a long time, and he can't expect ""a connection"" to be instantaneous.   

Then feel free to keep your distance."
"My [30sF] neighbor is a young man in his early 20s. He is autistic, quite high-functioning. Lives with his dad and I believe his grandma and siblings. Sweet guy, knowledgeable on lots of subjects. He is very talkative, so it's often difficult to exit a conversation when I need to, but overall he's a pleasant guy who really enjoys socializing. I have learned the best ways to set conversational boundaries kindly but clearly, and we get along fine.

I am a very introverted person. I need a LOT of quiet time to stay sane. I am a stay-at-home parent (we have a 3-year-old) so quiet and solitude is a blessed rarity around our house.

In the warmer months, we (my husband [30sM], our son, and myself) spend a ton of time in our yard, which I consider our second living room in the spring and summer. It's where we eat, play, and where I do my gardening, which is my one big hobby/passion. Pretty much every time our neighbor hears me hanging out in the yard with my son, he comes over and knocks on the gate. I have let him in to have a short visit a handful of times, and it was fine. 

But after several instances, I found that it was causing me a lot of stress and exhaustion to navigate these visits because A) I had not been expecting to socialize, so half the time I'm in jammies or my son is naked or I'm just plain grumpy because life is busy and tiring; B) I was trying to get things done in my yard, and I'm itching to get back to the task I was focused on; C) I have to also keep one eye on my demanding toddler the whole time, which can already be very draining even without having to socialize simultaneously; D) I was experiencing anxiety going outside because I expecting him to knock at any moment for a nice long chat; E) sometimes we are having a visit with my immediate family or close friends, and we want to spend time with just them; and F) I have to be quite vigilant because I've noticed neighbor does not have a sense of appropriate physical boundaries with my son, who is very friendly and physically affectionate with pretty much everybody. Wants to pick him up like a baby, lets him hug and kiss him and climb all over his lap, etc. He doesn't mean any harm but it's still just an additional thing I need to think about when he's over.

So I stopped letting him in and just stood at the gate for quick neighborly chats when he would come by. He makes it clear he wants to come inside the yard, but I always have a reason to keep the visit short and light. I say things like, ""We're having some family time/we're eating dinner/we're not feeling great today/we're really busy getting stuff done, so we'll see you another day, but thanks for stopping by!"" But he will come over the next day to see if it's a good time, or he will ask if we can schedule a visit. He will also text me frequently, although I usually do not respond, except on holidays to return well wishes.

I feel un-neighborly saying it, but at the root of all this is that I'm just not interested, or even mentally able, to socialize with an acquaintance this often. I don't even socialize with my own parents this much, and they live two blocks away. My quiet time, privacy, and calm/happy outdoor time with my family are sacred. I have not explained this at length to my neighbor, because I'm not sure how to state it without hurting his feelings. But if I'm completely honest, we do not have anything in common and I am just not interested in having a social relationship with him except occasionally saying hello in passing, like I do with our other neighbors.

My goal, put frankly, is for him to never knock on our gate at all. For me, it is the equivalent of him knocking on my front door for a visit. I feel like I sound like a horrible callous person for wanting him out of my life, but it's just how I feel and it's the boundary I need. I also can't stand it when people drop by unexpectedly, even people I know really well.

I'm looking for advice on what to say that will reach him, since he simply doesn't understand social cues. I like him, I think he's perfectly friendly, and I do not want him to feel badly, because I think it's wonderful that he gets himself out there and socializes. I know he makes the rounds every day with several houses (and I also know another family we're friendly with, his neighbor on the other side, is experiencing the same discomfort that we are). If we have parties where neighbors are invited, he is included. But that is the extent of my desired relationship with him. How can I tell someone, clearly and explicitly but without hurting their feelings, that I don't want them knocking on my door?

TL;DR My [30sF] autistic neighbor [20sM] knocks on my gate for a long chat every time we are outside, several times a week in nice weather, and as an introvert, it is exhausting me. How to set boundaries kindly but firmly?","As an autistic person, just tell him. Literally. Say it. 

“Hey, we love you coming around when you come for parties and what not, but we don’t like when you just turn up without a direct invitation. Can you not do that anymore?”"
"how to discipline your mind and keep it that way. Someone posted on Reddit a while back, I'm sure it was on r/getmotivated saying ""discipline is better than motivation because motivation is fleeting where as discipline is not"" or something very close to that. The quote inspired me to discipline my mind but after a while even that faded. How would I keep this mind set?","Pick an activity that you do not enjoy doing (like reading or pushups).

Now, make a concentrated effort to do it at least once a day.

What this does is that it gets your brain in the habit of doing things that are dis-pleasurable, but necessary. It also makes THAT thing the low-point of your day, which makes everything else easier."
"I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (41M) for 3 years. I am very self conscious and not ready to have sex. It's not that I'm waiting for marriage or anything, but I want to wait until I feel ready. I also come from a religious family, and while I am now atheist, I think my religious upbringing makes me very heistant to do anything sexual. 

Anyway, about 6 months ago, he said that he wanted to start having sex before our 3rd anniversary, and if that didn't happen, he would ""reconsider"" our relationship. I didn't feel ready to have sex yet so I didn't. He asked if I was ready a couple of times but I said no and he didn't push the matter.  We celebrated our 3rd anniversary by going to a concert and dinner and drinks.  Then about 2 weeks later, he broke up with me and I was totally devastated. I literally cried for like 2 days nonstop. I had to spend the night in my mom's room for comfort because I was too sad to stay all alone in my room.  

I know this might all sound silly, but do you all think I acted inappropriately. The reason I'm posting is  because my friends said that when you're dating someone seriously you're expected to have sex, otherwise you're just friends and not really in a relationship. I also feel like he lied to me because when we first started dating I explained to him that I wasn't comfortable with sex yet and he said that he was willing to wait until I was ready, but he clearly wasn't. 

---
tl;dr: My boyfriend dumped me because of lack of sex, after a 6 month ultimatum.","There is likely more to the story here. First off, a 20 year old dating a 38 year old is a big red flag, I'm sure it works out for some, but they are definitely the smallest percentage.

You wanted him to wait, he did wait for 3 years. He is perfectly fine for leaving instead of pressing you. There is a major incompatibility here. Also, have you considered therapy to help understand your concerns about sex?"
"How to stop caring what others may think of you? I realize, that other people don't care and won't even remember that awkward thing I said 10 minutes ago, but I keep subconsciously assuming that they do. In other words, how to gain control over that feeling?","Whenever you doubt that people have forgotten the awkward thing you said 10 minutes ago, consider the fact that you don't remember the awkward thing they said 10 minutes ago.  Why is that?  Are you a superior person who doesn't judge, but surrounded by people who do?  Or are you an ordinary person with some insecurity surrounded by people who are just like you?

If that logic doesn't convince you then test it.  Ask someone about the thing you said or did that is nagging at you and see if they remember, and if they do, see if they give two shits about it.  In almost all cases they won't. 


Also ask yourself why this feeling is so common.  As I read elsewhere, we all compare our blooper reel to everyone else's highlight reel."
"My fiancee and I go through difficult times. We try to get pregnant, we try to find an affordable house, we try to manage our stressful full time jobs, and keep our chaotic families at bay. Yesterday we had a very lovely Sunday (went to a lake, enjoyed ourselves, had some ice cream) until in the evening she did a test and found out that she's again not pregnant. She was devastated. I tried to comfort her, listen, take care of her. But she began to push me away, first with comments like ""you don't care"", then physically. She said that she regrets not pressuring me into having a baby 5 years ago (and finding a house, and more). Then we argued about whether she blames me for our problems (which we often do, and which she never directly answers). We do that often, but I tried hard not to defend myself and still just be there for her. 

When we went to bed I tried to comfort her again, but she again pushed me away and even said ""leave me alone"". So I retreated back to my side of the bed, and eventually slept away.

This morning, she began accusing me of exactly that: I would not care, I would keep my distance, turn around and just go to sleep.

I don't know how to handle this situation. I get it when someone says s/he needs distance. Even her friends told me to keep distance and let her breath. But every time I do that, she gets even more furious. How do you comfort someone who tells you with both words and body language that she does not want to be comforted; but later on accuses you of not being there for her?

TL;DR: every time my girlfriend is sad I try to comfort her, but then she pushes me away, so I keep my distance. Some time later she blames me for exactly that behaviour of keeping my distance. How does one handle this?","So I am sometimes guilty of this myself: pushing my partner away (or anyone really) and then when they do give me space, it validates my irrational belief that they don't want me around. 

And I realised that I was seeking validation but I wasn't willing to accept it because I didn't feel that I deserved it. 

Tell your partner that you love her, that you are there for her, and all she needs to do is ask you. Be it verbally, or non-verbally. But also tell her that you can't read her mind and that she needs to be straight with you about what she needs.

Best of luck OP. Hope you both get through these trying times together."

"Introverted black single mom with no friends
I'm 27F and very lonely. I have a 9 month old son and my ex has gone no contact and disappeared. My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.

I live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)

I think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.

Thanks for any advice. I will not add anyone on other platforms for any reason.","If you're looking for friends and your local area is very religious and judgmental about your situation, then have you considered saving up some money and moving away to another city with more open-minded people? I knwo you need family right now to help you watch your baby, but in the long run if you want friends for your own mental health, then either moving to another city or trying again to reach out to others in your local community may be the only options.

Still, take care of yourself and your baby for now, and save up! Good luck and take care."
"Personal Items and Roller coaster rides. So tomorrow I'll be visiting a theme park with a friend of mine(we're minors). We will be in contact with our parents for obvious reasons. However, I have come across the dilemma of what to do with our phones when we ride the coasters. Since I may need to contact my parents at any time, storing it in a locker seems out of the question. I would put it under a sweatshirt in a cubby the park provides for personal items, but I don't want to take that risk with my phone.

"Quitting something you feel obligated to keep doing?

How can you convince yourself to quit?

In my case, I've spent a ton of time and money on World of Warcraft and I feel like that money would have been a waste if I don't play the crap out of this game. I feel obligated to play it, but video games are meant to be played for fun.

"How to Not Be Overbearing During a Debate/Argument I was raised by a hard-headed O'Reilly-esque father who believed in Victory by Volume, so I know how frustrating it is to argue/debate with someone like that, but yet I can't seem to help myself from doing the exact same thing. 

As soon as I become impassioned about a subject I lower the pitch of my voice and turn up the volume and speed, making it nearly impossible for other people to get a word in. Then I convince myself that I must finish my train of thought if I'm going to convince anyone of my position, which causes me to spew out 100 smaller arguments within the context of a larger idea (this technique is known as the [Gish Gallop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)). Online it's not so bad b/c people can reread and quote what I've said, but IRL it makes it impossible for others to get a word in or have a constructive dialog. 

I hate that I do this and I'm looking for techniques to stop myself. 

Whatcha got, Reddit?","Most importantly: know the purpose and the structure of an effective debate.  If your debate fails either one of these, it is not effective, and you should back away.

The purpose of a debate is to argue a subjective opinion built upon objective facts to convince others your opinion is correct.  If you try to argue a point whose only supporting evidence is other opinions you have, you should have a discussion instead, which is where you just discuss opinions in a relaxed manner.

The structure of a debate is ""point, counter-point, rebuttal"".  State a single, specific opinion you have, then state some facts that surround it.  Limit each fact to 30 seconds or so, and do not bring up multiple facts at once.  Then, let your opponent respond to that fact.  Then you can discuss your opponent's response, and segue onto the next fact.

Breathe.  Taking a deep breath is the best general advice I can give you.  It punctuates your speech, calms you down, lets you gather your thoughts, and allows your opponent time to respond.

Recognize your audience.  You are almost never trying to convince the person you are debating with that you are right; you are convincing some third party, such as people listening to the discussion that you are right.

Prepare your points.  It is fine if to prove your point you must first say 100 other things, but you have to space them out, let people examine and question each one either individually or in small sets, and let them soak in.  If you find yourself speaking until you are out of breath, make sure you take a nice long inhale, and then let your opponent speak about that.

Remain calm and collected.  If you get angry or even seem that way, people are less inclined to side with you.  Speak level and slowly by practicing your breathing and not getting excited.  If you hear your voice raising, take a deep breath.

Finally, recognize when a debate is futile.  If you are not getting anywhere, the other person is yelling, or they just aren't understanding what you are saying, sometimes it is best to just realize the person is not going to get it and to walk away or change the subject."

"She's a friend of my boyfriend from university. I met her once at my boyfriend‘s birthday party a year ago. They were having fun remembering the evenings the two of them spent together drinking wine.

A couple of weeks later he told me he would be meeting up with her to have a few glasses of wine again.  
I then asked him how he knew her and if there was ever anything between them. He just said 'No, but she would be pretty... she's always been in relationships though.‘ That was the end of the conversation.  
He apparently didn't end up seeing her because he was too busy. He never mentioned her again for a whole year.

Last week I asked my boyfriend if she would come to his birthday party this summer again and if he ever saw her over the year since he never mentioned her. He reluctantly admitted 'Yes, I might have seen her once or so'. I kept on asking and then it turned out he drove over an hour to spend the evening with her at her parents' house a couple of months ago. I wanted to know why he didn't tell me about it (we ask how each others day went everyday!) and he was just ''I probably just forgot to tell you or I didn't want to make you worry, I don't know"" ""You're making a big deal out of nothing."" ''Am I not allowed to have pretty female friends'' ""You're being extremely jealous'', “You‘re overreacting“,...  

Apart from that, she also came to his parents restaurant with her family twice or so over the year and probably saw him as well. At least he did end up saying (completely annoyed though):'I will deliberately tell you beforehand when I see her in the future'. The next time we had a conversation about this he wanted to reassure me their friendship is purely platonic.

Anyways, I used to feel like I can trust my boyfriend 100%, and now I am constantly worried. Around that month that he met up with her I had this weird gut feeling that he has met someone else or that I can't trust him anymore... I've talked to him about his female friend three times after finding out but I still don't feel better. I would like for the relationship to work and I want to trust him, but I don't know how to go about this. What can I do to be able to trust him again fully?  


TL;DR : She's an old friend of my boyfriend who he has spent a lot of evenings drinking wine with. I met her once at a party and I asked who she was. He said she's and old friend, nothing ever happened between them but that she would be pretty and that she’s always been in relationships. He never mentioned her again for a whole year. I asked him about her a week ago and it turned out that he drove over an hour to see her for an evening at  her parents house a couple of months ago. We talk about our day everyday and he didn't mention seeing her. When I told him that it bothered me that he wasn't honest he told me I'm overreacting. I want our relationship to work but I can't fully trust him anymore.


Edit: Should I tell him I sometimes feel so bad about it it‘s making me consider leaving the relationship?
Edit Edit: I used to feel really secure in the relationship because I was his first ever girlfriend and the first girl he ever introduced to his family (even though I am sure he had other options) and he made me feel really special. 

Edit Edit Edit: I’m currently at my boyfriend’s place and skimmed through their messages... He met up with her in March. She messaged him at 1:30am „Did you get home safely“, he was like „Yes, everything went well“ and she wrote „I had a really nice time with you😊“. He then messaged her about once a month asking her how she‘s doing and inviting her to his events or asking if she wants to meet up but she always cancelled...

"How do I start all over again? I'm facing struggles about my self and academics. I'm currently a college student but I had to stop because of some issues.

During the first semester in college I was doing fine, just like how a normal student would. I was self studying, attending classes, doing homework and all requirements in class. Then the first semester finals came, there were a lot of projects that was needed to be done, some of them are group projects but I did almost all of it alone. Some of my friends needed my help with their projects and I kindly helped all of them. It was very tiring and stressful, as far as I can remember it was the first and most stressful weeks of my academic life but despite all of the struggles I managed to survive the first semester.

The second semester started, two to three weeks in I was still doing fine but eventually I became less inspired as day goes by. I slowly stopped doing homework, I stopped attending classes, I feel very drained. Those days of not attending classes became a month, I just stopped doing anything. Every time I try to do some school related stuff all of a sudden I feel sleepy, out of energy and uninterested. I just started avoiding everything that is school related. I had one friend that I talk to often but when he messages me about academics I just ignore his messages, when I feel like his message is gonna be related to academics I immediately stop reading it and not talk to him. I decided to take a rest and quit college but I plan to go back next school year.

I want to catch up and start studying again, but I still feel the same uninspired feeling whenever I try to start again. I don't really know how to overcome this feeling and start all over again. What should I do?

"I{F24} told my boyfriend{27} in April that he needs to stop talking completely to his ex, as it's a dealbreaker for me. It's either me or her. He said he will stop.

Now recently, I was on my bf's iPad drawing and wanted to send the art to myself. Clicked to share and his ex-gf popped up. I asked him if they have been talking, he said no. Then I asked several more times and he said ""no no no"". He then showed me their chat to prove which had no messages. I could tell that he was lying so I asked him again and then he eventually admitted that he only talked to her once, that it was innocent and he deleted it because he didn't want me to overthink it.

Then I had a ""crazy fit"" and told him to prove it to me. He basically ended up asking his ex for the screenshots. Yeah nothing bad, but apparently he's been texting replying to her messages since when I asked him to stop.I think this is very embarrassing.

"Update +2yrs: How to find disabled mother's SSN to help secure her vital documents? So two years ago I made this [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/hvxswl/ulpt_request_how_to_find_homeless_disabled/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Some short background:&gt; in 2020 I was on a small crusade to acquire my mother's (63F) vital documents because she had been homeless since 2009 (almost the same as me except I was a minor at the time (I'm 22M now)). Shes had everything stolen from her, during this decade, at least ten times.

Eventually a mentally ill person whose no longer in town did assault her (pipe related head trauma), and as such she recovered from that perfectly fine. But she suspects that her following subsiquent stroke a few months later in October of 2019 was related to it. 

She eventually recovered really well from it and regained her previous rate of mobility and cognitive function. But it was time I found a place for her to live safely with access to a bathroom, food, shower, and exercise that didn't involve running from corrupt cops at 3am.

The Update: I asked for help on this sub and I def received it, so I wanted to update. She made it to a facility. A redditor was able to help me, through various means, to get a partial number. From that I was able to match it with information my mom's reclusive ex boyfriend from the 80s gave me.

Apparently they traded SSNs on the back of a photograph (ahh boomers (not in a bad way in this context). After another series of unfortunate events a case worker from the medical field was able to sort it all out, I was able to secure the documents I needed.

She's been safe and sound in an assisted living facility since mid 2021. Besides falling once (she lost ballance and sat down on the floor from standing height (shes a heavy white woman so shes cushioned)) they discovered she has COPD and a few other things but otherwise MISSION ACCONPLISHED.

(20F) I'm new to drinking. I don't have much friends and I'm very socially awkward. But I am brave enough to go out and try new things. I havent experienced a relationship yet and it's not like I'm desperate or whatever but I'd like to know how to behave in such an environment alone. The last time I went to a bar, it was really crowded and I was in a corner by myself not knowing what to do. I think I'm okay looking but I feel like guys my age want nothing to do with me as every guy that walked in didn't even throw a glance my way lol. I just need some advice.","Going to the bar with the specific intention of meeting someone special is almost always disappointing.

Going to the bar to without reservations and have conversations is much more rewarding.  I go to the bar TO TALK to other people that don't work with me or live in my house.   There are dozens of people I talk to at our local bar.  There are several friendship groups that occasionally invite me to stuff because I know them through the bar.

This is difficult for introverted people.  Not only do you have to put yourself out there, some people won't always like you or want to talk to you.   That's life.   Its also difficult if nobody is up there.  If no one is there, I have just one or two and chat with the bartender (all of whom I know.)   This is more difficult in packed clubs with a hundred people.

Every serious relationship I've ever had happened when I wasn't ""trying"" to meet someone.  Its almost like trying too hard messes everything up.   Just be yourself and be open to making friends and talking to other people.  The rest will happen eventually"

"How to think outside the box and actually contribute in a corporate job. I'm a software developer, and I'm really good at taking requirements and making them ""come to life"". However, where I feel like I lack the most is my ability to think outside the box and come up with cool solutions to things or new ideas that will actually make a difference.

Example: I was invited to a 2016 planning meeting, and literally had no idea where to even start. I always question whether my ideas will be laughed at or will even be good enough for the business to be taken seriously, and that lack of confidence prevents me from speaking up.

Whenever I'm in a meeting, I always hold back on spewing ideas (again, due to lack of confidence). Generally someone else will voice a similar idea and get solid recognition. I then decide to speak up and voice other ideas which don't get the same reactions and are mostly ignored. This bothers me so much - the fact that I hold back on saying ideas that people will like, and end up letting someone else take the spotlight. It almost feels like people hate on my ideas just because, even though I'm sure that's not the case.

"My bf (37) and I (39) have been together nearly 9 months.  We’ve had an amazing honeymoon phase, traveling &amp; doing things we love together etc.  We have great intimacy/connection and a lot in common.  We’ve talked about a future, living together, getting married etc. 
Sadly I’ve been noticing a pattern of possible disrespect on his part, although he seems clueless that these things would hurt me so it’s not intentional.  There have been a few red flags but the most recent one is what’s making me wonder if there isn’t a future for us.  

He has an ex gf that is a super hot Rockette dancer in NY. and they’re still friendly.  We stayed at her apt. in NY once for a weekend without my knowledge (she rents it out when she travels).  I expressed very clearly that I was uncomfortable with that at the time &amp; didn’t want to sleep in her bed, he said he didn’t consider that &amp; was sorry. 

This past week, he told me his family will be visiting NY from down south and he reached out to her to meet his family and take them on a tour behind the scenes of the Rockette show.  He didn’t invite me nor ask if I wanted to plan on  seeing them when they visit.  But he’s making plans for his ex Rockette gf to hang out with them and take pictures together? 

I was angry and jealous and communicated that I felt it was inappropriate and awkward for me but again, he didn’t understand why.  He said sorry again &amp; didn’t consider it would bother me.  He asked if I wanted him to stop talking to her but I don’t want to be controlling or put in that position so of course I said no.  

I’m battling between if this is my issue with insecurity &amp; jealously or if he was wrong and is disrespecting me.  My friends all seem to be just as, if not more upset than I am about it but they’re biased.  I want to see it from all sides. 

TL;DR: Bf reached out to hot ex gf Rockette to meet his visiting family &amp; give them a tour when he made no plans with me to see them.","From what you've described, I kinda get a selfish vibe from your BF if it has anything to do with the ex. He's being insensitive to your feelings concerning her, and I almost think (because it is total speculation) that he wanted you to say you didn't want him to see her anymore. That way, you are the bad guy. If it was an honest offer, he would've stated that he won't see her because he knows it makes you uncomfortable instead of putting it on you to make a decision. There are unresolved feelings between them that need to be addressed until you and he can move forward. I am sorry you're going through this. It sucks."

Would it be a good idea to have a one month rolling contract (£13) until a new Phone comes out worth having - also meaning that if Apple for example release another in a year's time, I'll be at the end of my contract and be able to get it straight away.

"I could use some advice on a situation I’m in with a girl I’m seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I live on the west coast and ended up meeting a girl and going on a date with her. I’ve been on many dates and within 15 minutes I knew this one was special. We connected and vibed incredibly well and ended up spending the night and morning/afternoon together before I had to fly out. By the end, we were talking about not knowing how to go back to our normal lives after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

We didn’t talk for a few weeks, but I eventually reached out and we had a proper phone call for 2 hours that re-ignited the spark I felt when seeing her. After that call we talked by text or phone nearly every day. I have a very high standard for people I date and felt really comfortable with her. We lived on different sides of the country so we knew this was special to still be giving things a shot. 2 weeks after the phone call, I bought tickets to see her along with family in 4 weeks. I saw her for a weekend, spent a week with family, then planned on spending a week with her after that (turned into 2). Things went very well and felt really good and for the first time in a very long time I felt like I was falling for somebody. The first weekend felt incredible and very romantic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward about a month after that visit, I was staying with her again and we talked about monogamy (for the 2nd time - I proposed it at the end of the 2 week visit and she said she wasn’t comfortable with that yet, even though she was only seeing me). During that talk, I asked her the last time she slept with somebody else, and she said it was sometime after we started talking. That was fine by me. I decided to stop seeing anybody else the day after our phone call, because I really felt like this was special). 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days after that, she told me that she had miscalculated the days, and slept with somebody in-between my visits. She was seeing this person casually (the guy wanted more) from around the same time we started talking on the phone, up until their last visit after I flew out the first time, and flew back the 2nd time. She said she really didn’t want to the last time, but “logically” she needed to make sure I was right for me by sleeping with him one last time (??).

&amp;#x200B;

Hearing this crushed me. She consistently told me and made me feel like she was only thinking about me and I genuinely thought this might be a start of something really serious. Turns out everybody in her friend group and even the guy knew she was seeing 2 people at once. Everybody but me. She told me it was because she was scared, which is understandable, but upsetting to know she wasn’t ever going to tell me this without me prying. I feel like she was taking advantage of the grey area and would do so in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve also thought about the fact that this was either a massive miscalculation or she lied to me the first time we talked about it. Either route feels awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been struggling with this for weeks and don’t know what to do. I don’t get feelings easily and felt like I was in the clouds with this girl, and haven’t felt that way since hearing this. When I’m with her things usually feel good, but 45 minute after she flew out, the feeling came right back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way back from here? Is it even worth it? I feel like there’s somebody who would treat me with the respect I deserve, but I also do feel like she’s really trying to be a good partner now.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

\*\*tl;dr\*\*: Girl I was falling for was sleeping with somebody while we were falling for each other and even after I flew to see her. Didn't tell me until I brought it up. Not sure whether trying to make it work is worth it.","She told you she wasn’t comfortable committing to you when you proposed the idea. Somewhere around that time she was also seeing someone else and slept with him. She was not committed to you and that was clear. Just because your feelings are strong for her doesn’t mean she has to react the same way as you by cutting off anyone she was previously seeing. 

I think you need to take a step back. You seem to be way overthinking this relationship and have your head in the clouds a bit. It’s new. You’re both single people. It’s okay to be excited, but to place silent expectations on her to not sleep with other people is unfair to her."

"Yesterday my older sister (34) called me, distraught, and told me she cheated on her husband of 10 years. And it wasn’t merely a drunken one night stand. It was a multiple day affair with someone she’s harbored feelings for, and it happened while her husband was out of town.

My sister is 10 years older than me (24F) and we are incredibly close. I have always looked up to her — put her on a pedestal, even — so this is devastating to me. I love her husband like my own brother and I’m devastated for him, too. He doesn’t know. No one knows but me. I did my best to be supportive and encouraged her to tell him, but she said she couldn’t do it. 

This has been weighing on me so heavily for more than 24 hours. My sister swore me to secrecy so I haven’t even told my own husband. I want to tell him but I feel trapped by my loyalty to my sister. We’re supposed to see them (my sister and her husband) in two weeks and I’m worried that if I tell my husband, he won’t be able to play it off at our family function. And I don’t want to have to lie to my sister when she inevitably asks if I’ve told him.

If you were in my situation, would you tell your spouse ASAP or wait until after our event? If it helps, the event is a two year old’s birthday party (MY two year old). Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

EDIT: Just to be clear I don’t want to tell her husband, I think she should be the one to do that. But I do want to tell my own husband.

"She is a sweet person, but has the tendency to be really stubborn and do whatever she wants, putting a lot of emphasis on what she thinks is best for someone and having a low regard for others’ opinions and desires. 

Thing is, recently I realized it’s too much and it struck me that this might be a sign that she doesn’t respect myself. There have been multiple instances when she was about to come to my place and, knowing she’s used to bring something whenever she comes by, I specifically told her not to bring anything. My reasons don’t matter here, and I figured if she really cares about my wishes and respects me as a person, she will not do it, but, nonetheless, I do it because I can afford almost anything (reasonable) I want, she has a way smaller pension than I have a salary (and she used to manage twice as much a monthly income before her mother, my great-grandma with Alzheimer’s, passed away; she tries to save as much money as possible and is currently on a deficit from then), some (or most, to be honest) of the items she buys aren’t among my preferences, and I feel frustrated that she spends money on things which don’t bring me joy, etc. 

But last time, I wanted to buy her something for lunch, I called her to ask if she’s okay with it, she agreed and then I, again, told her to not bring anything. She brought two bags of sweets and drinks. As soon as I saw that, I got reaaaally upset and left the room to get a nap, because I was starting to feel sick from anger. I felt as if she doesn’t give a shit about my wishes and doesn’t respect me as a person.

Today, a few days after that event, she called and we discussed about that happening. I got furious again when she said that I’m too proud to accept things from her. I told her I’ve decided to stop buying anything to her, without having wanted to do so, because I want to avoid these kinds of situations where she buys things to me or wants to pay me back, primarily to also stop her buying anything to me. She added that she understands this has strained our relationship and that we won’t be communicating from now on due to his, even though that’s not what I said and what I meant.

I care about my grandma, even though she’s so difficult to deal with sometimes, but the fact that she appears to not respect my wishes makes me isolate from her. Is there anything else to be done in order to resuscitate the relationship, while also having mutual respect for each other?

TL;DR: Grandma doesn’t seem to respect me and keeps on buying things even though I asked her not to, and I don’t know what to do to fix this.","Dude, she's not buying you cars or houses. Let grandma be grandma and bring you sweets and drinks."
"I (28F) signed up for medical coding classes spring of 2021 because I thought it was something I could handle as a career. I'm 28 and have never found a job that works for me. I'm autistic, ADHD, and have recurring problems with depression and anxiety. Basically, I can't work around/with other people as my auditory processing disorder makes it hard to interact with people who I'm not completely comfortable with.

My mom suggested medical coding because a lot of the jobs are remote. And I've spent over $2000 on books and classes and am still paying a monthly amount for access to my classes which I haven't touched in like three months. My husband helped me pay for my books which are now out of date and not allowed for the exam, so I have to buy all new ones. The exam is hundreds of dollars too. And I can't do it. For the first 1/4 of the course, I did great. And then it got way more complicated and I just cannot wrap my head around it. I mean it literally makes my head hurt.

I was failing all my quizzes before I just gave up a few months ago but everyone still thinks I'm working on it. My husband (30M) and I have been together for three years and want to start trying for a baby next month but he's hinging our whole future on my having a medical coding job and I am scared to tell him that I hate it and can't do it and don't want to finish it. It makes me miserable; I hate it so much. And I've tried desperately to find any other feasible ideas for long term work to soften the blow, but I've got nothing. I work less than ten hours a week doing paperwork for a real estate agency and that even stresses me out. I'm useless. I'm a failure and my husband is going to be so upset.

We've had some really intense issues with communication in the past. He's been in therapy and gotten on medication which has helped absolutely enormously, but I'd still say we're like 75% of the way to where we should be. He's been very kind and open to communicating better and I'm optimistic about that, but he can be a major overthinker and tends to do the worst-case-scenario thing. I feel that with some better budgeting, we'd be fine starting a family with the money coming in between us now, but he doesn't feel that way. I'm afraid he's going to push back us having a baby because of this and that's literally all I've ever wanted to be is a mom. It's the only thing in the world I've ever wanted and known I can do.

The stress of keeping this all to myself is eating me alive. I feel like I can't breathe from the weight of my thoughts and fears. I don't know what to do or how to tell him.

"So we just stared dating about 2 months ago, and it’s getting serious, we both want monogamy , and I’ve been vocal and transparent with my struggles as a sexual addict. The issue is she doesn’t like to be sexualized, but still wants me to be exclusive to her. She’s been open to the idea of polyamory but I don’t want that either. 

My thing is, I always feel like I’m too hyper sexual for my partners and that makes me step out and cheat, not justifying the bad behavior of course but that’s just one of the triggers for me. 

I’m actively in therapy, I started going to sexual addicts anonymous meetings, and I’ve been reducing things that make me want to see other women like watching porn, dating apps, and social media scrolling etc. 

I just don’t understand how am I supposed to be exclusive to only one person and that one person doesn’t like me being overtly sexual with them? If not her, then who? I’ll provide examples. 

1. Let’s say she’s stretching, she’ll say just help her stretch and don’t admire how nice her butt looks. 

2. Sometimes she’ll say something to me and Ill mindlessly respond “that’s hot” like she’ll say I’m so sweaty and I’ll say “that’s hot. “

3. I hold the door open for her and I slap her on the butt as she walks past. 

I feel like these are healthy ways of maintains sexual attraction and enjoyment, and again, I have a lot of sexual desire and If I’m going to be focusing on one person a lot comes with it.

We found out she was 2 months pregnant with her ex’s child early on into dating (he completely ghosted her upon finding out about the pregnancy and wanted nothing to do with the child and hasn’t been around since; child is 3 months old). When she found out she told me it was completely okay and understandable if I wanted to stop seeing each other as this was very unexpected. I have cared for this girl for over 2 years (we were friends first) and I didn’t want to lose her. I wanted to be there for her and this child and be the father in every way (except biologically).

The last one we had was the day before her birthday (4 days before the baby was born).

Since then my girlfriend has been distant. She hasn’t been affectionate at all, she doesn’t seem to like when I touch her, sometimes she sleeps in the living room and keeps the baby with her vs coming into the room, and she just honestly looks dead behind her eyes when I tell her I love her.

The last incident was a mess. I have another ex (let’s call her L) that I dated all through middle school and most of high school. We split senior year and we stayed best friends. My gf was okay with the friendship (she knows L and knows she  has zero feelings for me and I her). Basically I keep in contact with the L’s mom as well and she has always wanted us back together. I had (stupidly) told my L’s mom in late January that if I thought my ex still felt that way about me I’d try and get back with her. Well word got back to my girlfriend and she was really hurt.”

Also stop saying I cheated because my girlfriend has even said that I have not.  I did fucked up shit that crossed boundaries, yes but I didn’t cheat. When I entertained women I mean they flirted and I let them, when they asked about a number or taking it further, I told them I had a girlfriend. Buying the explicit content, I should’ve thought that through. She said it’s porn and doesn’t bother her but not to purchase from people I know. Hanging out with my one ex, we met up for a drink. She attempted something and put my girlfriend down, but I shut her down and left. She said this bothered her but all I did was meet for a drink thinking it might be possible to remain friends. She said she wasn’t a fan of it but I didn’t do anything with her and  I didn’t cheat. Same with the L situation. I did some stupid ass shit, but I asked my girlfriend if she felt I cheated at all and she has always said no but I need better boundaries

"Okay maybe it’s just me, but when I first met my partner (M, 23), I wasn’t too keen on his B.O. But as we got to know each other more and spend more time with each other, I started really liking his smell! Flash forward three years later, we’re going through a breakup after I discovered about some cheating incidents (and a long list of other other reasons we just aren’t compatible any more) and I can’t stand his smell now! It’s like REALLY repulsive to me. Like way worse than when I first met him! Anyone by any chance gone through something like this?

"I recently had a horrible break-up with my man of four years, and we just had a baby boy back in October. When I came back to work because we really needed the money, shortly after I found out that my boss was the reason for all this. She was sleeping with him, and when he left he moved right in with her. I’m devastated and heartbroken. I had to quit because I could not bear to think of working and having to listen to her tell me what to do. What do you think I should do? I lost everything because of her?","I’m sorry that happened. It would be awful under any circumstances, but to find out that your boss — someone with whom there’s a certain vulnerability built into the relationship and who you generally assume isn’t actively working to destroy your personal life — was the person your partner was cheating with would add a whole additional level of betrayal to an already horrible situation.
When you ask what you should do, I think you’re wondering if there’s something official you can do professionally — like filing a complaint? In theory you could try that (most companies do not want their managers sleeping with employees’ partners and it’s possible they’d be interested to know that’s why you quit) but there’s not really anything for you to gain by doing that (and the potential for a lot of drama on top of what’s already happened). I’d rather see you leave her in your past and focus on moving forward."
"This will probably be long, sorry!

I was raised and grew up in a very conservative very religious household and community. It was to the point where everything and everyone’s purpose was to serve our religion and our community. I was homeschooled all the way up until college, and then the college I attended was a small school run by members of the same group. To say I was sheltered is very much an understatement.

I met my husband there (another devout believer like me), we “dated,” which mostly consisted of attending prayer services together, until we finished school, and then we immediately married. I became a schoolteacher, and his work required occasional travel, but we made a happy life together never really leaving the confines of our community.

A little over a year ago that was all turned upside down. My husband was offered a very high-paying job in the suburbs of a fairly major city. It would require him to travel a bit more, but we’d be substantially better off. We talked about it and decided to do it, especially since there was also an opening at a school in the area where we were moving. 

So we set it all up. He took the job, we bought a new house, and I was hired to teach at this new school. Once I started working there, I was hit with quite a bit of culture shock. All sorts of new ideas, people, and beliefs were coming at me quicker than I really had time to process. It was very overwhelming at first, especially since I’d rarely ever had to deal with someone even outside of our religion. 

So to shorten this up a little and get to my point, eventually I started to come around to question some of the things I’d been taught and I’d believed all growing up. Specifically, I met a male colleague who was just very different. He was charming, confident, witty, intelligent,  and (honestly) attractive, and he believed none of what I did. We had amazing discussions and debates during our shared lunch together. I realized eventually that I wasn’t really sure how much of what I believed. I wasn’t sure if I’d ever really thought hard about it, and now that I was, I was questioning. I found myself talking about subjects I’d never talked about, laughing at jokes that would have horrified previous me, but I also found myself happier than I was, even though I had thought I was happy.

All of this was, of course, without my husband’s knowledge. He is, was, and always will be a true believer. Recently, it’s made me think less of him, both intellectually and physically. On top of that, I think I also have feelings for my coworker. 

Tl;dr—To sum it all up, I’m not really sure if my husband and I have anything in common beyond our religion, and meeting someone new has opened my eyes to that and to perhaps my being a different person than I thought I was even, and I’m not sure what to do at all!","These need to all be separate things - rethinking your world/religious views, your relationship with your husband, new relationship with someone else if you choose not to stay in your marriage.  Right now they sound pretty conflated and intertwined and that's going to be a mess.

I suggest distancing yourself from the hottie and working on the other two with your husband and/or professional help."
"How do I move for the first time? I’m 22 years old and just finished my undergrad degree. I’m currently living with my parents and working service jobs, but I’m really trying to move and start my life. The only problem is that I need somewhere cheap (under $700/mo) because I don’t have anyone I could split rent with. 

Every apartment I’ve looked at requires me to be able to show income that’s 3x rent for at least three months. I’m trying to find a job via indeed, glassdoor, etc, but no one’s really hiring right now and everyone wants 4+ years experience for entry level positions. So until I can land something there I can’t show the required “income” because most of my income comes from tips.

"My fiance and I met on eHarmony 6 years ago. In the beginning of the relationship I was unfaithful and we broke up after 4 years. We have since reconciled and have been back together for 5 months. Since we have been back together we have an awesome relationship in every way except sexual. We have only had sex about 6 times and everytime is worse than the last. Now it's to the point where I don't like the way her vagina feels. I try to avoid sex because it seems like I become less and less physically attracted to her every time. The few times we did have intercourse I've had to imagine being with someone else in order to keep an erection. Afterwards I would feel nauseous disgusted. I love my fiance and we have a 5 year old together but I don't know what I should do. I feel like I kissed my cousin when I kiss her and just the thought of anything physical with her makes me feel completely turned off. I am not cheating on her but I am very sexually frustrated. We talk and get along great in every way except physically. She is smart, pretty, strong, brave she's got integrity and she is an excellent mom and homemaker. This is the only woman that I have ever been with that I dreaded being intimate with. Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Also we have set a date for February and I am very apprehensive about spending the rest of my life with someone I dread sex with.

TL;Dr 6yr on and off again relationship with fiance 41yr old F I am 44yr old M and scared there's no sexual chemistry","So you were broken up, you’ve only been back together 5 months and you’re already talking about getting married in FEBRUARY? And you’re not even sexually attracted to her? Do you seriously need Reddit to tell you how dumb of an idea this is?

You can talk to her about it, but I imagine telling her “hey, I’m not sexually attracted to you and I have to think of other women to get off” won’t come off great and would destroy her confidence. Honestly, you probably should’ve stayed separated. There is no magic fix for this. This on/off thing isn’t doing either of you or your child any favors."
"my boyfriend is gonna break up with me if i go abroad for college
i (f18) am a high school senior and i'm at the stage of applying to different universities. so i live in a city where going abroad for university is a really popular option, especially given its political state at the moment. i don't want to fully disclose the city i live in but it's known as an international city where a lot of non-native/foreign people, like us, reside.

i've been dating my boyfriend (m18) for almost 2 years now and he's currently studying in a local university. i've been wanting to study in australia for a while now, even before i met my bf. my family is planning to immigrate there and my older sister already got a job there and is in the works of managing her move. 

my boyfriend and i talked about studying in australia together but he ended up not being able to go. now it's my turn to decide whether i want to stay here or study there. i'm getting really anxious at the fact that even though the local universities here are highly regarded and have high global university rankings, i feel that their education won't really work with me. and having studied in a local school previously and currently being in an international school allowed me to compare the two environments. and i feel stuck in a local environment since they're so competitive and have a toxic learning environment. i also feel like i would thrive being abroad since this city is so suffocating, i just want to get out. but at the same time, i applied for the national university here and im scared i won't be able to get in.

my parents are kinda encouraging me to go to australia and they know that the only reason i want to stay is because of my boyfriend. i know that it's wrong to let him hold me back, but my love for him runs really deep. but im questioning whether it's right to stay with him since he's letting me know that he would want to break up with me if i ultimately go to australia for university since he can't manage long distance relationships. i thought that partners would encourage their significant other to achieve great things and that they would stick by them despite ldrs being really difficult. i know that's an immature way of looking at relationships but i've seen that work for my oldest sister and her husband before they got married.

i feel like this might be able to summarise everything you need to know about my situation but i still have so many f thoughts and feelings but i don't think they're relevant for this post. i just don't really know what to do right now. do i stay here with someone i genuinely see a future with or do i go to australia and potentially lose a lifelong partner?","Hey OP, when I was 18 i was dating a guy, and I was planning to go only a few states over for college and he was gonna break up with me. 

Guess what, I didn't go to college. But we ended up breaking up regardless. It didn't matter that I stayed. Our relationship got worse cuz I started hating him for making me make that decision. And our relationship slowly became abusive, neglectful and very unhealthy for both of us. 

Go to Australia. Now that my ex and I have broken up, I'm currently travelling the world and planning on starting school in the fall. What you want is so much more important than a relationship where he doesn't even find you worth it to try and stay together. Or support your dreams. 

It's gonna suck at first, but one time you'll find someone who supports your dreams even if they separate you for some time.

"How to not be socially awkward? I'm afraid of talking to others, especially girls. Most of the times I avoid going to events just because of this fear. I have no friends because of this habit. I just freeze when my name is called upon in the class. I can't even sit normally or eat something when there are people around.
TL;DR how do I perform better in social situations?","Hey there, the best advice I ever received for social situations was from my psych prof. He told us, ""don't try to be an interesting person - try to be an interested person"".  

So basically just ask questions about the other person:  ""that's a great ____ where did you get it?"" ""Have you been following the ____?  What do you think?""  Nothing too personal, and if they say something that resonates with you, acknowledge it, without turning the whole conversation to yourself - say just enough to encourage them to keep talking.  

Also, mirror them a bit, but not too obviously. If they put their hands in their pockets, you do the same.  It creates an unconscious connection. 

As for being in the classroom, don't worry about saying the right thing every time. Nobody really cares, most people are focusing on their own stuff. If you already know everything, you're in the wrong class, so don't be afraid to be wrong, you're there to learn, not impress the 30 some odd peers that you'll probably never see after graduation. 

Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself.  This is not life and death. Remind yourself of that once in awhile."
"So my (m22) girlfriend (17f) asked me to stop smoking weed yesterday because she doesn't like how I ""act"" when I'm high. She says I don't pay enough attention to what she is saying, and when I'm sober I'm super attentive to her.

I don't understand what she means by this so we argue about this for some time. This weed issue has come up before. She got into a fight with my best friend over weed because of something I can't remember. She has complained about me smelling like smoke before as well.

Anyway, back to the fight. We argue and end up compromising that I should only smoke 2 days a week. She started with smoking every other day but 2 days is where we compromised. So here is my issue. I've never asked her to chance anything. Yet she is asking me?

"Should I walk away or try and make it work

Hello! This is my first Reddit post, but I am desperately looking for some help and insight. I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together since we were 18. 
We are both currently in University, I am in my masters and he is finishing his bachelors.
Things started out really good because we started out as friends. As our relationship grew, it feels as if we have grown apart. He spends all of his free time playing video games. I find myself always cooking and cleaning, even after being gone for 12 hours a day with work and school. If i don’t cook for him, he eats out. He doesn’t plan for us to go on dates, won’t go to the gym with me and walks away when I’m talking about something I’m interested in if he doesn’t like it. He always says I should be the one planning the dates, but I work 25 hours a week with full time school and clients. He works 15 hours a week and cheats on his classes, and will average 8-10 hours of video games a day.
I have expressed I need him to do more, I feel like i am doing everything and it’s burning me out. I want to do fun things with him and it would help a lot if he could plan things for us, but it’s just in one ear and out the other.
He is bad at expressing how he feels, so he rarely compliments me, or tells me he loves me. We haven’t been physical in 4 months even after I’ve expressed it being important to me, along with me asking him to help out around the apartment more. 
We’ve had multiple conversations where he is good for a week, and then back to his old habits. He says things seem bad because we are both so busy, but in the free time we do have he either watches YouTube or is playing video games. 
He is a good guy, he’s smart, playful, handsome and I know he would never do anything to hurt me. But I feel like this relationship is more of a friendship and we are two friends living in the same place. 
Any advice to help our relationship, or similar experiences? I’ve thought about walking away multiple times, and every time I try, he says/ or does something that makes me think he will change. I really don’t know what to do.. i love him but maybe there is someone better out there for me? Thank you for the advice!
TL;DR my boyfriend doesn’t cook or clean, and spends all his time playing video games. We never see each-other and it’s mostly because we are in the same room and he’s too busy playing his games.","You’ve had multiple conversations and he hasn’t change. Take it from someone who is now 29 and been through this exact thing. He won’t change. Get out, cut your losses. He’ll either realise in time that he needs to change, or be someone else’s problem.

When you say “he wouldn’t do anything to hurt you” he IS hurting you. Right now. He isn’t fulfilling your needs and is emotionally hurting you by making you feel this way. If he cared he would make you the priority and have listened previously.

You deserve a partner, not a teenager."
"How to get over a lost friend Because of myself being generally a bad friend, and moving halfway across the country, I lost a very important and very dear friend. It's really been getting to me, and I've found it really, really difficult to get over this lost friendship. She was a wonderful friend, but we pretty much cut contact. 

Does anyone have any tips at all for coping with losing a very close friend and help forgetting about them? It's not normally ever difficult for me but I was pretty emotionally attached to this friend, and we were very close. I'll make sure not to do that again, but how do I forget her?",Forgetting is difficult and probably shouldn't be the aim. I would say the focus should be on remembering who you are and want to be as an individual. Use this to motivate and fill your time and you will find yourself thinking about them less and less.
"I’m a guy who’s always loved sports, the outdoors and my buddies. I’ve been close with half a dozen guys from high school and a couple of buddies from college.
But lately, the gang isn’t as close. Three guys got married, and two of them already have kids. We’re all around the same age (I’m 28), but it feels like everything’s changed and it’s worrying me.
Then I realized I’m lucky in another way: I got a job in a health-care field and I enjoy how my work helps people. I have the chance to travel overseas for a special course that’ll take me to a higher level.
Though I’d like to hang out with the guys, I now feel I’m on my right track, regarding the present and my future.
But how do I stay friends with people I care about, when I’m living a whole different lifestyle?","First, you stay in touch with long-time friends whatever way you can. Ask about their kids (learn their names) and their wives (remember their names, too) and the guys’ jobs.
Also, share some “good old times” stories from the past, and some of the great sports moments watched or played together with these special buddies.
In time, some of you will catch up with each other. You’ll rehash some of the old sports plays on special occasions, and you’ll stretch those past friendships to a new normal of getting together whenever possible."
"How To Recover From A Tough Breakup I'm struggling quite a bit right, now, and I know this is probably material for/r/depressed but I feel like the LPT community is a lot more responsive. 

Anyway, girlfriend of 2 years just broke up with me out of the blue. No reason why except that there was someone else (which I've basically confirmed by the power of social media), but that doesn't really bother me much. I'm struggling because I don't understand how somebody who tells you on a daily basis that they love you and they care about you can just walk away like that. Ice been in few, but very lengthy relationships so I've dealt with this before, and this by far had hit the hardest. I was so happy, and as a person who struggles with depression and anxiety, it really is starting to feel like I'm not good enough or I'm just doing everything wrong. I don't know how to get my mind off of her, and although I've got a few close friends supporting me,  I'm still having a really difficult time. I don't even understand what went wrong, she never told me anything and the fact that she always talked about some guy she hangs out with didn't help my situation. I just need closure but I know not everything can be fixed. Anywho, all replies are appreciated. 

TL;DR- Struggling with past and present relationship problems and need advice on how to cope with and recover somewhat quickly.",Get a gym membership. Breakups build body builders. Not saying that's what you want or should do but it's a good activity that will boost your self confidence. Something you can do for an hour or two a day to take your mind off things.
"How to get more guy time without affecting a serious relationship? I had been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years when we split up due to her clingyness and need for constant attention, including taking literally all of my free time. We broke up, and I spent nearly 6 months or the 7 we were apart by myself, completely alone. I loved the freedom, but I missed her. So I eventually reunited my relationship with said girlfriend.

We had a son our first year into our relationship, so I can understand her wanting to spend a lot of family time together, but I literally work, and spend time with her watching tv or helping with dinner or some other everyday thing. I have zero time to myself. We've been back together for almost a year now and her clingyness has renewed itself in full force. I can't even take a shower by myself without her having to constantly be around me or keep tabs on me.

I just want a few hours to myself maybe outside on the porch, or in the shed, or even a night out fishing with some buddies, but all of these tasks as of now must include her. I feel like we suffer a lot of relationship problems due to the stress that is caused by us being around each other all the time. She even started working where I work 6 months ago, and so I have absolutely no time to myself unless I use the bathroom at work.

How can I get her to realize I need some time to myself without her thinking I don't love her?","You need to have a serious talk with her. State very plainly that while you will continue to spend time with her, you also need some time to do your thing. Let her know that smothering you is bad for your relationship. Healthy relationships need space. 

She needs to develop *her* own thing so she won't be so codependent on you. Take your kid out and let her have some me time. Then alternate."
"Student Loan Repayments ? Does anyone have any real experience in this?  As far as options I can use and lower interest and not get COMPLETELY screwed by Fed Loan Servicing?       
I have about $10,000 left to pay.  I really can't make the payments, and have been in forbearance mode for a couple years.  I graduated in 2010, and was supposed to start repaying in 2011.  I made a couple payments, but then have been on and off of unemployment for the past couple of years.","You can only be in forbearance a maximum of 36 months total, so it sounds like you're near exhausting this as an option. Income Based Repayment will definitely lower your monthly payments, but you need to be aware that it extends the life of the loan to 25 years AND you have to provide verification of income annually. That means as your income changes, your payments will change up or down depending on what you're earning that year. Because it's a longer loan, you will pay a butt-load more in interest. The good-ish news is any amount left on your loan at the end of 25 years is forgiven. The bad-ish news is the forgiven amount is taxable income, so be as prepared as possible.

IBR is fab because your payments will never be more than 15% of your discretionary income. 

To qualify for IBR, you will need to prove partial financial hardship. As you've been on and off unemployment, you should be good with just documentation of that. But if you're near exhausting your unemployment benefits, you can register with a temp agency.

One other thing - if you are married and your spouse has student loan debt too, BOTH spouse's loans and both spouse's incomes are considered in calculating what your new monthly payment amount will be under IBR.  

You can apply for IBR through your servicer or studentloans.gov. The feds are pushing the IBR plan pretty hard lately because it gives more people a chance to pay back something on their loans and avoid default. 

Loan consolidation is another option, but check with your servicer first to see if the savings on monthly payments is affordable for you.

"So heres the thing, I work in a warehouse, specifically I used to work in shipping, but now I'm more of a tech girl. And I liked the shipping guys, but there is one coworker in particular this post is about. For these purposes we'll call him Jason.

Jason isn't necessarily a bad guy, hes funny and nice but the problem is he kind of has a.....odd personality. He was prior service military, so he doesn't really have a filter when it comes to saying stuff and he seems to be very up close and personal when he talks to people. But very likeable guy, but my biggest issue with him was that I thought he wanted to date me and that was why he talked to me so much.

Well, I was talking to one of of my coworkers at lunch. And we started talking about our lives. And one thing led to another. And I said 'I mean, Jason's kind of a creep.""

Well, I see her face go 'Uh oh."" And then I turned around.

And well the breakroom is connected to one of the entrances. And it just so happened as soon as I said that, Jason actually walked through the door. And heard me say that.

Well, he seemed to be okay, he obviously paused when he heard that, but he walked away so I figured he didn't take it personal.

Well a week goes by, and it was a really quiet week, and I couldn't figure out why. And then when I got to the weekend, I realized Jason did not ONCE try to talk to me. Usually he would ask me how my day was, but he wasn't anymore.

I mean yeah I felt like he could be a creep at times, but I just wish he would tone it down, I didn't want to stop talking to him completely.

So the next week I try to say Hi to him because I felt bad for saying that about him to his face. And I can't find him anywhere. But I talk to all the other shipping gremlins. And they're all saying how Jason has been reserved for the past two weeks. He doesn't tell jokes anymore, usually he would tell 'Would you rathers' to everyone. But he hadn't done that in two weeks. All he did was focus on work, go to the gym and go home.

Another week goes by, and I noticed whenever I would walk to say hi to my friends from Shipping, Jason would get a really uncomfortable look on his face before he would walk away.

Again, another week goes by and hes still not really talking to anyone. He even deactivated his facebook and got off social media. I know this because he had a group chat with all of us in it on facebook messenger where he would share memes that he found funny. But then next thing we know the group chat was shut down.

I mean he's not a bad guy, its just that sometimes he comes off as a creeper, I know he's probably a little mad about being called that, but I didn't want to stop talking to him completely, I just wanted him to back off a little and give me some space. But now hes just giving me too much space.

I just felt like he could go over the top with socializing and just wish he could tone it down. But with the way hes been for the past few weeks, its almost like he only has the two moods, over the top and excitable or quiet and reserved.

I want to apologize but my work schedule is usually busy, and he won't hang out with anyone outside of work.

But at the same time I don't want to apologize because he was just TOO excitable for me and I felt like he could back off a little.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Felt like my coworker was coming on too strong, called him a creep to his face, but now hes isolating himself and won't talk to anyone and now I feel like I may have hurt him.","This guy heard you say this - 

&gt;'I mean, Jason's kind of a creep.""

Yet in your post, you're saying -

&gt;yeah I felt like he could be a creep at times, but I just wish he would tone it down, I didn't want to stop talking to him completely.  
&gt;  
&gt;he's not a bad guy, its just that sometimes he comes off as a creeper, \[...\] but I didn't want to stop talking to him completely, I just wanted him to back off a little and give me some space. But now hes just giving me too much space.

&gt;But at the same time I don't want to apologize because he was just TOO excitable for me and I felt like he could back off a little.

Be real, he heard you say he's kind of a creep.  There's no way he can read your mind and know all the qualifiers you're saying here and what you ""really meant"" when you called him kind of a creep.  There's no way a reasonable man would hear a woman in the workplace call him a creep and think, ""oh, I should just talk to her a little less, but otherwise, it's all good.""

Maybe you think he's gone too far in keeping to himself, but again, this is a workplace, he may be concerned about being in good standing at his job and not making unintended waves.  It's not like he wonders or suspects he might be making someone uncomfortable at work, so should he change his behavior?  He now knows he is.  He heard you call him a creep with his own ears.

I know you didn't mean for him to hear you, but it happened and he's adjusted his behaviors accordingly.  He can't read your mind.  Honestly, I'm getting vibes that the real factor here is you don't want to feel bad about him overhearing you, and his adjusted behaviors are making you feel bad, and it wouldn't make you feel as bad if he magically knew he didn't have to change this much.  But still you punctuate with, ""but I also don't want to apologize \[and clear up this misunderstanding\] because his behavior is enough of a problem that I shouldn't clear anything up.""  Confusing messaging here for sure."

"Hi all,

In the UK here. Bit of background first, one of my best friends (17F) has been seeing this guy (20M) for just over a month now. She seems to like him, though sometimes mentions things he's done that have upset her. Thought to include this as they're not actually together at the moment, just seeing each other so to speak. 

Yesterday my friend told me, deadly serious, that she's thought about wanting a kid for a while and wants to try for one with this guy she's not dating and has only known for a month. Apparantley she's asked the guy and he's decided to go for it, and has even offered to leave his job to move away with her (she's planning on moving to a foreign country when she turns 18 and has made him aware of this).

I don't know what to think about the whole thing. I'm convinced she's not thought about it properly, hence why she wants to do it with a guy she's known for a month. If it was me being asked this by a girl after talking to her for such a short time I would have run the other way, but its just the thing of he's so happy to oblige. 

Any thoughts, advice on what to say to her, all welcome.

TL,DR: Friend wants to have a baby with a guy she's been seeing for a month, advice please?Just want to thank everyone for the info and suggestions, not gonna be overly critical of her because as people say it's her life to ruin at the end of the day, but also want to try and make her see sense.

"I've been with my partner for just over a year now, and I've noticed more and more recently that I feel like I have to hide my interests or he'll make fun of me.

I decline to play any of the music I'm into around him since the one time I did he mocked me for it. We were even talking about what music we listened to when we were teenagers and how we both tried to be cool, and he said that he never cared what other people listened to, if it made them happy that's what mattered. But from past times with him that thinking doesn't apply to me, since apparently any and all kpop is the exception to the rule. I've been struggling with my mental health so much recently, and music's been the one thing I can rely on to make me feel any joy, but it feels like he's managed to taint that by mocking me.

I've also started trying to learn some Korean so I can understand lyrics, and it's just a cool skill to have in my opinion. To help with picking up new vocabulary I tend to have a Google translate page open on my phone so I can quickly pick up new words I hear. He saw this and immediately started mocking people who learn Korean, going through the usual Koreaboo/kpop stan stereotypes, not even considering that I might be learning. I even ended up hiding any evidence just in case he saw when he came over so he wouldn't find out. I'm just not going to ever tell him at this point.

I've always tried so hard to engage with his interests, even if I'd never actually seek out anything about them otherwise, because I know from past experiences how shitty it feels to have people just not care. I don't know how to stop caring so much about this, but it really gets to me and makes me feel really uncared for. 

TL,DR: I feel I have to hide my interests from my partner so he doesn't mock me

EDIT: Thank you all so much for all your responses to this, I really wasn't expecting this many people to see it, so while I can't reply to everyone (sorry!) I am reading every single one. I'm not going to lie and say I'm going to immediately change everything and start standing up for myself because I know what I'm like, but I will definitely be talking more about this with my therapist and hopefully make some progress towards loving myself.

"How can I get better at achieving my goals? Hi everyone, I’ve kind of had an unsteady year with having to move houses multiple times and travelling a lot. I’ve been really good at fixating on things and working hard to achieve them but over the last few months I’ve noticed that I have sudden bursts of energy and motivation where I come up with plenty of ideas/goals/thing I wish to do (both in my personal life as well as professional) but then the smallest distraction happens and I find it hard to commit to them. For instance, I had a sudden urge to start dancing more, learning dance, opening a dance account etc. but then I was upset due to a personal issue for a few weeks and just kinda left it there. These disruptions keep happening and I feel like I don’t really achieve anything. How to best deal with this?

"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for almost 2 years now.

He has a female friend who he got close to a few months before we got close. As our relationship has progressed, I’m getting more and more uncomfortable with their friendship. Just to clarify, they are only friends (at least from my boyfriend’s perspective). I feel sometimes he almost forgets about me when she is around and how close they are physically also makes me uncomfortable. 

Some examples include:
-them almost (we debate whether or not it actually happened) grinding at a club and stopping when I caught sight of them. She stepped away when she saw me. He apologised and we dropped it. 
-They’re super cuddly and huggy - for example it’s not uncommon to see his arm around her if they’re sitting together. In contrast, physical touch is my love language and to me, he used to say that he struggles with physical affection. I’ll admit that it stung to see him do with her what I would wanted. 
-He recently was wrapping a scarf around her neck. He was doing it for her which I found rather intimate. 
-She had her head rested on his shoulder when we were out bowling. 
-Walking in a group, they tend to gravitate towards each other even when I don’t have other people to talk to. Situations like this make me feel kind of forgotten by my BF. 

We recently had an argument where I felt he prioritised her over me. She was being disrespectful (which he agreed with but said he didn’t have an issue with it. He even went out of his way to tell her he wasn’t mad at her but other friends were). He wanted me to leave his place because he had some work to get done. She asked for a favour (that would have taken her only 10 minutes to do herself) and he agreed very easily despite me and friends advising him not to enable certain behaviours of hers. He postponed his work to run her errand for her. She was disrespectful to me and his other friends and hadn’t apologised yet even. I feel he disregarded my feelings and went out of his way to do something for her which she didn’t deserve at that point and which he didn’t want to do for me. 

Initially I wasn’t too bothered by their behaviour but it’s kind upsetting me after seeing him wrapping a scarf around her. It feels so intimate and I don’t like he shares this physical intimacy with someone else. I didn’t want to project my feelings onto their friendship but I’m feeling too uncomfortable to just suppress it. I feel their physical intimacy (when he supposedly had to learn how to be physically affectionate with me) feels disrespectful to our relationship. I don’t know if this is just jealousy or this level of intimacy is too much between friends. He’s just always with her and there’s so much touching. 

How would you feel if this was your partner? Is this something I just have to deal with? Am I being unreasonable? If I do talk to him, what kind of boundaries do I even have the right to establish in his friendships? 

TLDR: boyfriend is very physically intimate with female friend which makes me uncomfortable. He recently disregarded my feelings about her to run an errand for her when he was advised not to even by other friends. This made me feel second to his friendship. Is it just me being unreasonable or do I get to have a say in how he can act with friends?

Edit: Does it change things if most of the time they spend together is in group settings with me included as well? It’s not to say he’s only affectionate with her. He’s undoubtedly more physically intimate with than with her. But I feel certain things should only be for your partner. He’s otherwise a great boyfriend very considerate and open to listening but I feel some things you shouldn’t have to tell your partner not to do and this feels like one of them. But how much slack can I cut him until it feels like he doesn’t care enough about my feelings to even notice that these things are inappropriate without me telling him?","I'm sorry this is happening to you. 

While I'm pretty affectionate with most of my male friends this seems off even to me. 

He's not cheating, but it definitely seems he's harboring some pretty deep romantic feelings for her. Since he's not willing to put any distant between them two for the sake of your relationship, I would end this.

Be abundantly clear about why."

"tl;dr: My partner wants me to pay for the prescription cat food our vet prescribed because he thinks I overreacted to the cat pooping in the bathtub and in the dining room over the course of multiple days for the last month. I feel unappreciated. How do I handle this?

My (41 NB) cat died earlier in the spring at the age of 13 after his kidney failed. He was my cat from before I met my partner (29 M) but quickly won my partner over because he was really one the sweetest, gentlest cats I have ever had. The problem was, in his last year of life, vet bills really racked up, into the thousands, largely pocketed by me because I was really unwilling to part from him until I was sure it was his time, and it was pretty clear when it was time to let him go.

My partner initially didn't want to adopt a new cat right away because we still have an elderly dog we nearly lost this year as well, he's going back to school and so it has been a financial burden keeping him alive, and I was fine with that because I was still grieving my cat anyway. Late this spring, though, he started really missing having a cat around, so he and I went to a local rescue and fell in love with a little tabby-calico mix (1 1/2 F) who came from a hoarding situation.

Overall, she's been a great cat, but the one thing I've struggled with over the month we've had her is that she poops in the bathtub and that it isn't solid. This combination led me to wonder if it is medical since I had a cat when I was a kid who did this when she had a UTI.

My partner thought I was overreacting and didn't want me to take her to the vet, but I insisted after she pooped in the middle of the dining room floor.

At the vet, we found out she has no parasites, but he wants us to try a combination of behavioral changes (such as adding an additional litter box) and a prescription cat food to see if it will clear up the consistency of the poop.

When I told my partner, he was frustrated and told me that I'm making a deal over something that's minor. The thing is, with him working third shift and going to school, cleaning the house usually falls to me, which is something I don't mind since he does a lot of cooking. But I'm feeling really resentful that he sees this as no big deal since I'm usually the one who cleans up poop in the bathtub at least once a day.

He told me that he would agree to clean up the poop, which is something he can't seriously commit to because I work from home and would have to be in a home with cat poop in the open and even shower in it if I were to just leave it for him all the time. He got frustrated and told me I'm paying for the prescription food if I think it's so necessary.

I'm feeling very upset right now because I really don't think it's normal for a cat to poop this much outside the litterbox but I feel very unsupported in trying to get her to stop, and I feel this is part of a larger issue about usually being the one who doesn't minimalize when something is wrong with the animals.

How can I approach this that both acknowledges his anxiety about finances while also pushing that a cat acting this way is not normal medically or behaviorally? I don't want to potentially spend 15 years with a cat that poops everywhere, especially if it can be easily corrected.

To be clear, I'm not thinking of getting rid of the cat. That's not on the table because it's not her fault. But I also don't think simply letting her poop everywhere is an acceptable solution.

EDIT: I'm not sure how clear I made it because I'm a little upset right now, but I think my frustration comes around his minimization of the cat's issue and his ultimatum that I would need to pay for it all. This is a common pattern for him with money: completely panicking over unexpected expenses and picking anxious fights about it.",Follow the vets advice not your partners.
"Hi there
So my girlfriend an I are together for 3 years, and I love her dearly.
When it's just us, my girlfriend talks in a playful baby voice and starts talking nonsense like a child would.
In the beginning it was kinda cute, but overtime it started to annoy me more and more. Now I kinda can't stand it.

You've been together for three years.  Eventually you're going to have to learn how to talk to her about things that might be upsetting to one or both of you.  That might as well be now.

"How to stop being a pessimist. I don't know if this is a common problem with a lot of people on here, and just googling the issue showed me 20,000 websites that pretty much just said take deep breaths, so here I am.



I wanted to know if anyone had any tips/techniques from personal experience to stop being pessimistic. Personally, it is a problem that has damaged a few relationships of mine and I really want to mature past this. My main problem is that whenever small bad/unlucky things, I just go from 0 to 100 angry/frustrated wise. When something uncommon happens, like when I got mugged, it didn't even faze me. I just moved on and told people that whoever did it, I hope that they had no other way and that things get better for them. However, if I spill my glass of juice in the morning, I will explode in rage, and it will ruin my day. Not only that, but I have a hard time moving on from any type of failures (relationships, exams, ect). I just obsess about it non-stop and it puts me in a bad mood. It has caused problems at work, because if my email refuses to load and I have to take 10 minutes to reboot my computer, it just kills my mood and makes me less approachable.


I don't believe I'm a bad person, I just let the little things get to me too easily.

"TL;DR : I (F33) had a date with a (M40) that left me feeling really disregarded, need some help figuring out if I'm overreacting or if I should avoid this person.


So I'm someone who used to date a lot but I've barely seen anyone during the last few years because of covid and really shitty mental health. I also used to have a really easy and fun sexuality, but found out more recently that I have a bit more trouble enjoying myself and that random hookups with a new person make me nervous and aren't the most satisfying. It's not trauma related or anything, I think it's just me being older, brain meds and self-doubt.

I feel some kind of way about that, like, having meh sex makes me feel like my body doesn't work the way I want it to anymore. I really miss how carefree and fun sex used to be for me, it used to be a big part of my life and I feel robbed of a part of myself. I know I can still feel desire and pleasure but when I'm with a partner and can't access that it really gets me down.

I've been in a bit of a better place mentally in general though and I've started socialising a lot more, which is good.

I recently met a cute guy I like. We connected pretty well and had a date last weekend where we had a really fun make out session, it was unexpected for me but I really enjoyed myself. He's a little nervous and awkward at times but honestly so am I.

A possible yellow flag is that he's in one of these ""open"" relationships where they both date other people but his partner doesn't want to know anything. Not my favourite situation but I'm not looking for something serious and it's unlikely I would ever meet his partner. (Edit) to clarify, I am also poly, comfortable with my single life ATM and would mostly like a nice FWB situation.

We planned a 2nd date today at my place. Yesterday he messaged me saying he wasn't sure he could make it because he got some bad news from a close friend and wasn't in the best headspace. (I found out later it involves a very sick child so I can understand). I told him we could of course reschedule, but he eventually decided to come over anyway. 

We had coffee and a really nice chat but he did check his phone a few times and let me know he'd need to call his friend later in the evening. We made out again, which eventually led to sex. The making out and foreplay part was fun, but when we had sex it was really rushed and kinda rough and lasted for like a couple minutes.

I was pretty confused. He said he felt like I wasn't enjoying myself as much once we started penetration and so he tried to make it quick. I told him I wasn't sure why he would think that and I'd actually have liked to take it slow and enjoy myself. I'd have felt fine if he'd taken a bit of time to take care of me afterwards but instead he got really nervous and apologetic for misjudging the situation.

I think he felt pretty overwhelmed because he had to call his friend soon and at the same time he felt like he messed up and could see I was confused and kind of upset. He left quickly after that, I asked if he could call his friend and then maybe we could chill together for a bit but he said he wouldn't be feeling okay afterwards, so he just went away.

He messaged me once he got home to apologise again, said he wouldn't bother me if I didn't want to but he'd like to see me again. I'm just feeling kind of angry and really shit about myself. At the same time I get being an anxious person and I understand the situation with his friend would be pretty overwhelming so I don't want to be callous.

I haven't replied to his message yet. I'm having difficulty judging if I feel like shit because of my own baggage or if he acted badly towards me. Right now I kind of want to get mad or just ghost him, but at the same time I don't often meet someone I have good chemistry with. I don't know if I should give him a chance or if he's inconsiderate and too much drama.","The part the weirds me out is that when he thought you weren’t enjoying it, his answer was to keep going. He thought you were upset but didn’t talk about it but also didn’t stop pounding away either. That’s gross. He sounds like a shitty partner."

"When a friend is sick or in need, I’m (19F) willing to help out however and I always message or call to let them know that.

I recently messaged a friend (22M) who was sick to let them know I was happy to help out or stop at the store if they need anything. We’re in college so not everyone has family here and there’s a lot of stores in walking distance of us, so I didn’t think much of it.

He respectfully declined and made it a point that I realize his girlfriend was caring for him (all really respectfully and kindly). I said I was glad to hear it and wished him a speedy recovery.

But now I’m worried it often seems like I’m overstepping? 

I’ve had guys often hit on me in a “testing the waters” type sense when I had no interest in them, so I worry I sometimes give off the wrong vibe when I genuinely just want to help out. 

I’m especially worried about giving this vibe off f to my taken guy friends as I truly don’t want to disrespect any relationship.  I have a feeling I’ve given offf this vibe before (except I usually don’t realize maybe I overstepped until after the fact :/), but I think the girlfriends usually let it slide because I’m usually just as good friends with the girl and they know I’d do the same thing for them hence why I’ve gone unconfronted, but I neeed to get a better sense of boundaries because of situations like today where someone might get the wrong vibe or bc I won’t always know the girlfriend and she might not know my intentions.

Part of my issue is that my texts are lengthy and. That can definitely give an overbearing and care too much vibe— I’m working on that

This is particularly an issue with my guy friends, my girl friends always understand my intentions.

Anyways, When is too much to do for a friend? How do you let your friends know you’re there for them without seeming overbearing? 

Obviously no one can give me hard and fast rules but if you have any helpful cues or tips to help me tread water more carefully, I’d appreciate it.

tl;dr 

guys (&amp; sometimes their girlfriends) often misunderstand my platonic intentions when I try to support them (e.g. when sick or stressed). Any tips to recognize &amp; respect their emotional boundaries?

"Yes I know I don't have any karma and its a new account, I made a throwaway account specifically so I could post this.

I (35M) have been with my girlfriend(39F) for just over a year. Things were very good early on but have been sliding the last 2 months. She's very sweet, and very supportive, as I am with her. Often times though when she is stressed or frustrated with something such as work, family, friends, she has a tendency to take the frustration out on me. Not in a physical way mind you, but she vents at me, and not to me. Gets cranky and flustered at me. I have addressed it but as soon as I do, its like getting punched and then her saying I'm sorry.

Another thing that struck a nerve with me was when I talked to her mother on the phone about a week ago. I had mentioned I was concerned about my girlfriends mental health and asked if she had talked ever talked to a professional. Her mother told me she had when ""she was going through her affair"". Now, I was told by my girlfriend that her ex husband was having an affair, and started talking to another guy out of spite. But if she was having the affair first, that's a whole different story.

The big problem came last week, and I have not addressed it yet, but intend to. Her and I drove to pick my mom up at the airport, and while we were driving back to our place, a message popped up on her screen in my car from the name ""James"". My eyes instantly darted off the road and to her phone that was in her lap, and the message said ""So are we still on for drinks sometime?"" I tried not to make it obvious I had seen the message on her phone, so I asked her ""who's James?"" She said ""that's my gay best friend"". She has mentioned one of her friends is gay, but I have yet to meet him in person. Regardless of whether he is gay or not, the fact that she's been planning to go out for drinks with someone of the opposite sex and not telling me really rubs me the wrong way. I keep asking myself how she would feel if I had a female friend who wanted to go for drinks without me telling her and even if they were gay, she would be pissed. The orientation doesn't matter. I feel she has been hiding this from me and its seriously not okay.

I was not snooping, but I found some communication from her when I was looking at his email for payment confirmation for a bill that we had paid. 

Following this, I checked his phone and found more evidence of contact between them. 

While I am glad that he refused to meet her face to face, I am concerned that he has been interacting with her and didn't tell me.

How should I confront him and tell him that he must stop all contact with her?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My husband is in regular contact with his ex and I want advice on how to put a stop to it.","For those saying what's OP's issues, the ex is saying she still loves OP's husband and misses him.

He hasn't responded to that but regrets what happened/how it ended.

OP you should probably put that in your post, so you'd get a more rounded response.

So yes I would have issues with him being in contact with his ex on that basis. He should be shutting that down and cutting contact, there is no reason to continue a conversation.

He may regret how it ended, if it ended badly, but that doesn't mean he wants to get back with her. If it ended badly because of him he may have some unresolved guilt about the situation.

You need to talk to him and be open, because he's definitely not doing it with you. Maybe because he doesn't want to upset you, but by not being open with you he's creating anxiety and doubt that will just fester. I'm guessing your trust in him has taken a knock because of this and you need to tell him that.

If he tells you you're overreacting/snooping etc and doesn't show any concern for your feelings then I would suggest taking a good look at your relationship, but give him a chance to explain first.

Good luck"

Would it make sense to approach the current employer with this information and ask if they can match the offer? Or just take the offer and resign from the current employer. My understanding is that the motivation for leaving the current employer is only the salary. The work environment and the work itself and potential for promotion are there. My suggestion would be to approach the manager during the 1:1 say that you have received this offer and say that you are currently enjoying the work but the salary is not competitive anymore.

"My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn’t paying rent. Should I break up?
I (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad’s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she’d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and got her a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. 

I kind of became suspicious when she didn’t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn’t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. 

During the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I’m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.

Last summer we went on a roadtrip where I payed for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn’t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only payed rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn’t afford it. 

To be clear, it’s not about the money but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?","If she stopped paying rent why are you posting on Reddit and not sitting down with her is my first thought. Rents due can I have your half please?

No offer to cover the difference. If she can't afford it then why not? She knows it's due at the end of the month.

"Sorry this is so long-winded,

tl;dr : He is now wishy washy about marriage and I told him that is what I want or we should go separate ways. Complicated by our adorable oopsie baby and logistics of our families living far apart. I also love him and care about him a lot but don't want to suck it up and end up resenting him.

Context: him and I have been together 2.5 years. We live close to his family. My family and friends live about a 20hr drive away. We were friends prior and I moved up here for work. We moved in together pretty quickly (he had just sold his house and I was relocating-so timing and convenience were a factor). We then purchased a house together last year. We still have separate finances. I am the higher earner by quite a bit. Neither of us was certain we wanted kids or marriage and it wasn’t something we were thinking about doing in the near future.

Surprise, I got pregnant. Despite birth control and condoms. We were both very surprised and in shock but I was more distressed about the pregnancy. He quickly became excited about it and being a dad. We decided together to continue with the pregnancy. We discussed marriage during the pregnancy. He “jokingly” proposed to me with a candy ring. He later made it clear this was a joke. I discussed with him that it is important to me that I share a last name with my child and that if marriage wasn’t something he wanted to move forward with, we wouldn’t give the baby only his last name. He assured me this was something he wanted and we discussed moving forward with this after the baby was born. He was clear on my reasoning for this being what I want: I do love him very much, I want to be a family and that is what family looks like a means to me, I do see that as the ultimate way to demonstrate commitment and don’t want to be with someone who isn’t 100% sure of their feelings for me and our relationship, the state we are in does not recognize common-law relationships, last name, etc.,

Fast forward to now, our baby is 6 months old and we have had this conversation again (3 times in the last few months) about our relationship progressing and having a shared vision for the future. He is now saying he doesn’t understand why it needs to be on my timeline and that it doesn’t make sense because he thought we were progressing. He has said it is something he wants but why does it have to be now.

A month or so ago, I brought it up and gave him an out. I told him that it is okay if we have different goals and timelines but that he needs to be honest with me so we can both move forward, together or apart. He is aware I wouldn’t keep our child from him or anything like that. He said it is something he wanted. I told him that his words need to be followed up with actions or they don’t hold weight. I told him that I’m not waiting around as that would lead to resentment and I don’t want a relationship or home with unhappy parents for my son to grow up in. He said he would act. Nothing came of this.

I brought it up last night. I told him nothing has changed and that speaks volumes. I told him it’s clear to me that we are not on the same page and that it is okay. I told him without a shared vision of the future and what we want, our relationship can’t move forward. I also told him I deserve someone that knows what they want and is excited to be with me and be a family. I acknowledged that nothing about our situation is normal or traditional and things would be different without a baby but here we are. I gave him the opportunity to show me different but he got upset saying it “isn’t fair” and “what did he do wrong” and “he doesn’t want it to be this way”.

This situation is obviously complicated as I want to move closer to be near my family if we are not together and figuring out what that would look like with our child is a lot. I had a really bad pregnancy with complications, preterm baby and severe post Partum depression. Our baby is great now…pretty calm and content, has been sleeping through the night for a while and things overall have improved. So we are out of the newborn craziness. He is a great dad and is very caring and does a lot for me. To be clear, I am not saying we need to get married tomorrow and neither of us are on board with dumping money into a wedding (hello college fund for baby). I am asking for a concrete action that shows intent and that we are moving in that direction.

If not then don't say anything and continue enjoying their company (but understand if you do see other people and they find out it will probably sabotage chances of that relationship becoming serious).  If you want to be exclusive then as an adult you don't have to beat around the bush.  Ask your partner how they feel about dating you exclusively.  After a few weeks of that if it feels like you're becoming more serious then you may want to start talking about the relationship label.

Keep in mind that you can't expect people to date you exclusively until you actually agree to that.  If you're not serious then don't ask for them to be serious in return.

"Boyfriend doesn’t want a wedding because he thinks it will make his dad look bad

My (26f) boyfriend (27m) of four and a half years says he wants to marry me but doesn’t want a wedding. Background: we’ve been living together for two years and have an otherwise amazing relationship. He does not have a relationship with his dad (his only parent), but seems to want to establish one even though this man is pushing him away and keeps treating him with utter disrespect.

We’ve been talking about marriage and our timelines/plans practically since we started dating. We both initially wanted a big wedding after I was done with grad school (2021) but then we realized we weren’t in a rush to get married and obviously didn’t make any plans because of Covid-related restrictions. 

This year right after New Year’s he says 2022 would be a good year to get married. We talk about it briefly, and then I didn’t bring it up again because I was expecting a proposal.

By mid-April I realized there would be no way to have the wedding we had talked about in 2022. I bring it up and he says his relationship with his dad is making him feel depressed and he needs time to deal with his feelings. I let it go but remind him that if we do plan on having a wedding we need to at least set a date (I propose summer 2023) because many of our family members we’d want there live abroad and need plenty of time to make plans.

In July he drunkenly tells me that his dad disapproves of our relationship because he doesn’t like my family (he doesn’t know any of us directly), and that this has been weighing on him. I thought okay, he didn’t want to get married before sharing this with me and don’t think much of it.

Come September I finally bring it up and ask what’s happening. He tells me he wants to get married but doesn’t want a wedding.

He wants our closest people there but not his dad and he doesn’t feel comfortable having a huge wedding because people would talk about his dad being absent and even though they do not have a relationship he wants to protect him from the humiliation.

I believe he wants to marry me because he’s been trying to convince me to do a civil ceremony ASAP because we talked about starting a family and making big purchases (car, home). He is however adamant about not wanting a wedding.

Bear in mind we come from a culture (Eastern Europe) where huge weddings (300+) people are the norm and family is usually very involved.

I told him I would feel humiliated if he chose not to have the wedding we’ve been planning for over 3 years (and have told people about) because he is protective of his father’s feelings and public opinion over his absence, especially when this man doesn’t even know me and is against me.

I feel so disappointed and hurt that I am considering breaking up with him. Talking about the wedding so much has made me not even want one, ever, because it would feel forced.

I just want him to want to choose me over anyone.

Any perspective would be highly appreciated.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend of over four years wants to get married and start a family but doesn’t want a wedding because he thinks it will hurt his estranged father’s public image.",The problem I see here is that his father’s feelings and opinions are driving all the decisions he makes. It’s fine not to want a big wedding or no wedding at all but that should be a decision you make together and not based on his father. How many other decisions is he going to base on his father. At some point we all have to grow up and live our own lives despite what our parents think. This is an issue that will come up again and again. Best hash it out now.
"i’ve (18m) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (18f) for over a year and for a long time i would suppress my discomfort about her wearing revealing clothes as i thought i was being stupid and though i was just being insecure. I have no doubt in my mind that my partner would stay loyal no matter what she’s wearing or where she is. But i’ve always questioned as to why she wants to wear stuff like that so much. Like whenever i ask her about it and in general, i get the response of “i’m doing it for myself” or “it makes me feel good/confident.” which is great, but also sometimes it doesn’t make sense to me. for instance if she posts it online then, clearly it’s not for herself it’s for other people. same story if she goes out to a club, i mean it’s her friends n other guys/girls seeing it. and i just wanna know if my discomfort with this is wrong or if its about preference. cus i would never ever tell her to stop doing what she likes. but i wanna look out for myself as well n if this makes her happy n makes me uncomfortable then i don’t think we’re right for each other. please help me out here…

tl;dr! : my girlfriend likes to wear revealing clothes, and i don’t want to control her or restrict her but have a difficult time understanding what she enjoys about it so much.",She likes feeling attractive. It’s really not that complicated. Do you not want her to be/feel attractive anymore now that she’s with you? Why would you choose someone to date and want them to change as soon as they’re with you? It’d make more sense to just date a girl who wears less revealing clothes from the start.
"How do I calm down quickly and think rationally when I get affected by something? I am an over thinker, and am quite sensitive towards what others tell me, and I find it happening more at more at work recently. When something is said to trigger my sensitivity, I would dwell on it, get upset over it and think about it non stop, thinking of all the possible scenarios that might have could have caused them to say that. 

I’ve tried to take deep breaths, walk away, but I lose a disgusting amount of sleep over it. I will usually calm down after a lot of effort in 5-7 days after the incident.

Does anyone have any recommendations on how I can speed up this process?","Howdy, I'm a therapist that specializes in trauma and suicide. One of the best things to do really is to *just breathe* to regulate the nervous system, but as one of my teen clients put it, ""that's condescending as fuck in the moment."" It can also send people spiraling further if they have CPTSD/haven't had the opportunity (yet!) to develop the capacity to self-soothe or are otherwise dysregulated to the point where bringing focus more internally is just not a great option (like with clients with chronic pain or strong physical anxiety/trauma). So if breathing exercises aren't on the table, the best advice I have is the classic external exercise of 5-4-3-2-1 grounding:

&#x200B;

5 - things you can see

4 - things you can feel

3 - things you can hear

2 - things you can smell

1 - taste/name something positive about yourself

&#x200B;

In my personal life I'm a nerd so beyond breathing exercises, like box breathing, I like to hum the ABC's or something since humming relaxes the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is stimulated when your system is dysregulated for whatever reason and it can set off more biological reactions that wig you out even further. Also a big fan of literal grounding like laying down on the floor and relaxing into it. I do that between sessions sometimes.

Really anything that can regulate your system more will bring more of your executive functioning back online, so petting pets, playing with fidgets, putting on warmer or cooler clothes, or doing anything mindfully. DBT skills are great to learn for this reason. We are also contextually created people, so removing yourself from your present environment/stressor if you feel yourself starting to get activated (whatever that means for you, I usually notice myself getting more agitated or my stomach starting to ache) can do wonders. Hope this helps!"
"what do I need to do before I move out at 17 years old? I'm moving out in 3 months,  and I'm not sure what affairs I need to get in order. I am getting all my medical things taken care of,  my parents are giving a power of attorney to my sister whom I'll be living with,  and I've decided against getting my drivers license due to insurance reasons.  Is there anything else I need to get in order?","Hopefully you're close to your 18th birthday. Otherwise, having to ring your parents for document signing is going to get very old, very quick. yes, I know your sister has PoA. There are limits to those, sometimes severe ones.

That said, some general tips:

1) Get a drivers license. Seriously. You don't need insurance if you don't have a car, but having a license makes it easier to borrow one, and once you're an adult, rent one, on an as-needed basis. It doubles as official ID.

2) Know the limits on that power of attorney doc. It will vary from place to place. 

3) Get a job. Seriously. You're going to need money of some sort. Just living at your sisters place on your parents dime will get really old, really fast, for her. (Possibly you as well.) You don't need much, but you need something.
4) Make your bed, clean your room, do your dishes, take out the trash, pay your bills on time, balance your budget, etc. All those things. They're chores. They're no fun. Do them anyways. Do them on a regular basis, so they become life-long good habits. 

5) Help out around the place. You're going to be a long-term guest in your sisters place. Emotions are going to get on each others nerves. Being genuinely helpful around the house will help keep that stuff under control. It will still happen, but it won't be as bad. It'll also reinforce the good habits I referenced above.

6) Get out of the house! Go be out there. See the world. Don't spend all your time at home playing video games/watching TV/whatever.

7) Spend time IN the house, but out of your room. Be social with the people you live with. Play cards together. Pick a TV show to watch through together, something you do on a regular basis.

8) Cook your own meals/Help out with meal prep. Yes, going out for a burger is fast and easy. It also is expensive and will do nothing for your health. You're young, you won't notice it for a few years, but it will happen.

9) If you've got someone you want to bring home for the night, give sis a heads up BEFORE hand. You really don't want her screaming at the person first thing Saturday morning while you're taking a leak.

10) Know that she'll worry about you. Text/call/whatever, so she knows where you're at and what's going on. She'll likely be giving updates on you to your parents. You want them to know what's up too.

11) Write/call/etc your mom and dad. Seriously. They're helping make this happen. They want you to succeed. Make sure you work to keep them involved in your life.

12) Save as much money as you can, without being a scrooge about it. Contribute to the household bills.

13) Know that you're going to make mistakes. Be prepared to own the mistakes, apologize for them, and work to not make them again.

Other than that, you're going to be moving out. The world is opening up for you. Enjoy the occasional friday night pizza, but save some for breakfast saturday morning."
"First timer here. I'm at the fence on this one so I think getting outward comments may help me out a lot. So here I go.

I'm 26M, Mom 45F, My sister, 19F and youngest brother 9M.

My dad passed away 5 years ago. Before he passed on, he left us A home and a piece of land that he put it under my name, the house was on my mom's name. We were in debt(not a lot) The land was bigger than the house.  After my dad passed away, I had a talk with my mom. We decided it was best to sell the house(decent 6 figures) and pay off debts, finish my studies and try to build another house in that barren land. That area was developing and value was going up. My mom is a 3 time Stroke survivor who's now in a wheelchair because she had an accident few months ago.

I joined work soon after my dad's death. I have an uncle I'm close to and with his help, I was able to construct a 3 storied building. We rented out 2 and moved in one.  As dad was NOT around anymore, I decided that it was not fair that I get the building all by myself. My mom and dad had a love marriage. Mom was devastated and talked me about my sibling's future. I assured her that it was my responsibility now to take care of my siblings and her. I was talking to split the building in future.

 Here is the problem. My sister considered her a disney princess. Won't lift a finger, blast loud music we received noise complaints, will disrespect mom and me. Continuously ask for money even though we give her an allowance. She's friends with my ex gf who cheated on me. She knew but decided not to tell me because ""it's cool and happens all the time""

I ultimately decided that if she wanted to stay, she must cease disrespecting me and mom inside my house. She yelled that it was her house too as Dad left it. I told her dad left it land, I made it home. I gave her and ultimatum that she needs to move out by next year. Mom is saddened by it. We are immigrants in this country. Mom is worried about her safety and doesn't want her to leave. I told her that she must. I can't take the disrespect anymore. I told her that I will try to find some work for her so she can at least try to make a living instead of living off my money and yelling at me. 


I pay for literally everything. Taxes, Bills, Groceries, Loan repayments, education, car loan. I can't afford to give her 1.2k each month to spend lavishly. My sister told me that my GF was right to cheat on an asshole like me. Mom tells me she's worried and I might have gone a bit out of line with asking her to move out. I don't know the right course of action I should take now. She's becoming a spoilt child. She tells me she needs her own car and I told her to work for one. Is there any way I can handle this without having to hurt anyone?

Tl;dr: My younger sister disrespected me and mom in my house. I told her she needs to move out but I think it was not right because this land belongs to our dad and I feel I'm being an asshole about it. Can I handle this without a conflict?","I don't understand why she is given an allowance at all... If you don't want to go to the extreme of kicking her out but you are worried about her continuing to act like a spoiled brat, tell her to get a job because she is being cut off.

Providing her a roof over her head and food in the fridge is all she needs, everything else is a luxury. You're the one (as a sibling not a parent) providing her unnecessary luxury. I don't know why she got an allowance in the first place, but now she is abusing it because she doesn't see the true value of the hard work put in to making that money.

I personally never got an allowance and my parents are well off. I got a part time job in high school, then went to college (paying 90% of it on my own). I know how hard you have to work to get nice things. But I still could not survive without my parents help to put a roof over my head in this economy...

She is acting like a child, so treat her as one. If she is disrespecting the household (and tenants) by playing loud music, take away her speaker, etc. Your mom and you need to get on the same page with this."
"How to tactfully get out of political/religious/other controversial discussions with family or other pushy people. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem or potential problem.  My political and nonreligious views starkly contrast those of my immediate family, and presidential campaign season is in full swing.  When talking to most people, if they try to bring up religion or politics you can usually dismiss the topic fairly easily simply by saying you don't want to talk about it, you're not comfortable with it, or you don't really have an opinion.  However, when dealing with anyone who has a vested interest in the topic and/or you as a person, it's much more challenging.  I'll use my own situation as an example.  If my dad were to ask me something as simple as ""who are you voting for in the primaries,"" I don't see any good options: If I tell him what I actually think, it'll start a debate and I'm extremely non-confrontational (trying to argue with me will get you a deer in headlights reaction and an emotional meltdown if the demand for argument continues past that point), and the rest of my family would look down on me for committing wrongthink.  If I say I don't know/have an opinion he'll insist that it's a very simple matter to learn about the various candidates and make a decision (which isn't all wrong) and that I'm lazy and shirking my duty as a US citizen to be an informed political participant.  If I say I don't care, I'll get much the same response as not having an opinion but harsher, since having an active disinterest in politics would be worse than just not knowing what to think.  If I try to say that I don't want to/am not comfortable with having such a discussion, that will throw up a big red flag and lead to targeted, probing questions directed at me.  I can't think of any good way out of this scenario and all of the ways I can think of require lying, something I'm also not comfortable with but admittedly is better than confrontation.","I'm often in the same boat that you are. What I usually do I say something along the lines of ""I'm still trying to learn more about it to figure out my thoughts on it. What do YOU think about XYZ?"" Most times, all your ""pushy listener"" really wants to do is talk about what they think. Just throw them a bone and let them ramble on to avoid conflict."
"I got blackout drunk last Friday. We went to a friend's house, had a party there, then I got back home with a friend.

We took a bus back home at like 3am, then BAM it's Saturday at noon and we woke up on the ground, sunburned to shit, in a plot of land a few blocks from my house. I don't remember ANYTHING after taking the bus, but my friend remembers a few things and basically I told her to cut through the plot and eventually pulled her to the floor to rest and we both fell asleep.

My parents had already called the cops and I had like 70 messages and calls from them. Mom yelled at us in tears that she feared I was dead and it was the worst night of her life.

Later mom and dad told me I was grounded ""forever"" and that I will do nothing more than go to school and back home ""until they say so"", and that they will be always monitoring my location with an app.

At home they've been basically barking instructions at me whenever I have to do a chore and go on rants if I tell them to not speak to me like that. On Tuesday I tried to take a different bus back home from school because the app said a nearby bus was passing sooner and they blew up my phone before I had even walked the 2 blocks between the stops and ranted at me about it for like an hour that night.

My sister can't even talk to me without mom thinking the worst. Last night, we were talking in her room and mom busted in and questioned me like I was planning to rapel down the window.

They've been telling me about how they already canceled summer camp for me, how I'm gonna do NOTHING but stay at home for the rest of the year, to forget about going out with friends, etc.

I'm actually scared of them right now. They basically only ever yell at me and I can't say anything because they'll go on a tirade for 10 minutes.

How to tell them that, OK, whatever, RIP my life outside home but to maybe tone it down with the rest of... everything?

I've tried telling them that I'm feeling really scared of them and they don't let me say anything. Mom basically busts my door open at 10pm to tell me it's time to go to bed and doesn't even let me shut down my laptop or brush my teeth, just jump straight to bed.

How to get them to at least stop treating me like this? 

**tl;dr:** Got blackout drunk, was missing for 12 hours because I passed out on my way back home. Parents grounded me and are being insanely controlling and yelling at me basically every time they talk to me. I want them to at least stop treating me like this but they won't even let me speak. What do I do?","What did you learn? You are lucky to be alive. You could have died in your sleep. My friend got black out drunk and choked on his on vomit. He died at 22. You live in a large city. Someone could have seen you and taken you. You put yourself in a vulnerable situation. 

They are scared bc they almost lost you due to your recklessness. They got to live their greatest fear of their life for 12 hours. It’s like pulling someone out of their safe reality then sending them spiraling into a hell dimension where they get to imagine the worst thing they can think of for 12 hours. While you peacefully slumber in a field. Are they handling it well? No. 

What have you done to reconcile the situation? Have you wrote an apology? Have you asked to volunteer or done anything where you have to think about others before yourself?"
How do I overcome my fear of conflicts? I fear driving because some other drivers raging. I fear telling my neighbors to shut up when they're partying all night long on weekdays.. etc. How do I overcome this?,"Desensitize. Start with easy(ier) things like talking to a stranger, doing little things to draw attention to yourself in public, or role-playing/play-arguing with a friend you trust. Once you get on a roll you'll start to like it."
"Friends GF always talking about my ex? So I don't know if it's a typical bitchy thing that women do, or whether she just doesn't have other friends or interesting things to talk about but it seems my friend's GF has somewhat enjoyment of mentioning my Ex (of 5 years) whenever she can.
- They weren't friends before, and have only really 'known' each other for less than a year so they aren't even close. 
- Her topics are always mundane AF. (makeup, my ex, exams or some irrelevant nonsense that no one really cares to hear about)
- She talks about my ex on a regular basis, mentioning (again) mundane things like ""oh ___ and I are going shopping this weekend"", ""___ is writing a 6 hour exam today"", ""I want to plan a girls night out and invite ___"".

Need some advice here. I try ignore it, keep to myself and I think she's gotten the point so far because she's stopped talking to me about it, but now she's started talking to my friends about it while I'm present.","Have you talked to her about it? There are lots of possible reasons she might be doing that. If you just honestly say hey, do you mind not talking about X in front of me anymore? Then she will probably stop. Don't get petty like the other responses are telling you to do."
How to stay happy when something bad just happened? For example: a loved one arguing with you or someone bullies or disrespects you. How do you jump back up from that and not let it ruin your day or upcoming days?,"A lot of answers focused on your specific ask, but I want to say that it’s normal and healthy to feel a wide range of emotions (angry, frustrated, sad, etc.) following a situation like your example. 

I think everyone should give themselves time to process these things in quiet reflection - how it made you feel, why it made you feel the way it did, will you do anything about it or leave it be and move on. 

After that time is up, I find chores to be an effective stress reliever and mental palate cleanser."
"Please hear me out. I know it sounds bad. 

I work in a creative field with a lot of young people. One grew close to me, a younger man who is just now starting his career, fresh out of school. 

He kept flirting with me while we were together at work, and I resisted b/c of the significant age gap and b/c I knew he had a g/f (F21); I had seen them together at an event. 

He enjoys smoking marijuana, which his girlfriend HATES. 

I don't smoke it like I used to, but I don't mind if others do, and I understand how powerful a tool it can be for the creative process. We start hanging out and smoking together. He brings it over. He wants to come by and smoke it when his g/f ""won't let him."" 

We work on music together... art, photography, videos; we really start to bond. We don't just get high and hang out; we go places together, we make meals with each other, we talk about our goals &amp; dreams; I want to show him and teach him all that I know about what he's interested in. 

The girlfriend gets angry with him because she hates the pot and wants him to get out of the creative field he went to school for and get a ""real job,"" like HVAC or plumbing like her Dad does. When she's really mad, she runs back to her ex, which tears my friend apart.


At first we just stay friends and it's cool.

 I realize a lot of my feelings are probably maternal towards him; I can tell he hasn't been exposed to a lot of the world, or to that much higher culture, and I want to teach him things and make his life easier, b/c I see that he's very talented.

One night, while he and the g/f are experiencing one of their ""breaks,"" things go a little too far. 

He wants me to come see some renovations he's been doing on his house (he's redoing an old place of his father's). After the general tour, he says he wants to show me something special in the bedroom (uh oh) and lies down on the bed and asks me lay beside him and look up at a skylight he's put in, to ""look at the stars.""

We lay there for what seems like an eternity, staring into each other's eyes (I know, it's SO cheesy), sighing, and then finally we start to kiss.

 But I get up and stop it, saying, ""This is wrong. We really shouldn't do this."" 

He seems disappointed but not upset. He doesn't push it. 

We stay away texting and phone wise for a couple weeks after this, but still see each other at work and are just as friendly as ever. 

One day he comes up to me and says he has to talk to me. 

We get off work and go to my place, where he starts crying and saying his girlfriend is pregnant and he doesn't know what to do.

That he doesn't really love her, he thinks he loves *me,* and he isn't sure if the baby is his or her ex's, since they've gone ""back and forth"" so much. 

I can't lie, I have strong feelings for this man, despite his youth. 

I feel very SEEN and appreciated when I'm with him, like he's almost dazzled by me, whereas usually I'm the one begging for more attention in a relationship. 

I know that's selfish, but I want advice and I'm keeping it real. So a part of me, NGL, is thrilled. 

But then I think ""SHE'S PREGNANT. OH DEAR LORD HOW CAN YOU DO THIS, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?""

Then, much to my shock and horror,  *I* start to cry and admit to him that I've imagined myself with him, too, but that a part of what attracts me to him is me knowing what a good guy I know he is, deep down inside,  and that good guys don't walk away from their responsibilities. 

I cannot ask him to abandon his g/f, who may be carrying his child, just  to have him be with me, because that's selfish and wrong.

He says he understands and leaves. 


Well, now I'm miserable.

 I completely ignore him at work and he looks extremely hurt. He texts me, and I either don't text back or give minimal, spartan replies. If he calls, I don't pick up. 

I'm dying to know what's going on with him and her and I miss him like crazy, but feel like I'm doing the ""honorable"" thing. 

But the ""honorable"" thing has made me more depressed than I ever thought. Like, I'm surprised by how much this has affected me. 

What should I do? 

Stay distant and move on?

TL;DR: Much younger friend I had strong bond  with now has pregnant girlfriend but wants to be with me. Don't know what to do; I miss him.","It sounds bad because it's bad. Hearing you out only re-affirms this.

Not only are you toxic, but you're also boarding on predatory.  

You're not just selfish. You're deluded.

You're not doing the ""honorable"" thing. You're doing the only possibly reasonable and sane thing.

You need to speak to a therapist about your self-destructive behaviors and the fantasy you build up around this young man. Life is not a soap opera. Stop trying to follow some bizzaro day-time TV script."
"My boyfriend refuses to have sex when I'm drunk, even though I've told him many times that drinking makes me horny and I 100% consent beforehand, but no, he doesn't like it and doesn't want to touch me intimately when I've drunk.

Most times I drink the most and he's sober as he doesn't drink much.

It's extremely frustrating to be looking forward to sex at the end of the night and have him refuse, even though he himself wants to, but at the same time doesn't want to touch me because I'm drunk.

How do I get him to understand that *I want him when I'm drunk or tipsy*, and he's not violating my consent or whatever because I already gave it to him?

**tl;dr:** Boyfriend doesn't touch me sexually when I'm drunk because he thinks it breaks consent even though I WANT him to fuck me while I'm drunk. How to get him to understand?","As someone who used to drink a lot, and have a lot of drunk sex- first of all, I do understand where you are coming from. But now, as someone who doesn't drink that much, I also understand where your bf is coming from. Drunk people are messy and annoying, as horny as you are, (no offense, im sorry in advance) I feel like you being drunk is just a really big turn off for him. No real advice here except perhaps stop drinking so much"
"Please please please know that my boyfriend is a very good person and that I love him very much, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point because I can’t compete with his life anymore, and I really need some advice.

Full disclosure: My boyfriend and I moved very quickly in our relationship. It was the type of instant and intense “love at first sight” where it felt almost uncanny how similar we were..

I felt such an instant and intimate connection to him that I didn’t think twice about quitting my career and moving to a different state with him quite quickly, and despite that risk it actually worked out really well until recently.

I began noticing last winter that I felt more like an accessory to my boyfriend’s life, and that he seemed like he was still living a bachelor life. The first major fracture of our relationship was when he merged businesses with a friend on a whim and moved cities to go work with him, meaning that instead of being home every night like he normally was, he was gone 3-4 days a week. I won’t lie to say that I was furious. I wanted to be happy and supportive of his business decisions, but he made literally no effort in discussing this to me beforehand.

The next fracture came from something that I had signed up for willingly, but it has become a problem as I’ve grown to start feeling resentful. My boyfriend owns a business with his family, who he is extremely close with. All of his time when he is back home gets put into the family business. In the beginning, I was really enthusiastic about this business, and I would volunteer time to get to know his parents and the community better, but now I want nothing to do with it because it feels like there’s way too much expectation for me to engage with it.

His parents were very welcoming to me, and they entrusted me to do a lot with the business which I was happy to do, but now that my boyfriend is gone most of the week, it seems like even more of my time is being spent maintaining aspects of my boyfriend’s life instead of me trying to carve a place for myself in my new home.

Then there’s the problem that when my boyfriend is at home, all of his time goes into this family business, and so I feel even further away from the main cast of his life. Weirdly enough, now I’m much closer with my boyfriend’s sister than I am with my boyfriend, as her and I hang out and talk more than I do with him, which would be a lovely and beautiful thing if I also had that with my boyfriend, but instead I feel that if it weren’t for his sister supporting me, I’d be abandoned.

Finally the last major fracture is the dog we have together. Our dog is a highly energetic breed and requires a lot of attention and time. This was no issue in the beginning and the dog always felt naturally like “my dog” but it was the expectation that both my boyfriend and I would take care of her. Yet now our dog seems to have been back-seated, just like me. 

For example, if I’ve asked my boyfriend to watch the dog because I’m vacuuming or cooking or even want time by myself, he will take her for 20 minutes and then eventually lose concentration until she comes to find me in hopes I will play with her.

I actually had a bit of a freakout about this when my boyfriend and I were invited to a big family celebration a few weeks ago. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to bring the dog because she is way too excitable around people and I just wanted to focus on meeting some of his extended family and making a good first impression with them, since he is so close to his family. My boyfriend begged me to take the dog with us because he missed her.

I reluctantly agreed, only because he swore that “he would take care of her and that there would be a lot of other dogs there.” My boyfriend also promised he wouldn’t drink because my car was in the shop and we had to drive his vehicle, which is standard and something I can’t drive because I never learned how to drive stick. 

We show up, and embarrassingly we are the only people there with a dog. My boyfriend abandoned me almost immediately to spend time and to catch up with his family members, who I couldn’t meet because my dog is extremely excitable around people, so I have to stay in the outer circle of the fun with her so that she can remain relaxed. 

Worse yet is the hostess, and a few people who helped her set up, swung by and commented that “they were hoping that this would be a no-dog party” and that “they would make sure I know next time when dogs aren’t allowed” and it felt so awfully embarrassing to me that I nearly cried. 

There I was, all alone at a party where I don’t know anyone, with an animal tied to my hand which clearly was extremely unwelcomed, and to make it worse now looks like it was my idea because I’m hanging on the sidelines avoiding people instead of socializing.

Even more devastating was when I did finally find my boyfriend, he was already halfway to being drunk, to which he laughed and said to me “we can just take a taxi!” Through gritted teeth, I then told him “We can’t. We have the dog!” 

The only thing that saved us was my boyfriend’s extremely nice uncle, who I think was a mind reader or something. He came up to me, as I was nearly in tears and asked me how I was getting home. I explained the situation and he gave me the keys to his car so that me, the dog and my boyfriend could get home that night.

That last situation very much felt like the final straw and we had a massive blow out about it. It wasn’t the first conversation we had about this type of thing, and yet over and over and over again my boyfriend keeps telling me “I’m #1” and “tell me what to do so I can change.”

But I don’t want to be that person who is the dictator in someone else’s life and keep putting up ultimatums. I don’t want to have to feel like I’m competing with someone else’s life or like I have to explain to them how to treat me like a girlfriend instead of just some afterthought.

We had a conversation again last night where I told him I was unhappy, and I asked him if he understood why. I was hoping, praying, that from all of our conversations he would know. And yet all he could say was that he could tell I was unhappy in our relationship but he didn’t understand what for.

I went numb. It feels like if I walked out tomorrow nothing in his life would change, except maybe he wouldn’t have to have conversations anymore about how impossible it is to make me happy.

I just feel like an accessory and it hurts so bad.

Yet I still don’t know if this relationship is worth giving up because my boyfriend does love me and we align so well in our life goals. 

I finally broke down and spilled the beans to his sister, who calmly said “My brother is a good man and I can see he loves you very much, but he’s always been immature in his relationships and his idea of compromising is him saying he’s willing to compromise.” She then told me that she would support me no matter what I do.

Does anyone know what I can do?

Has anyone ever felt like an accessory in their relationship?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend continues to live his life as a bachelor despite me living with him and us building a life together. He makes big decisions by himself without talking to me about them, and I feel like I have to run his life when he’s gone. His total freedom in his life makes me feel chained to maintaining our relationship instead of us being equal life partners. Is it over?","Yes. I was an accessory in an ex’s life. He wasn’t willing to carve out a life for us, I was there peripherally, entirely on his terms. He “didn’t get” why I was unhappy either.  It’s because he and your boyfriend ARE living the lives they want. It’s almost as if they feel THEIR happiness should be enough for you. Spoiler alert, it isn’t. I went and found someone who wanted to build a life WITH me instead of adding me to his. I recommend you do so as well."
"what to do when you dislike your sibling's partner... I really don't like my brother's girlfriend and neither do a lot of my other family members. There's not much I can really do about it as he's made his choice and I have to respect that but what can I do for myself and other members of my family that don't get along with her either. It's all becoming very petty and juvenile (FB unfriending, yikes!) and all that seems to happen is I get angry about the whole situation. Anyone out there experienced the same thing that can give me any advice? I don't want to stop seeing and communicating with my bro and I also don't want to see him manipulated and bullied by someone who I believed he was in a loving and caring relationship with.","Be a fucking adult. Ignore her as much as possible, and bear her attendance when needed. You will have colleagues you do not get along with, other parents at the PTA, the kids Little League coach, whatever.  You do not have to sleep with her, you do not have to spend time with her without your brother, you do not have to like her, just be polite when you're in the same room.

Keep your own counsel, and try to make choices you can stand by  later. So stay away from petty and juvenile. if you really think she is some sort of horror show level of bad for your brother, have a calm conversation with him. Until that point, he is allowed to learn from his own mistakes, let him."
"There is a girl who is competing with me for a Head Student position, but she has been spreading rumors that I am a bully and insinuating to lower grades that I am a bad person in order to get ahead in the competition. What can I do to her to get her to shut up?","Why unethical? Confront her publicly and demand that she proves her (I'm assuming) lies. If she can't, then she's a liar and a gossip and as such not worthy of this position."
"SO struggling with school, what to say My SO is in school and I am not, I work full time and we text throughout the day but this week is their exams week &amp; I can't think of anything to say when they come to me with ""I FAILED THAT TEST"" ""I SUCK"" ""I HATE EVERYTHING"" every couple of hours or so. What should I say? Is there anything I *should* say?","Been there done that for the past 5 years with 2 young kids. 

I dealt with stuff like that by basically doing the same course myself, "" I failed that test""  ""OK,we'll grab something to eat, talk about how you did and work out were *WE* went wrong, *support* is the main thing. "" I suck"" "" you don't and never will"", let's grab a coffee and we'll look over the stuff you don't understand.

My wife was really bad at maths, is spend hours going through stuff with her, in the end she got her degree and now works full time. If your serious about her then the offering her the time, support, and patience you have is all you can do, you'll have a a million things you could be doing for yourself, but long term what others the bigger return?

Was the effort worth it? Taking an interest in her course stopped us drifting apart, seeing her Graduate was one of the proudest moments of my life, not just for her but for us."
"TL;DR I lied to make my potentially dubious-looking friendships look less bad to my bf, wanting to avoid questioning. I knew that this was a dealbreaker for him. What can I do to fix this cycle?

We have had trust problems from 2 months ago when I avoided a question about my casual dating history. He questioned me until I told him that there were 2 guys I had hooked up with a year ago whom I still kept a distant platonic friendship with. He didn't trust me when I told him nothing had happened since and that the guys knew I was in a relationship, because I had tried to avoid telling him about them entirely. To fix this we decided I should tell the guys that I was in a relationship with my bf specifically. When he asked me to tell him what I had texted them, I lied that I had told them the full story when actually I had only started the conversation. I felt awkward dropping names with guys who didn't really care to know much about my relationships, and had intended to tell them about my bf in a longer chain of texts. Because of this further deception, we decided that to fix it I should cut the 2 guys out of my life, and I did.

I just came back from a trip with my long-time close friend (28M). I told bf about this friend and how we had met when he tutored me when I was 12, and we had become friends for over 8 years now after ending the tutoring. My bf was suspicious of this friend being a creep and having groomer tendencies due to the age gap. In the midst of defending my friend, my bf asked how many rooms the Airbnb we stayed at on the trip had. I lied and said 2 when there had only been 1. In fact my friend and I are both in relationships and intended to sleep separately, and the place was advertised for 4 people, but the landlord made a mix-up with the sofabed that meant there was only 1 bed that we agreed to share. Absolutely nothing happened and boundaries were drawn, but in the moment I was afraid that my bf would have more reason to doubt my friendship, so I lied about the room situation. In hindsight it seems almost improbable that this chain of events leading to there being only 1 bed was coincidental, and I have no way of verifying this myself except for asking my friend for evidence.

My bf doesn't trust me and thinks I am a shitty person. I know trust is non-negotiable. In both situations I lied because I was afraid of the backlash from my bf of how my friendships looked, and believed I shouldn't receive suspicion about them because I have never crossed boundaries. But I have no excuse for crossing a line that is always worse than whatever I have to gain from avoiding the discomfort of a conversation. Can this be fixed? Even if it shouldn't, how I should think about it to stop this cycle of deception in the future?","**If telling the truth would end your new/recent relationship then your relationship is meant to come to an end.** 

That's it. Stop lying to the guy and drop him. Lying is bad, and it makes you the bad guy in the relationship.

I would be uncomfortable giving my dating history if I felt they would take that information and become angry about it. If you are friends with people you date, then you probably need an easier going dude that isn't upset by that. If someone asks you for information you don't want to give you say no. If that's the end, that's the best outcome for you."
"How to keep going, stay positive and level-headed, and find answers when you feel defeated and out of options.","I found a pattern, you keep telling yourself something and you actually begin to think it is true, it internalizes and keeps you in pain all the time. People with low confidence have kept on telling themselves they are not good enough and that has internalized, now a human doesn't want to be not good enough and therefore he lives a life in conflict.

What you do is keep telling the good things you see around yourself or about you. Things that are going in the direction of your wants, keep repeating it to yourself till it internalizes.

The second part is about being rational. Is what you see the reality? Are you really out of options?"
"“Are you his mom or his girlfriend?”
Girl. So my boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) walking downtown after dinner and are randomly stopped by a man who asks my boyfriend, “is that your mom or your girlfriend?” We were both like, what? No response, just walked away. But it’s HAUNTING ME. Bf says i dont look old. I dont think so either. Was he trolling us or is this some joke I know nothing about?? I can’t get it out of my head. Does anyone know what he might have implied or if he was just being rude?","If you were wearing retro fashion, he may have been confused. Meth, however, is a hell of a drug and his perception may have been impaired. I would not let it bother me."
"Ok so my sister (f23) is dating her boyfriend (m24) for about 3 years now.   He's a good guy and I'm happy for them. She's a bit insecure about her  looks. I don't know why as she's drop dead stunning but she just doesn't see it. He's loyal and loves her to death. Her boyfriend and I   get  along well. We don't hang out or text on a daily basis but we talk  sometimes and he's been texting me more often because of her christmas    present.

We do those huge get togethers at christman where all of our family, partners and family  friends (so also my bestie/roommate) are invited to my parents house and we just eat, drink and play games all night long. We have a group chat for planning purposes. My sister and her boyfriend are also in there. As  well as other family members, friends of my parents, neighboors and relatives. We all live close by.

I recently moved in with my best friend and got a new bed a few days  ago. I couldn't get it upstairs on my own (big boxes and far too heavy)  so I texted in the group if anyone is close by to halp me. My sisters  boyfriend (Fake Name Jake) said he's in my area and will come over. He  did and he helped me to set it up. It took maybe an hour in total and I  offered that he can have dinner with me as a thank you. I made a pizza, we ate and talked about the upcoming christmas.

Nothing happened. We just talked as friends. He left and an hour later my  sister called me to accuse me of being into her boyfriend. She told me that I have enough guy friends and guys that are into me that could have  helped but I had to choose HER BOYFRIEND.

I  have told her several times that I am not interested in Jake and that  there's nothing to worry about. She didn't believe me and just cussed me  out. She said things like I'm a (woman that liks to have sex with many men) and I'm not allowed to come to  the get together. I talked to my parents. They are on ""my side"" and say that she's overreacting.

Now my  sister says she and Jake aren't coming if I come. I tried to talk to  her. Jake  did as well. She's still super pissed and blocked me on all social media. I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have   invited him  to stay but he did me a favour so I wanted to show my   appretiation for  his wor, time and effort to help me. I would have done the same to everyone else that would have helped me.

We had dinner. I didn't invite him to have sex with me or anything. She's  also mad at Jake but not as much. He just texted me that she thinks I'm into him and tried to steal him from her. I'd never do that ever. She's my little sister and I'd never hurt her.

I'm at a loss atm because I want to resolve this issue before christmas. I  don't want us to make a fool out of ourself for fighting over something   stupid.

TL;DR: My sisters boyfriend helped me to set up my new bed. She thinks I asked him to help me because I'm into him and she wont let go of the idea I'm stealing him from her.

Sorry if the format is a bit off - I tried my best","there is another possibility and that could be that something he has done (without you knowing about it) caused her to think that he might be into you some how. what you can tell her is that you are trying to have a ""brother in law"" type relationship with him and nothing more. that in your eyes the two of them are together for the long haul and you accept him as family accordingly. 

her reaction is an overreaction but there is some underlying cause to it, something that caused the insecurity either from now or her past."
"Me (F22) and my boyfriend (M25) have been together for almost 2 years. Before we started dating, he already had a good female friend that i am totally okay with and met a few times, since they already knew each other for a long time and see each other only from time to time.

1 or 2 months ago he found a new female friend who is a student at the college we both attend. I am not against the idea of him finding new female friends in general, but i do feel suspicious of their friendship because they see each other quite regularly (about once a week, they live 1 minute apart). I currently only see him once a week as well. And they exclusively meet in the evenings or at nighttime by themselves in either of their apartments while drinking alcohol and watching a movie on a couch or bed.

I told him that i am uncomfortable with him doing that and that i'd feel much safer if they met during daytime or at another place that isn't either of their apartments. However he refuses to compromise and accused me of having trust issues. He claims that they can only meet up in private places because she has ""serious issues"" that he wants to listen to and help with, and they're apparently serious enough that i am not allowed to know about them. Keep in mind that they haven't known each other for a long time and that he doesn't do that with either of his other friends, male or female.

So reddit, what are your thoughts on this? Am i crazy or is this concerning?

tl;dr: boyfriend has new female friend and i'm concerned because i feel like their friendship is getting too intimate too fast. Boyfriend isn't willing to compromise or accept my boundaries. Am i being crazy or reasonable?","If they only hang out in private because of her issues, what’s the problem with meeting at daytime?"
"How to deal with tactless people who have no idea they're being rude. ""Oh you guys look awful!"", ""Aw! What happened to your face?"" Yes yes I get it. We look awful. We look shit. You do too, but I just don't do it it on your face.","The same way you would respond to anyone else? 

""Oh aren't *you* a charmer?"" etc etc...if they don't understand they're being tactless then they'll learn it by you saying something about it."
how do I find friends? As in the title. I dont really have friends. Currently I go to university. And because of bullying during my regular school time I never had the chance to learn how you find friends,"Volunteer for a cause you're interested in, or join a student society related to an interest of yours.  There's then a structure there that gets you out and around other people, it gives you easy and obvious ice-breakers, it means you'll be seeing (and getting to know) the same people week after week, and you know that the other people around you have similair interests to you.

Volunteering is an especially good one, because it's something that can extend beyond university."
"My mom has been crying and is devastated since I moved out what do I do?
I grew up with a single mom and for a while was my only guardian before my dad came back to be part of my life. Where very close and to her it’s just me in her family. I decided I wanted to move out for college with a friend and get an apartment in the city but since then my mom has been torn and never even wanted me to move out in the first place. She’s lived alone since and said how much she miss me and wants me to move back in but today she called and was crying on the phone how lonely she is and how afraid she is and wants me to consider moving back in when my lease is up though I’ve been planning for me and my gf to then move in which again she’s not fond of. I visit her each week between school and work but she’s still sad. What do I do, I don’t like my mom being so lonely and sad but then again I’m almost 20 and should live my own life?","Your mom needs therapy. I can understand being lonely but the whole point of being a parent is getting your child to the point where they can be independent. Everyone has to deal with being alone at some point. Even if you lived with just her your whole life, one day she will die and then the roles are reversed. You visit her every week. I don’t even hang out with certain friends that often. You shouldn’t change anything you’re doing because of her. She’s the one who’s going to have to learn to cope with her empty nest syndrome. If I were you I’d gently recommend counseling, but don’t try to compromise any more than you have been. You’ll just be stunting your own growth."
I have a week free before a stressful couple of months. What can I do to completely refresh myself in this week?,"Establish a daily routine that you can keep doing during your stressful time.  Drink water as soon as you wake up. Go on a walk or yoga or whatever excercise you enjoy. Do small things, everyday, at the time you'll need to do them when you are on the stressful schedule.  Build the habit and it will serve you."
"How to be satisfied with what you have? I bet many of you guys face this problem, but sometimes my head just won't stop wondering ""What if x or y I have is not the best for me? What could be out there that is better?""

Lately it's been happening specifically with women. I met a great girl, been dating her for 4 months. Our intellectual connection is great, and she's really cute, but I can't help wonder how it would feel to date some other girls that I meet that I really like.

Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't happen only with girls, same with cellphones, computers, etc.

Any tips appreciated :D","Grass is always greener. Everybody has these thoughts and it's normal. Only thing that helps me is to think about why I love the things I love. Thing about the things in the past that were negative and what brought me to be in possession of object x, or dating/married to person y.

With most things in life we really don't know. You might be able to dump your GF tonight and meet the true girl of your dreams tomorrow. Or maybe you'll spend the next 40 years in misery because she really was the best. Same line of thought can be applied in some way to just about everything.

"How to converse with intrusive people? We all know those people, the ones who have a litany of questions every time you talk to them. They want to know as much information about you as your spouse would and maybe more. And then they give you advice on all aspects of life, because they know everything. 

Usually I can handle these types of interactions with strangers very well. I don't value their opinion too much, so I freely speak my mind. However I have a few family members and coworkers that are like this and I'm not quite sure how to say ""back the f**k off"" without coming across as a total  B. Especially because the questions aren't necessarily outlandish, it's just the amount of them and constant inquiry. 

Any tips on how to handle these convos in a low-key realistic way? 

If it makes a difference, I'm a 29F who looks closer to 20. Any assertion comes seems to come across as emotional or bitchy. Soooooo HALP! 

Thanks in advance!","I use diversion as a tactic. When someone starts in with questioning I find too intrusive I'll sway the conversation elsewhere. 

> Example: ""Hey! When are you guys going to get married? It's been a long time, hasn't it?""

> ""Oh, you know, those things happen when it's right. Hell, it's all we can do just to get through this whole water heater debacle.""

> ""Huh? What's going on with the water heater.""

> ""Well...."" (and now we're talking about water heaters)

Of course you have to have a story prepared before you get to the event"
"So my gf and I have dated for almost a year now. It's a good relationship and I have never caught her in a lie. And to be clear, I don't care about the past and how many bodies a girl has, as long as she is honest from the jump.

Very early when we started dating, she told me her body count pretty early on (it was 3) and was very transparent about her past dating / sexual experiences really without me even asking or prodding. Mentioned that she hadn't dated for a whole year and a half before seeing me. Collectively, I found her confiding strange, because it's pretty sensitive information, and I found it weird that she felt so comfortable telling me her count without me even asking. She didn't even proceed to ask what mine was. I also just find it crazy because she is so extroverted and quite attractive...but only has a body count of 3 before me?

Anyhow, there's some things that make me feel like things aren't adding up. First, she was very willing to get sexual early on when we started dating. She said she just really liked me and felt comfortable with me..but after not dating for a year and a half, I think it's crazy that she felt comfortable enough to invite me to her room on the second date. We had sex within a month I think.

She mentioned really liking a guy before me that she dated for a month, but he ghosted her. And she said they only ever kissed. She liked this guy so much, but they only kissed - while she invited me to her room on the second date? It just doesn't seem to add up.

I don't want to assume she is lying, but is this peculiar? Or am I being paranoid? Everyone says that a girls lie about their body count, especially when it is below 5. Not sure what to think

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Gf was very transparent and open about her body count early on when we dated without me even asking. This and some other details seem peculiar and part of me thinks she could be lying. Not sure what to think overall. Am I being paranoid?","Men who think like you do are the reason women don't feel safe telling the truth about their sexual history.

Number's too low for your comfort? She's a liar.

Number's too high for your comfort? She's a sl\*t.

Make up your goddamned mind. You either trust her or you don't."
"TL:DR: we have been seeing each other for 10 months, he says he needs more time to commit. He's not ready for a relationship right now.

Hey everyone. I (31F) have been seeing this guy (28F) since January.
We live less than 2 hours away, so we meet on weekends.
Around 3 months ago I asked the big question to this guy ""what are we?"". He said that I'm very special to him, that he cares a lot about me and pointed out what a valuable woman he thinks I am. But told me he's not ready for a relationship yet, saying he needs some time. That he wants to build a relationship with me in the future, but he just can't now. 
He also said this has nothing to do with me. Told me he feels vulnerable when he thinks about a relationship and also because he feels he needs to work on himself first.
 He just had a serious relationship on his early 20's. It lasted 6 months and it was super toxic. 

We are exclusive and do everything what a couple does. Sex is great, we have deep intimate conversations. We talk all day long and trust on each other. We have a lot of fun.
But I just can't understand why wouldn't he want a relationship with me if he actually cares about me the way he says he does.

I'm confused. I'm really into him, he's a part of my life now and I would really like it to work out. I can see and feel he loves me, but at the same time it hurts me a lot the fact that we are not in the same page, meaning he doesn't wants me the way I want him.

It creates me a lot of insecurities too. Is he willing to be with other women?

I don't know what to think. As I said, I can see how much he cares about me, but I'm not sure if that's enough to keep waiting.

Sorry if my post is a little confusing, English is not my native language.",Well he's made the relationship decision; he doesn't want one.  So you can continue on this plateau or you can tell him that you do want one so if he doesn't then you don't see a future with him and call it quits. Otherwise you're probably going be posting this exact same scenario a year from now with no progress.
