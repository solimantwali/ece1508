You can't wait until happiness falls on your lap, because you'll end up waiting forever.\n\nIf you lack drive and such, then find a goal, plan how to achieve that goal, and execute the plan.  Keep doing this, and soon you'll realize these small wins and achievements make you a better person, AND make you happier with yourself.\n\nAnd NO, video game achievements and trophies don't count.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad to hear you're aware of your feelings and willing to work on them! Feeling unhappy with oneself can be a tough spot to be in. Let's dive into this together.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's normal to go through periods where you feel unmotivated or disconnected from your goals. It's not uncommon, especially with the pressures of modern life.\n\nTo get back on track, I'd like to suggest a few things:\n\n1. **Reconnect with your values**: Take some time to reflect on what matters most to you. What are your non-negotiables? What brings you a sense of purpose and fulfillment? When you're aligned with your values, you'll feel more driven and motivated.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, just as you would to a close friend. Acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect, and that you're doing the best you can. Treat yourself with kindness, and try to reframe negative self-talk into constructive, supportive thoughts.\n3. **Identify your why**: When you're feeling unmotivated, it's often because you're not connected to the reasons behind your goals. What's driving you? What's the purpose behind what you're trying to achieve? When you're reminded of your \"why,\" you'll be more likely to take action.\n4. **Take small steps**: Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate your tiny wins, and build momentum. This will help you regain your sense of accomplishment and motivation.\n5. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This might include exercise, meditation, reading, or spending time in nature. When you're taking care of yourself, you'll feel more energized and focused.\n6. **Seek accountability**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend or mentor. Having someone to hold you accountable and offer support can make a big difference. You might also consider joining a community or finding an accountability partner online.\n7. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness can help you reframe your perspective and cultivate a greater sense of appreciation for what you have.\n\nRemember, my friend, it's a process to get back on track. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Celebrate small wins, and keep moving forward.\n\nWhat resonates with you the most from this list? Is there anything specific you'd like to work on first?"

While it's not a deal-breaker for everyone, it's a significant consideration.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't rule out dating someone who believes in God solely based on their religious beliefs. If the connection is strong, and we're compatible in many other aspects, I'd be willing to explore the relationship further.\n\nHowever, I would want to have open and honest conversations about our differences and how we envision our future together. This includes discussing our values, beliefs, and expectations regarding parenting.\n\nRegarding coparenting, I'd want to establish clear boundaries and compromises. Here are some potential considerations:\n\n1. **Respect each other's beliefs**: We'd need to respect each other's beliefs and values, even if we don't share them. This means being open to listening to each other's perspectives and being understanding when we disagree.\n2. **Parenting philosophy**: We'd need to discuss our parenting philosophy and values. If you're adamant about not raising your kids religious, I'd want to know how you plan to address spiritual or moral guidance. Similarly, if I were to share my own beliefs, I'd want to understand your approach to spirituality.\n3. **Religious practices**: We'd need to discuss how we'd approach religious practices, such as prayer, worship, or attending church. I'd want to know if your partner would expect our kids to participate or attend religious services, and how you'd handle any potential conflicts.\n4. **Education**: We'd need to discuss how we'd educate our kids about religion. Would you want them to learn about different faiths, or would you prefer a more secular approach?\n5. **Compromise**: We'd need to find common ground and compromise on these issues. For example, we might agree to expose our kids to different religions and values, but also prioritize a secular education.\n\nRemember, every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. If you feel like the connection is strong and you're willing to work through these differences, it might be worth exploring further.\n\nIn your case, since you've only had one date, it's understandable to be cautious. You could try to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and boundaries. If they're willing to listen and respect your views, it might be worth continuing the relationship.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to prioritize your own values and what you're comfortable with. Take your time, and don't rush into anything that makes you feel uncertain or uncomfortable."

    "sentence": "How to stop being an emotional abuser My marriage is on the verge of ending, and I know it's my fault. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. \n\nAnyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck. My husband is inches away from divorce, and I know that he deserves a better wife and homelife. How do I stop? Especially since I didn't know I was doing it. \n\nPlease help!",
    "human": "First step is responsibility. Remember that it doesn't matter that you didn't know you were doing it,  or how bad it makes you feel to be an abuser. Don't burden him by asking him to forgive you,  he has been through enough. \n\nHe probably feels disrespected, unimportant, and unloved. Approach this by seeking a therapist (not a marriage therapist- one just for you, to overcome your problem) so he can see that you acknowledge his feelings, and also for your sake as a person. \n\nI would also advise to move to another room in the house to further reiterate you're serious about changing. Your mere presence probably makes him uneasy,  and this way he can have room to feel more like himself. It shows respect and consideration,  which is a form of love.\n\nThroughout the process, remember he doesn't owe you anything. Not forgiveness, or even kindness. He's pissed off as hell- let him be. Be patient, be kind, listen well. Whenever you feel like you're about to take a step back in progress,  excuse yourself from the room to deal with your feelings. \n\nGood luck saving your marriage.\n\nSource: Domestic Violence survivor of a male - female relationship.

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Recognizing the harm you've caused is a huge step, and it takes a lot of courage to admit it. Emotional abuse is a serious issue, and it's not just about being \"mean\" or \"bad\" - it's a pattern of behavior that can have long-term, devastating effects on your partner and children.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that you're not alone, and you're not a bad person. You're someone who's struggling with deep-seated issues, and you're willing to work on changing. That's the first step towards healing and growth.\n\nTo stop being an emotional abuser, you'll need to make a conscious effort to change your behavior and develop healthier communication habits. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Seek professional help**: Therapy is crucial in addressing your depression, anger issues, and emotional abuse patterns. A therapist can help you identify triggers, develop coping mechanisms, and work on building empathy and communication skills.\n2. **Take responsibility**: Acknowledge the harm you've caused and take ownership of your actions. Apologize sincerely to your husband and children, and make amends when possible.\n3. **Learn healthy communication**: Practice active listening, use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, and avoid blaming or attacking language. Learn to express your feelings and needs without being aggressive or manipulative.\n4. **Develop empathy**: Put yourself in your husband's shoes and try to understand how your actions affected him. Practice empathy and validation, and work on building a deeper understanding of his feelings and needs.\n5. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries to protect yourself and others from further harm. Learn to recognize and manage your emotions, and develop healthier ways to express them.\n6. **Rebuild trust**: Rebuilding trust takes time and effort. Be patient, consistent, and transparent in your actions and words. Show your husband that you're committed to change and willing to work towards a healthier relationship.\n7. **Seek support**: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who can help you stay accountable and motivated. Consider joining a support group or online community for people dealing with emotional abuse.\n8. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that you're not a bad person, and you didn't intend to hurt anyone. Forgive yourself for your mistakes, and focus on moving forward.\n\nRemember, changing is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. It's not easy, but it's possible. You can learn to break free from emotional abuse and build a healthier, more loving relationship with your husband and children.\n\nKeep in mind that your husband's decision to leave the marriage is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's a reflection of his own boundaries and needs, which you need to respect. If he chooses to stay, that's a blessing, but if he chooses to leave, it's not the end of the world. You can still work on yourself, grow, and find happiness and fulfillment.\n\nRemember, you are capable of change, and you deserve a life free from emotional abuse."

Here's what I'd suggest:\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that it's not uncommon for people to feel uncertain or indecisive at times. It might not be a reflection of your relationship or your partner's feelings towards you.\n\nSince you're the one initiating the conversation, try reframing the situation by asking open-ended questions instead of presenting a list of options. For example:\n\n* \"Hey, what's been on your mind lately? Is there something you've been wanting to do or try?\"\n* \"What do you think would be a great way to spend our free time today?\"\n* \"Is there anything that's been holding you back from doing something you enjoy?\"\n\nBy asking these types of questions, you're giving your partner the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings without feeling pressured or overwhelmed by a long list of options.\n\nIf your partner still struggles to come up with an idea, you could try suggesting a compromise. For instance:\n\n* \"Why don't we take some time to browse through a hobby website, a book, or a social media platform to get some inspiration? Maybe something will catch our eye.\"\n* \"Let's take a few minutes to daydream together. What are some things we've always wanted to try but haven't had the chance to yet?\"\n\nRemember, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on your partner or making them feel guilty for not having an answer. Instead, focus on finding a solution that works for both of you and prioritizes your relationship.\n\nLastly, consider having an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling. Let them know that you're looking for ways to spend quality time together and that you're willing to work together to find something that you both enjoy."

He's hoping to become a teacher and is currently working as a substitute. We've been dating for almost three years after meeting in college, but when I stumbled upon something that I bought to his attention, he made me out to be the enemy while accusing me of \"not being on his side\"\n\nEric is involved in a few role-play groups on Twitter, and he has a few accounts that portray various fictional characters. He's also into D&amp;D, but writing stories for his RP group to act out is his hobby, and while I'm not a part of the group, I followed some of the accounts to keep up with his storylines, and he sometimes asks me for opinions on his stories. However, I stumbled upon an account that I wasn't supposed to find, but did because some of his RP accounts followed it (as many of his accounts follow each other), and it was an account that impersonated one of his friends. Long story short... there's a guy named Evan who is in his D&amp;D group, and Evan is one of his closest friends. Evan also has a younger brother (Todd) who sometimes tags along to D&amp;D, and he is a talented artist who has drawn many of Eric's characters and profile photos for his RP accounts too. And while I'm not an active member of D&amp;D, I've met him a few times when I've tagged along on days when Eric would invite me\n\nEvan and Todd come from a military family where both of their parents served, but Evan went to college. Todd wanted to go into the service upon finishing high school, but Eric would try to convince him to go to college because he believed it was better than the service. However, Todd still wanted to enter. So, Eric spoke to Evan to try and get him on his side, but Evan reinforced that the choice was ultimately Todd's and that there are benefits to both the military and college. So, neither would be a bad choice, and I agreed with that too. However, when an injury would prevent Todd from being able to enter, Eric believed that he would opt for college, but he landed an internship through a connection with his father that would allow him to learn a trade instead, and that is what led to what happened recently\n\nEric made a Twitter that impersonated Todd, but unlike his RP accounts, he actually made it look like Todd's actual account and began using it to make fun of him. He downloaded photos of Todd and used them to make memes that degraded him for not going to college, some calling him \"stupid\" and \"how he got what he deserved\" by suffering the injury and not being able to enter, but he didn't stop there. He also downloaded photos from the accounts of family/relatives and began making fun of them for the internship he landed, posting photos of people who weren't Todd too. When I told him what I found and asked why he felt he could do this, he said that \"everyone sucks up to military families\" and that they're \"probably poor enough to get free college\" which is \"better than an internship\". When I pointed out a meme where he called Todd \"mentally re\\_\\_\\_\\_ted\", he said it was \"true\" because they were \"stupid to refuse college\" and \"think they're better than it\". When I told him that he has no right to berate Todd and a bunch of people related to him, he refused to take it down and said it's \"better than exploding in Todd's face\" when it really bothers him as someone who has a master's in teaching and wants everyone to know how important school is. But, when I told him that Todd is entitled to his own opinion, he accused me of \"taking Todd's side\" and \"not being sensitive of his ADHD\" and how he uses Twitter to vent when he's \"unable to focus\" which allows him to \"be more even keel in public\". When I asked if he had done this to anyone else besides Todd, he told me to \"mind my own business\" and refused to take it down. He also said that he had \"done this for a while\" and that only now I had an issue with it, and the account about Todd was a few weeks old\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter we talked that night, I planned to tell him that I wanted a break, but I didn't want to say it without preparing for him to potentially do the same to me on Twitter. So, after taking the advice of a lot of people, I decided to tell my family and relatives about how he had gone on a rampage of downloading photos of Todd's family/relatives and advised them to make their accounts private or block him, and a lot of them were really thankful that I told them. The main reason I did was because Eric downloaded photos of minors who were related to Todd, and I didn't want him doing the same to my family and making memes out of uninvolved people. I also spoke to Evan and told/showed him what had happened, and he was really upset and said that he and his parents were going to call the school Eric's interning/subbing at and let them know of what he's been doing not only to Todd, but also to minors in their family who he downloaded images of. He also said that he and his parents went to the police to address it, but as of writing, the account of Todd that Eric made is still somehow up and not yet deleted, and maybe it's because Eric made the account private after our initial conversation, but I don't know. I gave them all of my screenshots, but as of now, nothing has happened. Evan's parents also told/showed the school what happened, but he is still employed and subbing at the moment, and Evan said that they were having a hard time proving the account was Eric's although they are still trying to get it taken down. He also has relatives who are complaining to the school too about photos Eric downloaded of them and their children, but almost a month later, nothing has happened yet\n\nAfter talking to Evan and my family, I told Eric that we were done, but he began making posts about me on one of his RP accounts and how I was apparently \"cheating on him\" and \"trying to start rumors\", and I screenshotted what he posted, but still nothing has happened. He also started posting about some prescriptions I've taken that I never told anyone besides family, but my relatives have been supportive throughout. But, I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt. He's also started posting memes about me too, and I have record of all of it, and I'm hoping that with time and all of the people/relatives reporting that something can happen soon, but I'm slightly surprised nothing has happened yet. Lastly, I want to say that this whole thing has shown a side of him that I've never really seen before. Like, we've argued. But, stumbling across this account and what he \"uses to vent and cope with ADHD\" just made him so aggressive because he said that it was \"as if I was removing an inhaler from someone who needs it\" when we talked that night and he got so defensive. That's what he compared it too, me \"making fun of people with special needs\" as he's also posted about, and that's where I am now. I feel like I've done almost as much as I can, and waiting is hard. So, if anyone has any advice on how to push through this time with an ex who's trying to destroy everyone I know, I would really appreciate it. But, it's hard right now, and I'll end with this. He's also gone about posting images of me too, but nothing explicit as we've never taken those. However, he's started posting photos of me when I was in high school and in dance and making degrading comments about my body, and I've taken screenshots of those to the police too as I'm still waiting to see what happens. I've been told that it can be a process, but that has hurt the most and is what I'm trying to push through, and if anyone has any advice on how to just get past a toxic ex who goes to such measures, I would really appreciate it because right now is really hard. I'm hoping something happens soon, but maybe it's just a process, but I could just use all of the advice I could get\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: After our initial conversation where I confronted him on what I found, I wanted to break up, but not immediately until I got some things in order after many of the helpful comments from the first post, and I decided to warn family/relatives to block him or make their accounts private, but he's started posting about me in the same way he did to Todd",
    "human": "What a horrible person he is! You have an amazing amount of strength to be able to stand up to that nonsense!

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt and frustrated. It sounds like Eric has shown a toxic side of himself, and it's not acceptable for him to target you, your family, and his friend Todd like that.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that you've taken a lot of steps to address the situation, from warning your family and relatives to report him to the authorities. It's impressive that you've been proactive and taken screenshots of his posts. You've also spoken to Evan and his parents, which is great.\n\nIn terms of moving forward, I want to emphasize that it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and take time to process your emotions. It's not easy to deal with someone who's trying to harm you and your loved ones. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Focus on self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Whether it's exercise, reading, or spending time with loved ones, prioritize your own well-being.\n2. **Set boundaries**: It's essential to limit your exposure to Eric's online behavior. Consider blocking him on social media, and avoid engaging with his posts. This will help reduce your stress levels and prevent further hurt.\n3. **Reach out for support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what you're going through. Sharing your experiences with someone you trust can help you process your emotions and gain a different perspective.\n4. **Document everything**: Continue to keep records of all the online interactions, including screenshots and dates. This will be helpful if you need to take legal action or provide evidence to the authorities.\n5. **Don't engage**: Avoid responding to Eric's posts or engaging with him in any way. This will only give him attention and fuel his behavior.\n6. **Take time to heal**: It's essential to give yourself time to heal and reflect on the relationship. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or hurt, and it's crucial to acknowledge those emotions.\n7. **Seek legal advice**: If you haven't already, consider consulting with a lawyer or law enforcement to discuss the situation and potential legal action.\n\nRemember, you don't deserve to be treated this way, and it's not your fault. You've done everything you can to address the situation, and it's time to focus on your own healing and well-being."

    "sentence": "I've (25F) been dating my partner (26M) for around 9 months. He has been my first romantic relationship.\n\nWe've  been having conversations around sex for a couple of weeks, he seemed  very keen and like he was looking forward to it. I've been initiating  the discussions, because I asked him to take it slow, and I grew up in a  not very physically affectionate household, and it's been a learning  experience to allow myself to enjoy romantic attention in that way. But  we talked about how we have a similar view of sex, not interested in  casual sex and wanting emotional connection as a key part of it, which  we both felt like we had and were ready for sex.\n\nSo  yesterday we were hanging out and he told me that he was very attracted  to me in that moment and had an erection, and so I asked him if he  wanted to go to the bedroom, and he said yes, but didn't move. So I  checked in, and told him we didn't have to have sex if he didn't want  to, but he said he did. Before we had sex, I opened up and told him it  was my first time, and that I wanted him to take it slow and him take  the lead a bit. We started having sex, and he was silent with no  checking of consent, quite rough, and not as caring or affectionate as I  would have hoped, even when I tried to tell him what I liked, he didn't  listen, and it just felt really mechanical.\n\nAs  soon as he was done, his head hit the pillow and he said \"Oh, here's  something I haven't mentioned yet, I'm asexual I think, but I really  don't know for sure\". This shocked me because he specifically told me he  wasn't, he just preferred sex in relationships and with partners. I  asked him about it a little more, and he said \"I could go our whole  relationship without having sex, I don't really like it or care about it, and my maximum amount of sex would be once every week or even every  fortnight, because I know you want it\".\n\nI said to him that my minimum was at least once a week, and I thought  that this was a pretty significant issue that we'd need to talk about  more, because I don't want to feel like I'm forcing him to have sex for  my sake. He then asked me how I felt if \"we never had sex at all?\", and  \"how would you have felt if we didn't have sex tonight?\". I said I was  looking forward to it, but of course he could say no at any time, and he  seemed to understand, but said he didn't really know what he wanted.\n\nBut  I went home and started thinking about the conversation, feeling like he wasn't 100% truthful in giving consent that he wanted sex, especially now knowing he is asexual, and him trying to gauge if he would have  ruined things by saying no. So I called him today, basically saying that  I was upset that he withheld his asexuality identity before sex, when I  had opened up a vulnerable dialogue right before telling him that I was  a virgin, and that he didn't give me the opportunity to make up my mind  to have sex with someone that didn't really care whether it happened or  not.\n\nI asked him point blank did  he really want to have sex with me, and he said \"yes\", and I called him  out on the mixed messages, and asked him again to be 100% truthful,  when he finally said, \"No, I didn't want to have sex with you\". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that my first experience wasn't consensual and he didn't want to be there, and I don't know how to process or handle this.\n\nI  basically told him I needed space to think and process this experience,  and that he needed to go and think about what he actually wants,  whether he sees any sex life with me at all, and how he can communicate  clearly about when he wants it or when he doesn't. But I feel like  there's been a huge violation of trust, and I don't know if I can trust him to give me genuine consent, or if he's giving me consent to keep the  peace.\n\nI guess I'm wondering  whether this relationship is salvageable, and how other people manage  being in a relationship with an asexual partner and a partner with a high libido?\n\nTL;DR - My boyfriend admitted that he was asexual after taking my virginity, told me he doesn't like sex, and didn't even want to have sex with me and he lied and told me that he did.\n\nThank you for your advice, I'm really hurt and confused and struggling to think straight!",
    "human": "The issue is much more strongly a lack of honest communication from one side of the relationship. How can you trust in the future what he's telling you about sex if he wasn't honest this time? So even if you're able to make an arrangement based on your needs and his supposed asexuality, can you believe and trust that it is a true, consensual, thought out communicated position. Your relationship has trust issues because he did not treat communication properly.",

First and foremost, please know that you did nothing wrong. You had every right to expect honesty and consent from your partner, and you were right to feel upset when that wasn't given to you.\n\nIt's not okay for your partner to withhold his asexuality from you before having sex, especially when you were already vulnerable and open about your own desires. It's also not okay for him to lie about his willingness to have sex with you when he didn't actually want to.\n\nAs for whether the relationship is salvageable, it's a difficult decision. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel heard, respected, and valued. If your partner is unwilling to be honest with you about his desires and needs, it may be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nBeing in a relationship with an asexual partner can be challenging, but it's not impossible. However, it's crucial that both partners communicate openly and honestly about their desires and boundaries. It's not just about sex; it's about emotional intimacy, affection, and connection.\n\nIf you decide to stay in the relationship, you'll need to have a serious conversation with your partner about his asexuality and how it affects your relationship. You'll need to discuss what sex means to you and what you're willing to compromise on. You may also need to explore other ways to maintain emotional intimacy and connection.\n\nOn the other hand, if you decide to leave the relationship, it's essential to prioritize your own healing and well-being. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected. Take time to focus on yourself, your needs, and your desires.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. There are many people who have navigated similar situations and have come out stronger on the other side. You are strong, capable, and deserving of love and respect.\n\nLastly, please take care of yourself and prioritize your physical and emotional well-being during this challenging time. You got through this difficult conversation, and you can get through this too."

I understand he’s angry and I should have been more considerate but there are many more factors that should have weighed into his feelings.\n1. We have been together almost 9 years. Of those 9 years, I have never had a pregnancy scary, have always either taken pills or had an IUD AND my BF still wears condoms most times we do have sex. \n\n2. I did not take my placebo pill during a week I was already on my period. We are not usually sexually active during my period.  And were not this time. \n\n3. DIRECTLY after the week of placebo pills of this pack, I got an IUD inserted. \n\n4. BF still uses a condom almost every time. \n\nNow he’s incredibly upset with me and telling me he could never trust me again. I’m not sure what to tell him. I understand he’s upset but given all these added factors, I don’t think this should be relationship ending. Am I wrong?\n\nETA for context: we actually already had this fight about a month ago and we agreed it was his right to know about my birth control decisions. HOWEVER. The placebo is the placebo. I know it does nothing whether I took it or not. What he’s upset about is my decision to not take it without telling him. What I don’t understand is why this is such a big deal given all the previous factors AND it being a placebo pill.",
    "human": "Do you both realize the placebo pill is literally *a placebo*? It doesn't have any medication, it's just there to keep you in the habit of taking a pill every day while you have your period. It doesn't change anything. It does nothing.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's understandable that your boyfriend is upset, but it's also important to consider the context you've provided.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're acknowledging his feelings and understanding his perspective. However, it's equally important to stand up for yourself and your actions. Since you've already had this conversation with him about being open about your birth control decisions, it's reasonable to expect that he would understand the context of the placebo pill.\n\nGiven the facts you've shared, it's clear that you've been responsible with your birth control and have a consistent track record of using protection. The fact that you got an IUD inserted shortly after the placebo pill period further reinforces your commitment to responsible behavior.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the placebo pill is, indeed, a placebo. It's not a reliable method of contraception, and it's not a significant risk factor in terms of pregnancy. It's understandable that your boyfriend is upset, but his reaction may be more about the perceived breach of trust rather than the actual risk.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Acknowledge his upset and let him know that you understand why he's angry. However, also express your perspective and highlight the context you've provided. Explain that you've been responsible with your birth control, that the placebo pill is a placebo, and that you've taken steps to ensure your safety and his.\n\nIt's also important to consider whether this is a deal-breaker for your boyfriend. If he's unable to move past this incident and understand the context, it may be a sign that he's not willing to work through issues and trust you as a partner. In that case, it may be worth reevaluating the relationship.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself during this challenging time."

    "sentence": "My (25F) previously abusive dad (59M) is in therapy and better, but I can’t get over the past and don’t want to forgive him.\n\nMy dad was abusive to me as a child and teenager, although I didn’t realize it then. He would oscillate between extremely sweet in an overbearing way, calling me pet names and using a sweet voice, lots of hugging etc. to blowing up at a moment’s notice. I never knew when it was going to happen or what would cause it. When I was a preteen / teen it might be a “tone” I had in my voice, he would scream and swear at me and call me a fucking brat until I cried. When I was a little kid (3 or 4) I once called 9-1-1 on a dare from my sister. It didn’t even ring, I hung up out of fear, he found out and came in and screamed at me at the top of his lungs and I cried the entire day. He would threaten to hit me sometimes but never did, although I did get spanked as a child. One time when I was 3 or so I cut a little piece of my sister’s hair off (she told me to) and he screamed and threatened to “shave my whole fucking head” etc. He was alcoholic for a while during the recession and picked us up from school events while drinking in the car. My sister threatened to tell and he yelled at us and told us not to “throw him under the bus”.\n\nThen when he was nice again he would touch my arm or something and I’d recoil, and he’d ask what was wrong with me, I was his daughter, he had a right and so on. He said he loved me and wanted to spend time with me but because I was afraid of him snapping I’d hide in my room and lock the door. He’d threaten to take the door off the hinges (he didn’t, but he would angrily shake it and bang on it if he saw it was locked). Lots of other stuff too, like him insulting and screaming at me for not believing everything he did (he thinks global warming is a hoax, voted for Trump, is racist and homophobic), he was drunk and high on my birthdays, but I could just keep going on.\n\nI went back for Christmas this year mostly out of guilt and for the first time ever he was strangely fine. No screaming, no insults, no excessive drinking, and he didn’t bring up politics. No guilt tripping when I didn’t want him touching me. He’s been in therapy and is working on himself. I’m happy he’s better, but I still am really suspicious and I can’t forgive everything he’s done. He’s never made those apologies himself or brought up how he treated us. He thinks he was the “best dad ever” and that’s why my sister and I got straight As and went to amazing schools (it was because we worked our asses off to get out of their house.) I succeeded with no thanks to my parents. They try to make me feel indebted because they “fed me and put a roof over my head” when there are “children in Africa dying.” I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive my dad (or my mom for enabling him - she’s not a good person either). I think he’s a narcissist and while I’m really shocked the therapy seems to be working, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him and I’m not sure if I want to. I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive him. I never really sat down and told him everything I feel and think, but I don’t want to. I feel like I shouldn’t have to - it’s very clear he was not good to me or my sister. I’m low contact but also considering going no contact because I feel it would relieve a burden for me. Should I want to try? Just looking for advice on how to navigate my feelings here.\n\nTLDR; my dad was abusive in the past and is in therapy and has been better for several months, but I don’t want to forgive him, and am considering going no contact.\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people are asking - I have been in therapy in the past and am looking for a new therapist now due to coverage changes. It helped me work through trauma to an extent, but I’m definitely still dealing with it. I just wanted to get this out here anyway. Thanks for your support everyone :)",

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about the abuse you experienced at the hands of your father. It's completely understandable that you're struggling to forgive him, and it's not necessary to forgive him if you don't feel ready or comfortable doing so.\n\nFirstly, please know that you don't owe anyone an explanation for your feelings or actions. You're not obligated to forgive someone who has caused you harm, and it's not a requirement for your own healing or well-being. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries.\n\nRegarding going no contact, it's a personal decision that only you can make. If you feel that it would be beneficial for your mental health and well-being to distance yourself from your father, then it might be worth considering. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of going no contact, such as potentially causing harm to others (e.g., your mother, siblings, or other family members) or creating tension within the family.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore the reasons behind your desire to go no contact. Are you doing it to avoid confronting your feelings or to protect yourself from potential triggers or emotional distress? Are there any specific incidents or behaviors that you're trying to avoid? Understanding your motivations can help you make a more informed decision.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to confront your father or have a direct conversation with him about your feelings. You can prioritize your own healing and well-being by setting boundaries and maintaining distance without feeling guilty or obligated to engage with him.\n\nIn terms of your guilt for not wanting to forgive your father, please remember that forgiveness is a process, and it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. You don't have to forgive someone who has caused you harm, and it's not necessary to forgive for your own healing. You can choose to focus on your own healing and growth, rather than feeling obligated to forgive someone who has caused you pain.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that you're not alone in this. There are many people who have experienced similar trauma and are navigating their own healing journeys. Consider seeking support from a therapist or support group to help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies for managing your emotions.\n\nRemember, your well-being is paramount, and it's okay to prioritize yourself in this situation."

    "sentence": "My [30sF] neighbor is a young man in his early 20s. He is autistic, quite high-functioning. Lives with his dad and I believe his grandma and siblings. Sweet guy, knowledgeable on lots of subjects. He is very talkative, so it's often difficult to exit a conversation when I need to, but overall he's a pleasant guy who really enjoys socializing. I have learned the best ways to set conversational boundaries kindly but clearly, and we get along fine.\n\nI am a very introverted person. I need a LOT of quiet time to stay sane. I am a stay-at-home parent (we have a 3-year-old) so quiet and solitude is a blessed rarity around our house.\n\nIn the warmer months, we (my husband [30sM], our son, and myself) spend a ton of time in our yard, which I consider our second living room in the spring and summer. It's where we eat, play, and where I do my gardening, which is my one big hobby/passion. Pretty much every time our neighbor hears me hanging out in the yard with my son, he comes over and knocks on the gate. I have let him in to have a short visit a handful of times, and it was fine. \n\nBut after several instances, I found that it was causing me a lot of stress and exhaustion to navigate these visits because A) I had not been expecting to socialize, so half the time I'm in jammies or my son is naked or I'm just plain grumpy because life is busy and tiring; B) I was trying to get things done in my yard, and I'm itching to get back to the task I was focused on; C) I have to also keep one eye on my demanding toddler the whole time, which can already be very draining even without having to socialize simultaneously; D) I was experiencing anxiety going outside because I expecting him to knock at any moment for a nice long chat; E) sometimes we are having a visit with my immediate family or close friends, and we want to spend time with just them; and F) I have to be quite vigilant because I've noticed neighbor does not have a sense of appropriate physical boundaries with my son, who is very friendly and physically affectionate with pretty much everybody. Wants to pick him up like a baby, lets him hug and kiss him and climb all over his lap, etc. He doesn't mean any harm but it's still just an additional thing I need to think about when he's over.\n\nSo I stopped letting him in and just stood at the gate for quick neighborly chats when he would come by. He makes it clear he wants to come inside the yard, but I always have a reason to keep the visit short and light. I say things like, \"We're having some family time/we're eating dinner/we're not feeling great today/we're really busy getting stuff done, so we'll see you another day, but thanks for stopping by!\" But he will come over the next day to see if it's a good time, or he will ask if we can schedule a visit. He will also text me frequently, although I usually do not respond, except on holidays to return well wishes.\n\nI feel un-neighborly saying it, but at the root of all this is that I'm just not interested, or even mentally able, to socialize with an acquaintance this often. I don't even socialize with my own parents this much, and they live two blocks away. My quiet time, privacy, and calm/happy outdoor time with my family are sacred. I have not explained this at length to my neighbor, because I'm not sure how to state it without hurting his feelings. But if I'm completely honest, we do not have anything in common and I am just not interested in having a social relationship with him except occasionally saying hello in passing, like I do with our other neighbors.\n\nMy goal, put frankly, is for him to never knock on our gate at all. For me, it is the equivalent of him knocking on my front door for a visit. I feel like I sound like a horrible callous person for wanting him out of my life, but it's just how I feel and it's the boundary I need. I also can't stand it when people drop by unexpectedly, even people I know really well.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to say that will reach him, since he simply doesn't understand social cues. I like him, I think he's perfectly friendly, and I do not want him to feel badly, because I think it's wonderful that he gets himself out there and socializes. I know he makes the rounds every day with several houses (and I also know another family we're friendly with, his neighbor on the other side, is experiencing the same discomfort that we are). If we have parties where neighbors are invited, he is included. But that is the extent of my desired relationship with him. How can I tell someone, clearly and explicitly but without hurting their feelings, that I don't want them knocking on my door?\n\nTL;DR My [30sF] autistic neighbor [20sM] knocks on my gate for a long chat every time we are outside, several times a week in nice weather, and as an introvert, it is exhausting me. How to set boundaries kindly but firmly?",
    "human": "As an autistic person, just tell him. Literally. Say it. \n\n“Hey, we love you coming around when you come for parties and what not, but we don’t like when you just turn up without a direct invitation. Can you not do that anymore?”",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and boundaries. It's essential to prioritize your own needs and well-being, especially as an introvert. Here's a suggested approach to help you communicate your boundaries to your neighbor:\n\n1. Acknowledge his efforts: Start by acknowledging your neighbor's friendly intentions and efforts to socialize. You can say something like, \"I appreciate your enthusiasm for socializing, and I'm glad you enjoy visiting with us.\"\n2. Express your needs: Clearly state your needs and boundaries. You can say, \"However, I'm an introvert and need some quiet time to recharge. I find it challenging to socialize multiple times a week, especially when I'm not expecting it.\"\n3. Set a specific boundary: Be specific about what you're comfortable with. You can say, \"I'm happy to chat with you briefly when you're out for a walk or passing by, but I need to keep our interactions brief and occasional.\"\n4. Offer alternatives: If you want to maintain some level of connection, suggest alternative ways to interact, such as scheduling a specific visit or activity. For example, \"If you'd like to hang out, we could schedule a specific time and activity, like a walk or a game night.\"\n5. Be firm but polite: Remember to be firm but polite in your communication. Avoid apologetic or hesitant language, which can lead to confusion. Instead, use a clear and direct tone.\n6. Be consistent: Consistency is key when setting boundaries. Ensure you're setting the same boundaries with your neighbor each time he approaches you, so he understands what's acceptable and what's not.\n\nHere's an example script:\n\n\"Hey [Neighbor's Name], I appreciate your enthusiasm for socializing, and I'm glad you enjoy visiting with us. However, I'm an introvert and need some quiet time to recharge. I find it challenging to socialize multiple times a week, especially when I'm not expecting it. I'm happy to chat with you briefly when you're out for a walk or passing by, but I need to keep our interactions brief and occasional. If you'd like to hang out, we could schedule a specific time and activity, like a walk or a game night. Let me know if that works for you, and we can make it happen.\"\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries that work for you. It's okay to say no to social invitations or interactions that drain your energy."

Someone posted on Reddit a while back, I'm sure it was on r/getmotivated saying \"discipline is better than motivation because motivation is fleeting where as discipline is not\" or something very close to that. The quote inspired me to discipline my mind but after a while even that faded. How would I keep this mind set?",
    "human": "Pick an activity that you do not enjoy doing (like reading or pushups).\n\nNow, make a concentrated effort to do it at least once a day.\n\nWhat this does is that it gets your brain in the habit of doing things that are dis-pleasurable, but necessary. It also makes THAT thing the low-point of your day, which makes everything else easier.",
    "base_reply": "I love that quote! It's a great reminder that discipline is a more sustainable foundation for success than motivation. Now, let's dive into how to cultivate and maintain a disciplined mindset.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that discipline is a skill that can be developed over time with consistent practice. Here are some strategies to help you keep your mind disciplined:\n\n1. **Set clear goals**: Identify what you want to achieve and set specific, measurable, and attainable goals. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to maintain momentum.\n2. **Create a routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes time blocks for focused work, self-care, and relaxation. Consistency breeds discipline.\n3. **Use implementation intentions**: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance, and specify when and where you'll perform specific tasks. This helps you create an automatic response to situations.\n4. **Track your progress**: Keep a journal, log, or use a habit-tracking app to monitor your progress. Seeing your achievements can boost motivation and reinforce discipline.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness meditation can help you develop greater self-awareness, allowing you to recognize when your mind is wandering and refocus your attention.\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories to build confidence and reinforce positive habits.\n7. **Identify and challenge your excuses**: Be honest with yourself about why you're not following through on your goals. Challenge those excuses and create a plan to overcome them.\n8. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Eliminate or limit exposure to distractions, negative influences, and people who may undermine your discipline.\n9. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that setbacks are inevitable. Treat yourself with kindness when you slip up, and gently refocus on your goals.\n10. **Make it a habit**: Discipline is like a muscle that needs exercise. Consistently practice the above strategies, and discipline will become a natural part of your daily routine.\n\nRemember, discipline is a journey, not a destination. It's a continuous process of growth, improvement, and refinement. By incorporating these strategies into your daily life, you'll be better equipped to maintain a disciplined mindset and achieve your goals.\n\nKeep in mind that it's normal for motivation to ebb and flow, but with discipline, you'll develop a sense of responsibility and accountability that will help you stay on track."

I also come from a religious family, and while I am now atheist, I think my religious upbringing makes me very heistant to do anything sexual. \n\nAnyway, about 6 months ago, he said that he wanted to start having sex before our 3rd anniversary, and if that didn't happen, he would \"reconsider\" our relationship. I didn't feel ready to have sex yet so I didn't. He asked if I was ready a couple of times but I said no and he didn't push the matter.  We celebrated our 3rd anniversary by going to a concert and dinner and drinks.  Then about 2 weeks later, he broke up with me and I was totally devastated. I literally cried for like 2 days nonstop. I had to spend the night in my mom's room for comfort because I was too sad to stay all alone in my room.  \n\nI know this might all sound silly, but do you all think I acted inappropriately. The reason I'm posting is  because my friends said that when you're dating someone seriously you're expected to have sex, otherwise you're just friends and not really in a relationship.

Your boundaries and decisions about your own body and sexuality are yours to make, and it's completely reasonable that you didn't feel ready for sex. It's not uncommon for people to have different levels of comfort with intimacy, and it's not your responsibility to rush into something that makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\nRegarding your boyfriend's ultimatum, it's understandable that you felt pressured and concerned about his expectations. However, it's not okay for him to break up with you over something that was a personal decision of yours. It's his responsibility to respect your boundaries and decisions, even if they differ from his own.\n\nAs for your friends' comment that you're \"just friends\" if you don't have sex, I think that's a harmful and unrealistic expectation. A relationship is about more than just physical intimacy. It's about emotional connection, trust, communication, and mutual respect. Just because you haven't had sex doesn't mean you're not in a real relationship.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's possible that your boyfriend may have been dishonest with you from the start. When you initially told him you weren't comfortable with sex, he said he was willing to wait, but it seems like he wasn't willing to wait as long as you needed. That's a red flag, and it's okay to recognize that you deserve better.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, heard, and valued.

Gently redirect your focus to the present moment, and remind yourself that their opinions are not your responsibility.\n4. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative self-talk by reframing it in a more positive or neutral light. Instead of \"What will they think of me?\", ask yourself \"What's the worst that could happen?\" or \"Is this thought based on fact or assumption?\"\n5. **Focus on your values**: When you're about to worry about others' opinions, remind yourself of your core values and what's truly important to you. This helps shift your focus away from external validation and towards your own authenticity.\n6. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace the idea that you're always learning and growing. When you make a mistake, view it as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than a reflection of your worth.\n7. **Practice assertiveness**: Learn to communicate your thoughts and feelings assertively, without worrying about others' reactions. This helps build confidence and reduces the need for external validation.\n8. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who support and accept you for who you are. Their positive energy can help counterbalance the negative self-talk.\n9. **Develop a sense of self-worth**: Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and positive qualities. This helps you develop a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on others' opinions.\n10. **Patience and persistence**: Changing your thought patterns takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and remember that it's a process. Celebrate small victories and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up.\n\nRemember, it's not about becoming completely immune to others' opinions, but about developing a healthier relationship with them.

I tried to comfort her, listen, take care of her. But she began to push me away, first with comments like \"you don't care\", then physically. She said that she regrets not pressuring me into having a baby 5 years ago (and finding a house, and more).

You can say, \"I can see that you're really upset, and I'm here for you. I understand that this is a tough time for you.\" Avoid getting defensive or trying to fix the situation immediately.\n2. **Set clear boundaries**: When she pushes you away, it's okay to say, \"I understand you need some space, and I'm here for you when you're ready to talk. I'll give you some time, but I want you to know that I'm here for you.\" This sets a clear boundary while still showing that you care.\n3. **Don't take it personally**: Remember that her behavior is not a reflection of your worth as a partner or a person. Try not to internalize her criticism or accusations. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n4. **Communicate your feelings**: When you're ready, have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. You can say, \"I feel hurt when you push me away, but I understand that you're struggling. I want to be there for you, but I need you to know that I'm not going anywhere. Can we find a way to communicate that works for both of us?\"\n5. **Seek support**: Consider couples therapy or counseling to work through these issues. A professional can help you both develop healthier communication patterns and navigate this challenging time.\n\nRemember, it's not about winning an argument or proving a point; it's about understanding each other's needs and working together to find a solution. Keep in mind that it may take time for your girlfriend to process her emotions and come back to a place of emotional regulation. Be patient, stay consistent, and prioritize your own emotional well-being."

    "human": "Consequences for her actions would be a start. Cut off money, take her phone, call the cops when she commits crimes.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's tough to see a loved one struggling, especially when it feels like they're making choices that might harm themselves. As a caring sibling, it's natural to feel worried and helpless.\n\nFirstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that you can't control your sister's choices. You can only influence her by being a positive force in her life. It's essential to separate your own emotions from the situation and focus on what you can control.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to dictate what she should do, try to understand why she's making these choices. Is she seeking attention, feeling like she doesn't fit in, or trying to rebel against authority? Once you understand the underlying reasons, you might be able to address the root issue.\n\nNext, focus on building a strong, open relationship with your sister. Listen to her without judgment, and share your concerns in a non-accusatory way. Avoid being critical or lecturing, as this can push her further away. Instead, ask open-ended questions that encourage her to reflect on her choices.\n\nIt's also crucial to set clear boundaries and consequences for her actions. As a parent or guardian, it's essential to establish rules and expectations, but also be willing to have ongoing conversations and make adjustments as needed.\n\nAdditionally, consider seeking professional help for your sister. A therapist or counselor can provide her with the tools and support she needs to make better choices and develop healthier relationships.\n\nRemember, it's not your responsibility to fix your sister's problems or change her behavior. Your role is to be a supportive sibling and advocate for her well-being. By being a positive influence, offering guidance, and encouraging her to seek help, you can help her make better choices and build a brighter future.\n\nLastly, take care of yourself during this challenging time. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, so make sure to prioritize your own emotional well-being and seek support if you need it."

My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)\n\nI think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.\n\nThanks for any advice.

Good luck and take care.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of loneliness, judgment, and criticism. I'm here to offer you some genuine advice and support.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and I'm here to listen without judgment. It's understandable that you're struggling to find friends, given the toxic environments you've experienced. It's not your fault, and you don't deserve to be treated poorly.\n\nConsidering your work schedule and the lack of friends, it might be challenging to find people to connect with in person. However, there are other ways to build connections:\n\n1. Online communities: Look for online forums, social media groups, or online support groups focused on topics you're interested in. You can start by searching for groups centered around single mothers, autism, or personal growth. Be cautious, though, and make sure you're comfortable with the tone and content of the group before engaging.\n2. Local events: Even if you can't attend daytime events, you can look for evening or online events in Mankato that align with your interests. This could be book clubs, language exchange programs, or hobby-based groups. You can search online or check local community centers, libraries, or colleges for event listings.\n3. Volunteer work: Volunteering can be a great way to meet like-minded people while doing something meaningful. You can search for organizations in Mankato that align with your values and interests. Even if it's just a few hours a month, it can be a great way to build connections and feel more engaged in your community.\n4. Support hotlines and hotspots: If you're feeling overwhelmed, there are hotlines and hotspots available to talk to someone. You can reach out to organizations like the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) or the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Helpline (1-800-950-6264) for emotional support.\n\nRegarding your feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness, remember that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with social anxiety and feel self-conscious in social situations. It might be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, visualization, or mindfulness exercises, to help you feel more grounded.\n\nLastly, please know that you're not defined by your past or your circumstances. You are a strong, capable person who deserves kindness, respect, and friendship. Don't give up hope – it might take time, but you can build a supportive network around you.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and I'm here to support you. Keep in mind that it's okay to take things at your own pace and focus on your own well-being."

Here are a few alternatives you could consider:\n\n1. **Wrist strap or phone case with a wrist strap**: If you have a phone case with a built-in wrist strap or a separate wrist strap, you can wear it while riding the coasters. This way, your phone will be secure and within reach if you need to use it.\n2. **Small pouch or pouch with a carabiner**: You can look for a small pouch or bag with a carabiner clip that you can attach to your belt loop or a secure spot on your clothes. This will keep your phone close and easily accessible while minimizing the risk of it falling off.\n3. **Waterproof phone case with a lanyard**: If you have a waterproof phone case, you can attach a lanyard to it and wear it around your neck. This way, your phone will be safe and secure, and you can still reach it easily.\n4. **Ask a parent or chaperone to hold your phone**: If you're really worried about your phone getting lost or damaged, you could ask a parent or chaperone to hold onto it for you while you ride the coasters. This way, you'll be reachable in case of an emergency, and your phone will be safe.\n\nAs for the idea of putting your phone under a sweatshirt in a cubby, I understand your concern about the risk of it falling out or getting lost. While it's not the most secure option, if you do decide to use this method, make sure to double-check that your phone is securely tucked away and won't fall out while you're on the ride.\n\nLastly, it's always a good idea to keep your phone close and within reach, especially when you're in a crowded or chaotic environment like a theme park. Just be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a solution that works for you and your friend! Have a blast at the theme park!"

I feel obligated to play it, but video games are meant to be played for fun.

    "base_reply": "The classic conundrum! It's great that you're recognizing the toll it's taking on your well-being and wanting to break free. Here's a gentle nudge to help you reframe your thinking:\n\nRecognize that the memories you've made in World of Warcraft are already yours, regardless of whether you continue playing or not. Those experiences, achievements, and friendships are etched in your mind, and you can always look back on them fondly without feeling obligated to continue playing.\n\nNow, let's tackle the perceived waste of time and money. It's natural to feel that way, but consider this: the time and money you've invested in World of Warcraft have already been spent. You can't get those hours back, but you can use the lessons you've learned to prioritize your time and energy more effectively in the future. You've developed skills, like problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability, that can benefit you in other areas of your life.\n\nAs for the community, it's true that some online communities can be toxic, but it's not a reflection of the game itself. You can choose to limit your interactions or find alternative communities that align with your values. Remember, you don't have to be tied to the same group of people or toxic dynamics.\n\nHere's a thought experiment: Imagine you're looking back on your life 10 years from now. Which memories do you want to cherish? The ones spent stressing over raid schedules, or the ones spent doing something that brings you joy and fulfillment? Prioritize the things that align with your values and bring you happiness.\n\nLastly, consider the concept of sunk cost fallacy. Just because you've invested a lot into World of Warcraft doesn't mean you should continue playing to \"get your money's worth.\" You've already gotten value from the experience, and it's okay to acknowledge that it's time to move on.\n\nTake a deep breath, and remind yourself that it's okay to let go. You can always look back on your experiences in World of Warcraft with fondness, but don't let the fear of \"waste\" hold you back from pursuing a more balanced, fulfilling life."

    "sentence": "How to Not Be Overbearing During a Debate/Argument I was raised by a hard-headed O'Reilly-esque father who believed in Victory by Volume, so I know how frustrating it is to argue/debate with someone like that, but yet I can't seem to help myself from doing the exact same thing. \n\nAs soon as I become impassioned about a subject I lower the pitch of my voice and turn up the volume and speed, making it nearly impossible for other people to get a word in. Then I convince myself that I must finish my train of thought if I'm going to convince anyone of my position, which causes me to spew out 100 smaller arguments within the context of a larger idea (this technique is known as the [Gish Gallop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)). Online it's not so bad b/c people can reread and quote what I've said, but IRL it makes it impossible for others to get a word in or have a constructive dialog. \n\nI hate that I do this and I'm looking for techniques to stop myself. \n\nWhatcha got, Reddit?",
    "human": "Most importantly: know the purpose and the structure of an effective debate.  If your debate fails either one of these, it is not effective, and you should back away.\n\nThe purpose of a debate is to argue a subjective opinion built upon objective facts to convince others your opinion is correct.  If you try to argue a point whose only supporting evidence is other opinions you have, you should have a discussion instead, which is where you just discuss opinions in a relaxed manner.\n\nThe structure of a debate is \"point, counter-point, rebuttal\".  State a single, specific opinion you have, then state some facts that surround it.  Limit each fact to 30 seconds or so, and do not bring up multiple facts at once.  Then, let your opponent respond to that fact.  Then you can discuss your opponent's response, and segue onto the next fact.\n\nBreathe.  Taking a deep breath is the best general advice I can give you.  It punctuates your speech, calms you down, lets you gather your thoughts, and allows your opponent time to respond.\n\nRecognize your audience.  You are almost never trying to convince the person you are debating with that you are right; you are convincing some third party, such as people listening to the discussion that you are right.\n\nPrepare your points.  It is fine if to prove your point you must first say 100 other things, but you have to space them out, let people examine and question each one either individually or in small sets, and let them soak in.  If you find yourself speaking until you are out of breath, make sure you take a nice long inhale, and then let your opponent speak about that.\n\nRemain calm and collected.  If you get angry or even seem that way, people are less inclined to side with you.  Speak level and slowly by practicing your breathing and not getting excited.  If you hear your voice raising, take a deep breath.\n\nFinally, recognize when a debate is futile.  If you are not getting anywhere, the other person is yelling, or they just aren't understanding what you are saying, sometimes it is best to just realize the person is not going to get it and to walk away or change the subject.",
    "base_reply": "The Gish Gallop, a clever technique to overwhelm your opponents, but not so clever when it comes to fostering meaningful conversations. I'm happy to help you break this habit and develop a more constructive approach to debating and arguing.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's okay to be passionate about your ideas, but recognize that it's not about winning an argument, but rather about having a respectful and productive exchange of ideas. Here are some techniques to help you curb your tendency to dominate the conversation:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Make an effort to truly hear what the other person is saying, even if you disagree. Repeat back what you've understood from their perspective to ensure you're on the same page. This will help you focus on the conversation rather than your own thoughts.\n2. **Pause and take a breath**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, pause, take a deep breath, and count to 10. This simple pause can help you regain composure and prevent the urge to launch into a Gish Gallop.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of launching into a barrage of arguments, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share their thoughts and opinions. This will help keep the conversation balanced and foster a sense of collaboration.\n4. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of making accusatory statements or assertions, use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings. This helps to own your opinions and avoid coming across as confrontational.\n5. **Set a timer**: Challenge yourself to limit your responses to a certain time frame (e.g., 30 seconds to 1 minute). This will help you stay focused and prevent you from dominating the conversation.\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Develop mindfulness techniques to become more aware of your emotions and thoughts in the moment. This will help you recognize when you're getting worked up and take steps to manage your emotions before they escalate.\n7. **Seek feedback**: Ask trusted friends or family members to observe your debates and provide feedback on your communication style. They may be able to identify patterns or triggers that contribute to your Gish Galloping and offer suggestions for improvement.\n8. **Seek out diverse perspectives**: Engage with people who have different opinions and beliefs. This will help you develop a thicker skin and learn to appreciate the value of respectful disagreement.\n9. **Focus on understanding**: Instead of trying to \"win\" the argument, focus on understanding the other person's perspective. Ask questions like \"What do you mean by that?\" or \"How did you come to that conclusion?\" to demonstrate your interest in their thoughts.\n10. **Celebrate silence**: Acknowledge that sometimes, silence is a powerful tool. Don't feel the need to fill every moment with words. Allow the other person to have space to think and respond.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With time and effort, you can develop a more constructive approach to debating and arguing, and foster more meaningful conversations with others."

Try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Focus on one task at a time, and give yourself a realistic timeline to complete it. This can help reduce feelings of overwhelm and give you a sense of control.\n3. **Communicate with your team and manager**: Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification on tasks. Your team and manager can provide support and guidance, and it's better to ask early on than to struggle and risk making mistakes.\n4. **Practice deep breathing exercises**: When you start to feel that suffocating sensation, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of the breath, and try to let go of any thoughts or worries. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body.\n5. **Set realistic expectations**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. You're new to the role, and it's normal to not know everything right away. Try to reframe your thinking and focus on what you can control, rather than worrying about what might go wrong.\n6. **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax outside of work. This could be exercise, reading, or spending time with loved ones. Prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself.\n7. **Re-evaluate your workload**: If you're consistently feeling overwhelmed and struggling to keep up, it may be worth discussing your workload with your manager. They may be able to adjust your responsibilities or provide additional support.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's not a reflection of your abilities. With time and practice, you'll become more comfortable in your role and better equipped to handle the demands. Hang in there, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance!"

He just said 'No, but she would be pretty... she's always been in relationships though.‘ That was the end of the conversation.  \nHe apparently didn't end up seeing her because he was too busy. He never mentioned her again for a whole year.\n\nLast week I asked my boyfriend if she would come to his birthday party this summer again and if he ever saw her over the year since he never mentioned her. He reluctantly admitted 'Yes, I might have seen her once or so'. I kept on asking and then it turned out he drove over an hour to spend the evening with her at her parents' house a couple of months ago. I wanted to know why he didn't tell me about it (we ask how each others day went everyday!) and he was just ''I probably just forgot to tell you or I didn't want to make you worry, I don't know\" \"You're making a big deal out of nothing.\" ''Am I not allowed to have pretty female friends'' \"You're being extremely jealous'', “You‘re overreacting“,...  \n\nApart from that, she also came to his parents restaurant with her family twice or so over the year and probably saw him as well.

I want our relationship to work but I can't fully trust him anymore.\n\n\nEdit: Should I tell him I sometimes feel so bad about it it‘s making me consider leaving the relationship?\nEdit Edit: I used to feel really secure in the relationship because I was his first ever girlfriend and the first girl he ever introduced to his family (even though I am sure he had other options) and he made me feel really special. \n\nEdit Edit Edit: I’m currently at my boyfriend’s place and skimmed through their messages... He met up with her in March. She messaged him at 1:30am „Did you get home safely“, he was like „Yes, everything went well“ and she wrote „I had a really nice time with you😊“. He then messaged her about once a month asking her how she‘s doing and inviting her to his events or asking if she wants to meet up but she always cancelled... I didn‘t go any further back than MarchSorry for the length of my postMy friends are telling me I should just forget about this whole situation and not ruin my relationship because of 'jealousy'. Do you think that would be best to do?",
    "human": "Honestly, you’re 23. You’re too young to waste time on people who lie to you like that. Even if it was just lying by omission, it made you feel like shit, right? \n\nThere are plenty of awesome people out there. Don’t waste your early 20s on someone who makes you feel this way.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and frustrations. It's natural to feel upset when you're not being told the truth or feel like you're being kept in the dark. \n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's not just about being jealous. You have a right to know what's going on in your partner's life, especially when it involves an old friend who's a woman.\n\nAs for what to do, I don't think it's wise to just forget about this situation. Ignoring it might lead to more misunderstandings and potentially deeper issues down the line. Instead, I suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns.\n\nBefore talking to him, take some time to gather your thoughts and feelings. Make a list of specific instances that have made you feel uneasy, including the recent discovery and his reactions. This will help you express your concerns more effectively.\n\nWhen you talk to your boyfriend, use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel and avoid blaming or accusing language. For example, \"I feel hurt and betrayed when you don't tell me about your interactions with your friend, even if you consider them platonic. It makes me wonder if there's something going on that you're not telling me.\" \n\nAlso, be specific about what you're looking for in terms of transparency and honesty in your relationship. You can say something like, \"I want us to be able to talk openly about our daily lives, including our interactions with others. Can we make an effort to be more honest with each other in the future?\"\n\nRemember that relationships involve compromise and communication. It's possible that your boyfriend wasn't intentionally trying to keep things from you, but rather was thoughtless or didn't consider the impact of his actions. By having an open conversation, you can work together to find a solution that strengthens your relationship.\n\nRegarding your friends' advice to forget about it, while it might be tempting to move on, ignoring the issue might not address the underlying concerns. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and the health of your relationship.\n\nLastly, it's essential to remember that your boyfriend's past behavior is a reflection of his character, and it's crucial to consider whether you're comfortable with it. If you're not, it might be worth reevaluating the relationship.\n\nRemember, trust is built on transparency, honesty, and open communication. By addressing these issues head-on, you can work towards rebuilding trust and strengthening your relationship."

    "human": "Where I'm at students qualify, and they expanded eligibility because of the pandemic. You might live somewhere different though.",
    "base_reply": "The eternal concern about privacy and government benefits!\n\nYes, it's possible that SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) officials could find out that you're in college if you've filled out a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Here's why:\n\n1. FAFSA reports financial information: When you fill out the FAFSA, you provide information about your income, assets, and other financial details. This information is shared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is responsible for administering the SNAP program.\n2. Cross-checking with other government databases: The USDA cross-checks FAFSA data with other government databases, including those related to social services and benefits programs. This is done to ensure that individuals aren't receiving duplicate benefits or ineligible assistance.\n3. College enrollment verification: Some colleges and universities may also report student enrollment information to the USDA, which could potentially be linked to your FAFSA data.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the USDA doesn't automatically disclose your FAFSA information to SNAP officials. If you're receiving SNAP benefits, you're required to report any changes in your income, household composition, or other relevant information to maintain eligibility.\n\nTo minimize the risk of your college enrollment being discovered, consider the following:\n\n* Be honest and accurate when filling out your FAFSA. Inaccurate information could lead to issues with your financial aid or benefits.\n* If you're receiving SNAP benefits, report your college enrollment and any changes to your income or household situation to your local SNAP office.\n* Remember that SNAP officials are required to maintain confidentiality and only share your information with authorized personnel.\n\nKeep in mind that the USDA and other government agencies have strict privacy and data protection protocols in place. While it's possible that your college enrollment could be discovered, it's unlikely that your information will be shared without a legitimate reason or authorization."

It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially as a recent college grad adjusting to the demands of a \"real\" job. Here are some tactics to help you mentally keep work at work and reduce the creeping thoughts that keep you up at night:\n\n1. **Set clear boundaries**: Establish a clear separation between your work and personal life. Designate a specific time and space for work-related thoughts and activities. This can be as simple as setting a specific time to check work emails or messages, and sticking to it.\n2. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, allowing you to acknowledge and release them without getting caught up in them. You can try apps like Headspace or Calm to get started.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: When you catch yourself dwelling on work-related thoughts, try reframing them in a more positive or neutral light. Instead of \"I'm going to fail tomorrow,\" say \"I'll do my best tomorrow, and I've prepared well for it.\"\n4. **Engage in relaxation techniques**: Regular relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga can help calm your mind and body. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n5. **Schedule self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you unwind, such as reading, exercise, or hobbies. This will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and reduce the likelihood of work creeping into your personal time.\n6. **Communicate with your employer**: If you're consistently struggling to disconnect from work, consider discussing your concerns with your employer or HR department. They may be able to provide support or adjustments to help you better manage your workload and boundaries.\n7. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes – they're an opportunity to learn and grow. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend in a similar situation.\n8. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your workflow and habits to identify areas where you can improve. Make adjustments as needed to reduce stress and increase productivity.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits and thought patterns. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With consistent effort, you can develop a healthier relationship with work and reduce the mental burden of constantly thinking about it outside of work hours."

I'm currently a college student but I had to stop because of some issues.\n\nDuring the first semester in college I was doing fine, just like how a normal student would. I was self studying, attending classes, doing homework and all requirements in class. Then the first semester finals came, there were a lot of projects that was needed to be done, some of them are group projects but I did almost all of it alone. Some of my friends needed my help with their projects and I kindly helped all of them. It was very tiring and stressful, as far as I can remember it was the first and most stressful weeks of my academic life but despite all of the struggles I managed to survive the first semester.\n\nThe second semester started, two to three weeks in I was still doing fine but eventually I became less inspired as day goes by. I slowly stopped doing homework, I stopped attending classes, I feel very drained. Those days of not attending classes became a month, I just stopped doing anything. Every time I try to do some school related stuff all of a sudden I feel sleepy, out of energy and uninterested. I just started avoiding everything that is school related. I had one friend that I talk to often but when he messages me about academics I just ignore his messages, when I feel like his message is gonna be related to academics I immediately stop reading it and not talk to him. I decided to take a rest and quit college but I plan to go back next school year.\n\nI want to catch up and start studying again, but I still feel the same uninspired feeling whenever I try to start again.

It's okay to acknowledge that you needed time to recharge and prioritize your mental health.\n\nTo overcome the feeling of being uninspired and unmotivated, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1. **Identify the reasons behind your lack of inspiration**: Reflect on what led to your burnout in the first place. Was it the intense workload, lack of social support, or something else? Understanding the root cause will help you address it more effectively.\n2. **Set small, achievable goals**: Instead of trying to dive back into your studies headfirst, start with tiny, manageable goals. This could be as simple as setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to review notes, read a chapter, or complete a small assignment. Celebrate your small wins to build momentum.\n3. **Find a study buddy or accountability partner**: Reach out to your friend who you mentioned you still talk to, and ask if they'd be willing to study together or hold each other accountable. Having someone to report to and stay motivated with can be a great motivator.\n4. **Explore new study habits and environments**: Sometimes, a change of scenery or routine can help spark inspiration. Try studying in a different location, or at a different time of day. Experiment with different study habits, such as using flashcards, making concept maps, or creating a schedule.\n5. **Prioritize self-care**: Don't forget to take care of your physical and mental well-being. Make time for activities that bring you joy, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. A healthy body and mind are essential for academic success.\n6. **Seek additional support**: If you're struggling to get back into the swing of things, consider seeking help from a counselor, academic advisor, or tutor. They can help you develop a plan to get back on track and provide additional support.\n7. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to not feel motivated all the time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Take things one step at a time, and focus on progress rather than perfection.\n\nLastly, I'd like to reassure you that it's okay to take your time and not rush back into academics. You've already taken a break, and it's essential to ensure you're ready to dive back in at your own pace.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle, and it's okay to ask for help. You got this!"

Currently 30, no kids nor money, mediocre Econ degree.\n\nI have a great family - my parents both passed so my older brothers and sister are all I have as immediate family. They are very talented and hard working and I look up to them (always have as a kid). They are supportive and always include me in their plans, but I just feel like I do nothing but bring them down and everyone around me. They know I struggle inside and care very much, I just feel like I waste their time and energy that could be better spent with better company. I’m not fun nor interesting but my siblings are all pros at their craft and deserve a better friend/little brother that is capable of sharing the excitement they have.\n\nIt’s like all I want to do is drink and be alone. I don’t really want to, but I feel like it’s all I know and good for. I don’t want to die but feel like the world would be better off and my family would be better off too.

I’m a late 30s single guy, no kids, depressed my whole life, instead of trying to “beat” it or run from it, learn how to embrace it, refocus those feelings and energy into something good, fun, enjoyable. Embrace your crazy.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles, and I'm here to listen and offer some guidance.\n\nFirstly, let's address the myth that you're a burden to your family. This is not true. Your family loves and cares about you, and they're happy to have you as a part of their lives. Your worth and value as a person are not defined by your accomplishments or your contributions to your family's success. You are worthy and deserving of love and respect simply because you exist.\n\nIt's understandable that you feel like you're not living up to your family's expectations, but remember that everyone has their own struggles and imperfections. Your siblings may be talented and hardworking, but they also have their own challenges and doubts. No one is immune to feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt, and it's okay to acknowledge and work through those feelings.\n\nRegarding your desire to drink and be alone, I want to caution you that this might be a coping mechanism, but it's not a sustainable solution to your problems. While it may provide temporary relief, it can also lead to more harm and negative consequences in the long run. Instead, consider seeking out healthier ways to cope with your emotions, such as talking to a therapist, engaging in a hobby you enjoy, or practicing mindfulness and self-care.\n\nLastly, I want to remind you that your family wants to be there for you, and they're willing to support you through your struggles. They may not be perfect, but they love you unconditionally, and they want to help you find your own path and purpose.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of focusing on what you're not, try to focus on what you are. What are your strengths and passions? What brings you joy and fulfillment? What are your goals and aspirations? Write down your thoughts and feelings, and start exploring ways to work towards making positive changes in your life.\n\nRemember, you are not a burden to your family. You are a valuable member of their lives, and you deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, and understanding."

I love music and it feels like what I was made to do. I believe I can make it with hard work. But people tell me I won't make it and I should just give up on my lifelong dream. Should I listen to them or should I follow my dreams? Any advise?",

    "base_reply": "The age-old debate: should you follow your passion or listen to the naysayers? Let me tell you, my friend, it's a tough one. But I'll give you some honest advice.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're passionate about music and have a talent for it. It's amazing that you play three instruments and sing – that's no small feat! However, it's also important to acknowledge that the music industry is highly competitive, and success is not guaranteed, even with hard work.\n\nNow, about those discouraging people... It's natural to get feedback from others, and sometimes it can be tough to take. But here's the thing: their opinions are often based on their own biases, fears, and limitations. They might not understand your passion, your talent, or your dedication. So, take their words with a grain of salt.\n\nHere's what I want you to do: take a step back, reflect on your own feelings and goals. Ask yourself:\n\n* Why do I want to be a professional musician? Is it because I genuinely love it, or is it because I want to impress others or seek validation?\n* What are my strengths and weaknesses as a musician? What can I improve on, and how can I work on those areas?\n* What's my definition of success in the music industry? Is it fame, fortune, or something else?\n\nOnce you've reflected on these questions, you'll have a better understanding of your own motivations and goals. Then, you can make a decision that's right for you.\n\nIf you're still passionate about pursuing a career in music, don't let the naysayers discourage you. Keep working on your craft, networking, and building your skills. You might need to adapt, pivot, or even change your approach, but that's all part of the journey.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're doing it solely for external validation or to impress others, it might be time to reevaluate your priorities. Maybe there are other ways to express your creativity or make a living that would bring you more fulfillment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take risks and face rejection. It's okay to fail. It's okay to not make it. But it's not okay to let others dictate your dreams. You're the only one who knows what's best for you.\n\nSo, should you follow your dreams or listen to the naysayers? I say, follow your heart, but also be realistic and prepared for the challenges ahead. And always keep in mind that success is not solely defined by external validation – it's about finding joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose in what you do."

    "base_reply": "The old \"nervous shake\" conundrum! I'm glad you're aware of it and willing to work on it. Since you're already mentally composed, it's more about managing your physical responses. Here are some tips to help you reduce or manage your shaking:\n\n1. **Deep breathing exercises**: Practice deep, slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four. Repeat this process several times.\n2. **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. This can help release physical tension.\n3. **Physical awareness**: When you start to feel the shakes coming on, become aware of your physical sensations. Notice the sensation of your body trembling, but don't focus on it too much. Instead, redirect your attention to your breath or a calming thought.\n4. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself feeling calm and confident. Visualize the situation unfolding smoothly, and yourself handling it with ease. This can help your body respond more positively.\n5. **Prepare in advance**: For high-stress situations like presentations, try to prepare as much as possible beforehand. Rehearse your presentation several times, and focus on the content rather than your nervousness.\n6. **Get moving**: Engage in some light physical activity before the situation, like a short walk or some stretching. This can help release tension and calm your nerves.\n7. **Self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to feel nervous, and it doesn't define your worth. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.\n8. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness meditation or focus on the present moment during the situation. This can help you stay grounded and centered.\n9. **Caffeine and nicotine**: Be mindful of your caffeine and nicotine intake before a stressful situation. Both can exacerbate nervousness and shaking.\n10. **Seek professional help**: If your shaking persists or is severe, consider consulting a healthcare professional or a therapist. They can help you identify underlying causes and develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember, it may take some time and practice to develop new habits and reduce your shaking. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Good luck!"

Going to a bar alone can be intimidating, but with some preparation and a positive attitude, you can increase your chances of having a great time and potentially meeting someone.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the elephant in the room - social anxiety. It's normal to feel nervous when you're in a new environment, especially if you're not used to going out alone. But here's the thing: most people are too caught up in their own conversations to even notice you're alone. So, try not to be too hard on yourself if you don't get instant attention.\n\nHere are some tips to help you feel more comfortable and confident:\n\n1. **Dress to impress**: Wear something that makes you feel good about yourself. It doesn't have to be fancy, but make sure you're dressed in a way that's presentable and reflects your personality.\n2. **Choose a quieter bar**: If you're new to going out alone, it's better to start with a smaller, more low-key bar. Avoid super crowded places where it's hard to hold a conversation.\n3. **Know your limits**: As a new drinker, it's essential to pace yourself and not overdo it. Order a drink you're comfortable with, and take your time enjoying it.\n4. **Be open-minded**: Don't go in with high expectations. You're not going to meet someone who's perfect for you on your first try. Just focus on having a good time and being yourself.\n5. **Strike up a conversation**: If you see someone sitting alone or looking lost, try striking up a conversation. You can ask them about their favorite drink or the music playing. This can be a great way to break the ice and build a connection.\n6. **Be patient**: It may take some time for you to feel comfortable and relaxed. Don't get discouraged if you don't get instant attention. Just focus on enjoying your drink and the atmosphere.\n7. **Leave your phone alone**: Try not to be glued to your phone. Put it on silent mode and keep it out of sight. This will help you focus on the present moment and be more approachable.\n\nRemember, the goal is to have a good time and be yourself. Don't worry too much about what others think. If you do happen to meet someone, great! If not, that's okay too. You're still having a great time, and who knows, you might meet someone in the future.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't meet someone.

It's frustrating when you feel like your ideas are being ignored or dismissed, especially when you're aware that someone else is getting recognition for similar ideas.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the confidence issue. It's normal to feel uncertain about sharing your ideas, especially if you're not used to doing so. But here's the thing: your ideas are valuable, and they're worth sharing. Instead of focusing on the fear of being laughed at, try reframing it to focus on the value you can bring to the table. Remember that your colleagues and superiors are not necessarily trying to tear you down; they're just trying to get the best solutions for the project.\n\nNow, about thinking outside the box. It's great that you're good at taking requirements and turning them into reality. However, to take your skills to the next level, you need to challenge yourself to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions. Here are a few tips to help you do that:\n\n1. **Set aside dedicated time for brainstorming**: Schedule a specific time each week or month to think about new ideas and solutions. This can be as simple as dedicating 30 minutes to freewriting or mind mapping.\n2. **Read industry blogs and books**: Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in your field. This will help you stay inspired and come up with fresh ideas.\n3. **Collaborate with others**: Working with colleagues from different departments or industries can help you see things from a different perspective and come up with innovative solutions.\n4. **Embrace failure**: It's okay to try new things and fail. In fact, failure is often a stepping stone to success. Don't be afraid to take calculated risks and learn from your mistakes.\n\nNow, about speaking up in meetings. Here's a strategy that might help:\n\n1. **Prepare beforehand**: Think about the meeting topics and come up with a few ideas beforehand. Write them down and practice articulating them clearly.\n2. **Start with a question**: Instead of launching into an idea, ask a question or challenge a statement made by someone else. This can help you build credibility and show that you're engaged with the discussion.\n3. **Focus on the problem, not the idea**: Instead of presenting your idea as a solution, focus on the problem you're trying to solve. Explain the issues you see and how your idea addresses them.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to receive feedback, even if it's not what you want to hear. Constructive criticism can help you improve and refine your ideas. Don't take it personally and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nKeep in mind that building confidence takes time, and it's a process. Start small, focus on your strengths, and gradually work on developing your creative problem-solving skills. You got this!"

He didn’t invite me nor ask if I wanted to plan on  seeing them when they visit.  But he’s making plans for his ex Rockette gf to hang out with them and take pictures together? \n\nI was angry and jealous and communicated that I felt it was inappropriate and awkward for me but again, he didn’t understand why.  He said sorry again &amp; didn’t consider it would bother me.  He asked if I wanted him to stop talking to her but I don’t want to be controlling or put in that position so of course I said no.  \n\nI’m battling between if this is my issue with insecurity &amp; jealously or if he was wrong and is disrespecting me.  My friends all seem to be just as, if not more upset than I am about it but they’re biased.  I want to see it from all sides. \n\nTL;DR: Bf reached out to hot ex gf Rockette to meet his visiting family &amp; give them a tour when he made no plans with me to see them.",
    "human": "From what you've described, I kinda get a selfish vibe from your BF if it has anything to do with the ex. He's being insensitive to your feelings concerning her, and I almost think (because it is total speculation) that he wanted you to say you didn't want him to see her anymore. That way, you are the bad guy. If it was an honest offer, he would've stated that he won't see her because he knows it makes you uncomfortable instead of putting it on you to make a decision. There are unresolved feelings between them that need to be addressed until you and he can move forward. I am sorry you're going through this. It sucks.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a tough spot to be in. I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and consider all sides of the situation.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel hurt, jealous, and uncomfortable in this situation. Your boyfriend's actions, although unintentional, do raise some red flags. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to be left out of plans with his family, especially when you're considering a future together.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that his lack of consideration and understanding of your feelings is a pattern you've noticed in the past. This might be a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nNow, let's consider your boyfriend's perspective. It's possible that he genuinely didn't think it was a big deal, but that's not an excuse for not considering your feelings. His apology, although sincere, might not be enough to make up for the hurt and exclusion.\n\nYou're right to question whether this is your issue with insecurity and jealousy or if your boyfriend is indeed disrespecting you. I think it's a bit of both. It's natural to feel insecure in a situation like this, but it's also important to acknowledge that your boyfriend's actions are contributing to those feelings.\n\nWhat I would suggest is having a calm and open conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Try to avoid blaming or accusing language, and instead, focus on how his actions made you feel. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about your plans with your family and your ex. I felt really left out and hurt when I found out you were making plans with her without involving me. I understand that it might not have been intentional, but it felt like you weren't considering my feelings. I want to work through this together and figure out how we can move forward in a way that makes us both feel comfortable and respected.\"\n\nRemember to listen to his perspective as well, and try to understand where he's coming from. It's possible that he didn't realize the impact of his actions, and a conversation can help clear the air.\n\nLastly, take some time to reflect on whether this is a deal-breaker for you. Ask yourself if you're willing to work through these issues with your boyfriend, or if you feel like this is a sign of a deeper problem in the relationship. Only you can answer that, but I hope this helps you consider all sides of the situation."

I always seem to be the person who doesn't get the new phone until a few months later because I'm under contract.  I don't want to purchase the phone upfront but I'll happily pay x amount per month.  Would it be a good idea to have a one month rolling contract (£13) until a new Phone comes out worth having - also meaning that if Apple for example release another in a year's time, I'll be at the end of my contract and be able to get it straight away.\n\nAny dates been released for new phones, or a trend when phones do come out?",

    "base_reply": "The eternal conundrum of being tied to a contract!\n\nRenewing your contract in April is a good idea, considering you're due for an upgrade. However, considering your concerns about being late to the party, a rolling contract might be a good option for you. The £13/month plan sounds like a reasonable compromise.\n\nAs for new phone releases, Apple typically announces their new iPhone models in September, with pre-orders starting in the same month and availability in September or early October. Samsung usually follows suit, releasing their latest flagships in August or September.\n\nIf you renew your contract in April, you'll likely be able to get the latest iPhone (or Samsung Galaxy series) in September or October, which is a great time to upgrade.\n\nBefore committing to the rolling contract, consider the following:\n\n1. Check the fine print: Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of the rolling contract, including any potential price increases or changes to the monthly rate.\n2. Calculate the costs: Compare the total cost of the rolling contract over a year to your current contract and the cost of upgrading to the latest phone when it's released. You might be surprised at how the math adds up.\n3. Weigh the benefits: If you're happy with your current phone and don't feel the need for the latest and greatest, it might be more cost-effective to stick with your current device and upgrade when you're due for a contract renewal.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to weigh your options carefully and consider what works best for your budget and needs."

    "sentence": "I could use some advice on a situation I’m in with a girl I’m seeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live on the west coast and ended up meeting a girl and going on a date with her. I’ve been on many dates and within 15 minutes I knew this one was special. We connected and vibed incredibly well and ended up spending the night and morning/afternoon together before I had to fly out. By the end, we were talking about not knowing how to go back to our normal lives after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn’t talk for a few weeks, but I eventually reached out and we had a proper phone call for 2 hours that re-ignited the spark I felt when seeing her. After that call we talked by text or phone nearly every day. I have a very high standard for people I date and felt really comfortable with her. We lived on different sides of the country so we knew this was special to still be giving things a shot. 2 weeks after the phone call, I bought tickets to see her along with family in 4 weeks. I saw her for a weekend, spent a week with family, then planned on spending a week with her after that (turned into 2). Things went very well and felt really good and for the first time in a very long time I felt like I was falling for somebody. The first weekend felt incredible and very romantic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward about a month after that visit, I was staying with her again and we talked about monogamy (for the 2nd time - I proposed it at the end of the 2 week visit and she said she wasn’t comfortable with that yet, even though she was only seeing me). During that talk, I asked her the last time she slept with somebody else, and she said it was sometime after we started talking. That was fine by me. I decided to stop seeing anybody else the day after our phone call, because I really felt like this was special). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days after that, she told me that she had miscalculated the days, and slept with somebody in-between my visits. She was seeing this person casually (the guy wanted more) from around the same time we started talking on the phone, up until their last visit after I flew out the first time, and flew back the 2nd time. She said she really didn’t want to the last time, but “logically” she needed to make sure I was right for me by sleeping with him one last time (??).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHearing this crushed me. She consistently told me and made me feel like she was only thinking about me and I genuinely thought this might be a start of something really serious. Turns out everybody in her friend group and even the guy knew she was seeing 2 people at once. Everybody but me. She told me it was because she was scared, which is understandable, but upsetting to know she wasn’t ever going to tell me this without me prying. I feel like she was taking advantage of the grey area and would do so in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve also thought about the fact that this was either a massive miscalculation or she lied to me the first time we talked about it. Either route feels awful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve been struggling with this for weeks and don’t know what to do. I don’t get feelings easily and felt like I was in the clouds with this girl, and haven’t felt that way since hearing this. When I’m with her things usually feel good, but 45 minute after she flew out, the feeling came right back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a way back from here? Is it even worth it? I feel like there’s somebody who would treat me with the respect I deserve, but I also do feel like she’s really trying to be a good partner now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr\\*\\*: Girl I was falling for was sleeping with somebody while we were falling for each other and even after I flew to see her.

You seem to be way overthinking this relationship and have your head in the clouds a bit. It’s new. You’re both single people. It’s okay to be excited, but to place silent expectations on her to not sleep with other people is unfair to her.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're struggling with the revelation and feeling hurt.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's completely reasonable to feel upset and betrayed by her actions. It's not okay that she didn't disclose her situation to you earlier and continued to see someone else while still pursuing a connection with you.\n\nRegarding whether there's a way back from here, it's essential to consider your own feelings and boundaries. You've shared that you have a high standard for people you date, and it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being. You deserve to be respected and honesty in a relationship.\n\nWhile it's great that she's acknowledging her mistakes and trying to be a good partner now, it's essential to consider whether her actions can be trusted in the future. Her decision to sleep with someone else while still seeing you raises red flags about her commitment to monogamy and honesty.\n\nIt's also important to think about the fact that she didn't tell you the truth initially, and it took you prying to get the information out of her. This lack of transparency can be a significant issue in a relationship.\n\nIf you're considering giving her another chance, I would encourage you to take the time to reflect on what you want from a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. You may want to ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you willing to work through the trust issues and uncertainty that come with her past behavior?\n2. Are you comfortable with the possibility that she might not be fully committed to monogamy?\n3. Can you forgive her for her actions and move forward, or do you need more closure and distance?\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. If you do decide to give her another chance, it's essential to set clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship moving forward. However, if you're unsure or feel that the relationship isn't worth the risk, it might be best to prioritize your own emotional well-being and move on.\n\nRemember, you deserve respect, honesty, and commitment in a relationship. Take the time you need to think about what's best for you."

Don't wake up in the morning thinking \"I'm going to talk to someone about X\" be passive, you see someone wearing a t-shirt with a cool design or a movie reference, or they're reading a book that you like or are interested in or have suggestions for other books, or maybe have a cup or bag of popcorn from a movie theater, build your conversation based off of what the person is showing to other people, not what you want to talk about.",
    "base_reply": "Starting conversations with strangers can be intimidating, but with some practice and strategy, it can become more manageable. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Before entering a social situation, think about current events, popular books or movies, or common interests that can serve as conversation starters.\n2. **Start small**: Begin with simple, lighthearted topics like the weather, a recent event, or a question about someone's weekend. This can help ease the tension and create a friendly atmosphere.\n3. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to the other person and show genuine interest in their thoughts and experiences. This will help you build rapport and keep the conversation flowing.\n4. **Find common ground**: Look for shared interests or experiences that can serve as a conversation anchor. This can be a great way to establish a connection and build a sense of camaraderie.\n5. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in any conversation. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere.\n6. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice starting conversations, the more comfortable you'll become. Try striking up conversations with strangers in low-stakes settings, like in line at the grocery store or at a coffee shop.\n7. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes or no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves. This can help keep the conversation going and create a sense of mutual interest.\n8. **Be willing to be vulnerable**: Share a personal anecdote or thought, and be willing to listen to others doing the same. This can help create a sense of trust and intimacy in the conversation.\n9. **Don't take it personally**: Not every conversation will go smoothly, and that's okay. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to continue the conversation or seems uninterested. Just move on and try again with someone else.\n10. **Follow up**: If you hit it off with someone, make sure to follow up and stay in touch. This can help turn a casual conversation into a meaningful friendship.\n\nAs for making friends with strangers, here are a few additional tips:\n\n1. **Join a group or club**: Find a group that aligns with your interests and attend events or meetups. This can be a great way to meet like-minded people who share your passions.\n2. **Volunteer**: Volunteering for a cause you care about can be a great way to meet new people who share your values and interests.\n3. **Take a class or workshop**: Sign up for a class or workshop that interests you, and engage with others who share your curiosity.\n4. **Attend events**: Look for events in your community that align with your interests, such as concerts, festivals, or book readings. These can be great opportunities to meet new people.\n\nRemember, making friends takes time and effort, but it's possible. Be patient, stay positive, and keep putting yourself out there. Good luck!"

We've all said something we regret at some point or another. It's a normal part of being human.\n\nNow, to help you let go of those \"dumb things,\" I want to challenge a few assumptions. You might be thinking that you're the only one who remembers or cares about what you said, but the truth is, people often forget about our mistakes or don't even notice them in the first place. And even if they do remember, it's usually not as big of a deal as we make it out to be.\n\nHere's a strategy that might help:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: When you catch yourself replaying those \"dumb things\" in your head, try to reframe the situation. Instead of beating yourself up over it, acknowledge that you made a mistake, and that it's okay. Remind yourself that you're human and that everyone makes mistakes.\n2. Focus on the present: When something triggers that feeling of embarrassment, take a deep breath and refocus on the present moment. Ask yourself what you're grateful for, what you're looking forward to, or what you're proud of. This helps shift your attention away from the past and towards the present.\n3. Write it down: Sometimes putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper can help us process and release them. Try writing down those \"dumb things\" and then ripping up the paper or deleting the document. This can be a symbolic way of letting go.\n4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga can help you stay present and focused on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past.\n5. Seek support: Share your concerns with a trusted friend or family member. Sometimes talking through our worries with someone who cares about us can help us gain perspective and feel less alone.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to erase the past or pretend it never happened, but to learn from those experiences and move forward. You are not defined by your mistakes, and you are more than capable of growing and learning from them.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything that resonates with you, or is there something else you'd like to add?"

People who engage in gossip often do so to make themselves feel more important or to gain social status.\n2. **Lack of empathy**: When someone consistently shows no interest in others' feelings or struggles, it can be a sign of emotional unavailability. If they dismiss or minimize others' problems, it might indicate a lack of empathy.\n3. **Manipulation and guilt-tripping**: Watch out for people who try to control or manipulate others through guilt, anger, or self-pity. They might use emotional blackmail to get what they want.\n4. **Inconsistencies and dishonesty**: Be wary of people who frequently change their stories, lie, or exaggerate. Dishonesty can be a sign of a lack of integrity.\n5. **Passive-aggressive behavior**: If someone frequently makes backhanded comments, gives the silent treatment, or does things to make you feel uncomfortable, it's a sign of passive-aggression.\n6. **No boundaries**: Pay attention to people who disregard others' boundaries, constantly ask for favors, or try to invade your personal space. Respect for others' boundaries is essential in any relationship.\n7. **Negative self-talk and negativity**: If someone frequently talks down about themselves, others, or the world, it can be a sign of low self-esteem or a negative outlook. Avoid people who spread negativity and toxic vibes.\n8. **Inability to apologize or take responsibility**: When someone consistently blames others, makes excuses, or refuses to apologize for their mistakes, it can indicate a lack of accountability.\n9. **Lack of self-awareness**: If someone shows no willingness to learn from their mistakes, admit their flaws, or work on personal growth, it might be a sign of stagnation and complacency.\n10. **Unrealistic expectations**: Be cautious of people who set unrealistic expectations or put pressure on others to meet their needs.

Trust your instincts and prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you notice any of these signs, take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship.\n\nAs for making new friends and finding a girlfriend, focus on building genuine connections with people who share your values, interests, and sense of humor.

It was a multiple day affair with someone she’s harbored feelings for, and it happened while her husband was out of town.\n\nMy sister is 10 years older than me (24F) and we are incredibly close. I have always looked up to her — put her on a pedestal, even — so this is devastating to me. I love her husband like my own brother and I’m devastated for him, too. He doesn’t know. No one knows but me. I did my best to be supportive and encouraged her to tell him, but she said she couldn’t do it. \n\nThis has been weighing on me so heavily for more than 24 hours. My sister swore me to secrecy so I haven’t even told my own husband. I want to tell him but I feel trapped by my loyalty to my sister.

You've done your part by being supportive and encouraging her to be honest with her husband. Now, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and consider what's best for your relationship with your husband.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I would suggest telling your husband as soon as possible. Withholding this information from him for an extended period can lead to feelings of mistrust and potentially damage your relationship. It's better to be open and honest with each other, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nWaiting until after the family event might seem like a way to avoid an awkward situation, but it's essential to remember that honesty is always the best policy. You're not obligated to keep your sister's secret, and your husband has a right to know what's going on.\n\nIt's also important to consider that your sister's husband might find out eventually, and when he does, he'll likely be hurt and angry. By keeping the secret, you're essentially enabling your sister to avoid taking responsibility for her actions. It's crucial to respect your sister's autonomy and allow her to make her own decisions, even if they're difficult.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but I urge you to prioritize your own relationship and well-being. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your concerns and feelings. Remember that you're not betraying your sister by telling your husband; you're simply being honest about what's going on.\n\nTake a deep breath, be honest with yourself, and do what you think is right for your relationship."

    "sentence": "My girlfriends baby daddy just got a new job and put the child on his insurance. Her insurance won’t let her drop him as it’s not a “qualifying life event”. So she has to keep unnecessary insurance (730/month). Any thoughts on how she can drop the insurance for the child?",
    "human": "Yes she can. I work for an insurance company and obtaining other coverage is a qualifying event.",
    "base_reply": "What a tricky situation! I understand your girlfriend's frustration. Unfortunately, insurance companies can be rigid when it comes to qualifying life events. That being said, there might be a few potential solutions to explore:\n\n1. **Contact the insurance company directly**: Sometimes, a polite and detailed conversation with the insurance company can lead to an exception or a special arrangement. Your girlfriend can explain the situation, highlighting the financial burden of keeping the insurance and the fact that the child is no longer dependent on her income. She can also ask if there's a possibility of a temporary waiver or a reduced premium.\n2. **Check for other qualifying life events**: Although the insurance company might not consider the new job as a qualifying life event, there might be other events that could trigger a change. For example, if your girlfriend's income has decreased significantly due to the new job, she could argue that this is a qualifying life event. She can also check if there have been any changes in her employment status, such as a reduction in hours or a change in job status.\n3. **Explore alternative insurance options**: If the insurance company is unwilling to make an exception, your girlfriend might need to consider alternative insurance options. She could look into short-term insurance plans, catastrophic plans, or even Medicaid (if eligible). These options might not be ideal, but they could provide some financial relief.\n4. **Negotiate with the baby daddy**: This might be a tough conversation, but your girlfriend could try to discuss the situation with the baby daddy. If he's aware of the financial burden she's facing, he might be willing to help find a solution or even take on the insurance costs himself.\n5. **Consider a COBRA option**: If the insurance company is unwilling to make an exception, your girlfriend might be eligible for COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) coverage. COBRA allows her to temporarily continue her current insurance plan for a limited time. This might not be the most cost-effective option, but it could provide some coverage until she finds a better solution.\n\nIt's essential for your girlfriend to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider her financial situation before making a decision. I hope these suggestions help her find a more affordable solution."

    "base_reply": "Whoa, that's a shock! First, take a deep breath and don't panic. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you tackle this unexpected expense:\n\n1. **Contact your doctor/hospital**: Reach out to the medical provider and explain your situation. They might be willing to work with you to set up a payment plan or offer financial assistance. Be honest about your financial constraints, and they may be more understanding than you think.\n2. **Check for financial assistance programs**: Look into programs like Medicaid, CHIP, or state-specific programs that can help with medical expenses. You can also explore non-profit organizations that provide financial assistance for medical bills.\n3. **Negotiate with the billing department**: Call the billing department and ask if they can waive or reduce the bill. Be prepared to provide proof of your financial situation and explain why you're unable to pay the full amount.\n4. **Consider a hardship program**: Some medical providers offer hardship programs that can reduce or forgive debt for patients who are experiencing financial difficulties.\n5. **Apply for a medical credit card or financing**: If you need to pay the bill immediately, consider applying for a medical credit card or financing option. Be cautious, as these often come with high interest rates.\n6. **Reach out to a patient advocacy group**: Non-profit organizations like Patient Advocate Foundation or National Patient Advocate Foundation can provide guidance and support in navigating the healthcare system and negotiating with providers.\n7. **Prioritize your spending**: Review your budget and make adjustments to free up some cash flow. You might need to cut back on discretionary spending or find ways to increase your income.\n8. **Seek professional help if needed**: If you're overwhelmed or struggling to manage debt, consider consulting a credit counselor or financial advisor.\n\nRemember, communication is key. Be open and honest about your financial situation, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Take care of yourself, and don't let this unexpected expense derail your financial well-being."

    "sentence": "How do I stop arguing on the Internet and caring what others think?  Apologies if this isn't the correct sub.\n\nMy problem is that I tend to try and correct people that make generalizations about my country. I know my country has several flaws, but I don't like generalizations. Might seem like a patriotic trait, but I'm not very patriotic. I guess you could call me a bit *selfish* because my primary intention is that I don't want people to hate me simply because of my nationality, I didn't choose my birthplace.\n\nAnd to make things worse, I've noticed a certain group of people deliberately spreading misinformation on various sites (including Reddit), and so I tend to reply and call them out for trying to misinform people, because I don't want random people to end up reading their propaganda and then hating me (based on my nationality) for it.\n\nThe past few years have been a downward spiral for me, and this lockdown has made it worse. I've reached my lowest point and my past few days have just been nothing but sadness and despair. How do I stop caring what other people think? I see the people around me and most of them have no clue about the types of things people say on the Internet, they're just happy the way they are and I wish I were the same.",

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you reached out for help. It's understandable that you're struggling with this issue, and I'm here to offer some guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're aware of your motivations and willing to acknowledge your concerns. Recognizing that your primary intention is to protect yourself from being judged or hated based on your nationality is a significant step forward.\n\nTo address your concerns about correcting people who make generalizations about your country, here's a suggestion: instead of directly correcting them, try to focus on sharing your personal experiences and perspectives. Share stories about your country, its culture, and its people in a positive light. This can help to humanize your country and show that it's not a one-dimensional entity. By sharing your personal stories, you can help to break down stereotypes and misconceptions.\n\nRegarding the misinformation spreaders, it's understandable that you want to correct them, but it's essential to approach this situation carefully. Instead of directly calling them out, try to focus on providing accurate information in a neutral and respectful manner. You can do this by sharing credible sources, statistics, and facts that contradict the misinformation. Avoid being confrontational or aggressive, as this can escalate the situation and make it less productive.\n\nNow, about not caring what others think: it's a challenging goal, but it's achievable with practice and self-reflection. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Acknowledge that it's okay to have flaws and that you're doing the best you can.\n2. Focus on your values: Identify what's truly important to you and focus on aligning your actions and decisions with those values. This can help you prioritize what matters most and reduce your concern about what others think.\n3. Limit your online presence: Consider taking a break from social media or limiting your online interactions to reduce your exposure to toxic or negative commentary. Focus on nurturing positive relationships and connections in your offline life.\n4. Cultivate mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to increase your self-awareness and reduce your emotional reactivity to online criticism.\n5. Seek support: Surround yourself with people who support and uplift you, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel sad and overwhelmed. It's normal to struggle with the negativity and toxicity of the internet. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.\n\nRemember, small steps can lead to significant changes. Start by making tiny adjustments to your online behavior and focus on cultivating a more positive and compassionate mindset. You got this!"

There have been multiple instances when she was about to come to my place and, knowing she’s used to bring something whenever she comes by, I specifically told her not to bring anything. My reasons don’t matter here, and I figured if she really cares about my wishes and respects me as a person, she will not do it, but, nonetheless, I do it because I can afford almost anything (reasonable) I want, she has a way smaller pension than I have a salary (and she used to manage twice as much a monthly income before her mother, my great-grandma with Alzheimer’s, passed away; she tries to save as much money as possible and is currently on a deficit from then), some (or most, to be honest) of the items she buys aren’t among my preferences, and I feel frustrated that she spends money on things which don’t bring me joy, etc. \n\nBut last time, I wanted to buy her something for lunch, I called her to ask if she’s okay with it, she agreed and then I, again, told her to not bring anything. She brought two bags of sweets and drinks. As soon as I saw that, I got reaaaally upset and left the room to get a nap, because I was starting to feel sick from anger. I felt as if she doesn’t give a shit about my wishes and doesn’t respect me as a person.\n\nToday, a few days after that event, she called and we discussed about that happening. I got furious again when she said that I’m too proud to accept things from her. I told her I’ve decided to stop buying anything to her, without having wanted to do so, because I want to avoid these kinds of situations where she buys things to me or wants to pay me back, primarily to also stop her buying anything to me. She added that she understands this has strained our relationship and that we won’t be communicating from now on due to his, even though that’s not what I said and what I meant.\n\nI care about my grandma, even though she’s so difficult to deal with sometimes, but the fact that she appears to not respect my wishes makes me isolate from her. Is there anything else to be done in order to resuscitate the relationship, while also having mutual respect for each other?\n\nTL;DR: Grandma doesn’t seem to respect me and keeps on buying things even though I asked her not to, and I don’t know what to do to fix this.",

    "base_reply": "I can sense the frustration and hurt you're feeling. It's understandable that you want to set boundaries and have your wishes respected, especially when it comes to something as simple as not wanting to receive gifts.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your grandma's behavior might stem from a place of love and a desire to show her affection, even if it's misguided. It's possible that she's not intentionally trying to disrespect you, but rather, she's not considering your feelings or boundaries.\n\nTo address this, you might want to try having an open and honest conversation with your grandma. Instead of focusing on what you don't want, try framing the conversation around what you do want. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey Grandma, I love when you come to visit and spend time with me. I appreciate your thoughtfulness in bringing gifts, but sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable when you do it without asking me first. I understand that you're trying to show your love and appreciation, but it would mean a lot to me if you asked me beforehand or respected my wishes when I tell you not to bring anything. Can we find a way to balance your desire to show your love with my need for personal space and respect?\"\n\nThis approach focuses on the positive aspects of your relationship and acknowledges your grandma's good intentions. It also sets clear boundaries and encourages her to consider your feelings.\n\nAnother approach you could take is to set a specific example of how you'd like her to handle situations like this in the future. For instance, you could say:\n\n\"Hey Grandma, when we're planning your next visit, can we agree that you won't bring anything unless I specifically ask you to? I'd really appreciate it if we could stick to that. This way, I know you're respecting my wishes and we can focus on spending quality time together.\"\n\nBy being specific and clear about your boundaries, you can help your grandma understand what you need and want from her.\n\nLastly, it's essential to recognize that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to their actions. If your grandma continues to disregard your wishes, it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself. You might need to re-evaluate the dynamic of your relationship and consider setting more significant boundaries or taking a step back if necessary.\n\nRemember, mutual respect is a two-way street. You deserve to be respected and understood, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs in the process."

I'm autistic, ADHD, and have recurring problems with depression and anxiety. Basically, I can't work around/with other people as my auditory processing disorder makes it hard to interact with people who I'm not completely comfortable with.\n\nMy mom suggested medical coding because a lot of the jobs are remote. And I've spent over $2000 on books and classes and am still paying a monthly amount for access to my classes which I haven't touched in like three months. My husband helped me pay for my books which are now out of date and not allowed for the exam, so I have to buy all new ones. The exam is hundreds of dollars too. And I can't do it. For the first 1/4 of the course, I did great. And then it got way more complicated and I just cannot wrap my head around it. I mean it literally makes my head hurt.\n\nI was failing all my quizzes before I just gave up a few months ago but everyone still thinks I'm working on it. My husband (30M) and I have been together for three years and want to start trying for a baby next month but he's hinging our whole future on my having a medical coding job and I am scared to tell him that I hate it and can't do it and don't want to finish it. It makes me miserable; I hate it so much. And I've tried desperately to find any other feasible ideas for long term work to soften the blow, but I've got nothing. I work less than ten hours a week doing paperwork for a real estate agency and that even stresses me out. I'm useless. I'm a failure and my husband is going to be so upset.\n\nWe've had some really intense issues with communication in the past. He's been in therapy and gotten on medication which has helped absolutely enormously, but I'd still say we're like 75% of the way to where we should be. He's been very kind and open to communicating better and I'm optimistic about that, but he can be a major overthinker and tends to do the worst-case-scenario thing. I feel that with some better budgeting, we'd be fine starting a family with the money coming in between us now, but he doesn't feel that way. I'm afraid he's going to push back us having a baby because of this and that's literally all I've ever wanted to be is a mom. It's the only thing in the world I've ever wanted and known I can do.\n\nThe stress of keeping this all to myself is eating me alive. I feel like I can't breathe from the weight of my thoughts and fears.

It's not uncommon for people to change their minds or realize it's not the right fit, especially when it comes to careers. You've already invested a significant amount of time and money, but it's better to be honest with yourself and others about your feelings.\n\nI understand your concerns about telling your husband. It's natural to be worried about his reaction, especially given your past communication challenges. However, it's essential to remember that honesty is usually the best policy in the long run. Withholding the truth can lead to more stress and resentment in the relationship.\n\nBefore you have this conversation with your husband, I suggest taking some time to prepare and gather your thoughts. You might want to consider writing down your concerns, feelings, and reasons why you don't want to continue with medical coding. This can help you articulate your thoughts and feel more confident when discussing it with him.\n\nWhen you do have the conversation, try to focus on your feelings and experiences rather than making accusations or blaming others. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming your husband for expecting you to succeed in a field that doesn't suit you. For example, you could say, \"I've been feeling really overwhelmed and unhappy with my medical coding classes, and I think it's best if I quit. I know you were counting on me to have a job in this field, but I don't think it's the right fit for me.\"\n\nIt's also crucial to have an open and honest discussion about your husband's expectations and concerns. Listen to his perspective and try to understand where he's coming from. You might need to work together to find a new plan or compromise that works for both of you.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not a failure, and it's okay to make changes. You're taking a brave step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your life, such as your desire to become a mother.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this.

It's built on mutual respect, trust, communication, and a willingness to grow together. By focusing on these aspects, you can create a strong foundation for a happy and fulfilling marriage."

    "base_reply": "The delicate dance of addressing a sensitive issue with your partner! It's great that you're aware of the importance of approaching this conversation with care.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's not about judging her, but rather about your shared financial well-being and the impact of her spending habits on your relationship. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Choose the right time and setting**: Find a private, calm, and comfortable setting where you both feel relaxed. Avoid bringing it up during stressful or emotional moments.\n2. **Start with empathy and understanding**: Begin by expressing your concern for her feelings and your desire to have an open and honest conversation. Let her know that you value your relationship and want to work together to find a solution.\n\nExample: \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our finances. I know we've been struggling lately, and I'm worried about our future together. I love you and value our relationship, and I want us to be on the same page when it comes to money. Can we talk about this?\"\n\n3. **Focus on the impact, not the person**: Instead of attacking her for her spending habits, explain how it affects your shared life and goals. Use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel and what you've observed.\n\nExample: \"I feel anxious when we're constantly living paycheck to paycheck. I've noticed that our expenses have been increasing, and I'm worried that we're not saving for our future together. Can we find a way to balance our spending and prioritize our financial goals?\"\n\n4. **Avoid blaming or criticizing language**: Phrases like \"You always\" or \"You never\" can come across as accusatory. Instead, focus on specific behaviors or actions that are causing concern.\n\nExample: \"I've noticed that we've been overspending on dining out lately. I understand that we like to enjoy ourselves, but I think it's affecting our ability to save for our goals. Can we find ways to reduce our dining expenses and allocate that money towards our savings?\"\n\n5. **Offer support and solutions**: Show your partner that you're willing to work together to find a solution. Suggest specific changes or compromises that you're willing to make to help manage your finances.\n\nExample: \"I'm willing to help you create a budget and track our expenses together. I think it would really help us stay on track. Can we also consider setting aside a certain amount each month for savings and entertainment?\"\n\n6. **Listen actively and be patient**: Your partner may feel defensive or upset, but try to remain calm and empathetic. Listen to their concerns and acknowledge their feelings.\n\nRemember, the goal is to have an open and honest conversation, not to \"win\" an argument. By approaching the conversation with empathy and a solution-oriented mindset, you can work together to find a more sustainable financial future."

    "sentence": "So my (m26) girlfriend (f25) and I have been together about 10 months. We found out she was 2 months pregnant with her ex’s child early on into dating (he completely ghosted her upon finding out about the pregnancy and wanted nothing to do with the child and hasn’t been around since; child is 3 months old). When she found out she told me it was completely okay and understandable if I wanted to stop seeing each other as this was very unexpected. I have cared for this girl for over 2 years (we were friends first) and I didn’t want to lose her. I wanted to be there for her and this child and be the father in every way (except biologically). We’ve had some issues in the relationship (honestly because I’ve done some pretty stupid things) that have led to disagreements. The last one we had was the day before her birthday (4 days before the baby was born).\n\nSince then my girlfriend has been distant. She hasn’t been affectionate at all, she doesn’t seem to like when I touch her, sometimes she sleeps in the living room and keeps the baby with her vs coming into the room, and she just honestly looks dead behind her eyes when I tell her I love her. I know she loves me but she just looks sad and I’m not sure how to approach this and fix it.\n\n\nEDIT: this is the stuff I’ve done “As much as I hate to admit it, I haven’t been the best partner. I’ve entertained women flirting with me, I purchased explicit content of somebody I know personally from a certain website, and I’ve hung out with an ex without telling her and the ex tried to make a move and put my girlfriend down. The last incident was a mess. I have another ex (let’s call her L) that I dated all through middle school and most of high school. We split senior year and we stayed best friends. My gf was okay with the friendship (she knows L and knows she  has zero feelings for me and I her). Basically I keep in contact with the L’s mom as well and she has always wanted us back together. I had (stupidly) told my L’s mom in late January that if I thought my ex still felt that way about me I’d try and get back with her. Well word got back to my girlfriend and she was really hurt.”\n\nAlso stop saying I cheated because my girlfriend has even said that I have not.  I did fucked up shit that crossed boundaries, yes but I didn’t cheat. When I entertained women I mean they flirted and I let them, when they asked about a number or taking it further, I told them I had a girlfriend. Buying the explicit content, I should’ve thought that through. She said it’s porn and doesn’t bother her but not to purchase from people I know. Hanging out with my one ex, we met up for a drink. She attempted something and put my girlfriend down, but I shut her down and left. She said this bothered her but all I did was meet for a drink thinking it might be possible to remain friends. She said she wasn’t a fan of it but I didn’t do anything with her and  I didn’t cheat. Same with the L situation. I did some stupid ass shit, but I asked my girlfriend if she felt I cheated at all and she has always said no but I need better boundaries\n\nTl;dr my (m26) girlfriend (f25) is distant after having baby and idk how to fix it",

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking responsibility for your actions and acknowledging that you've done some things that have caused hurt and discomfort for your girlfriend. It's clear that you care about her and want to make things right.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your girlfriend is going through a significant life change with the arrival of the baby, and it's natural for her to be feeling overwhelmed and emotional. The fact that she's been distant and withdrawn doesn't necessarily mean she's giving up on the relationship, but it's likely a sign that she needs some space and time to process her feelings.\n\nAs you navigate this situation, I want to suggest a few things you can do to try and reconnect with your girlfriend:\n\n1. **Give her space**: Respect her need for distance and don't take it personally. This doesn't mean you should avoid talking to her or ignoring her, but rather give her the space she needs to recharge and reflect on her feelings.\n2. **Communicate openly and honestly**: When you do talk to her, be open and honest about your feelings and actions. Acknowledge the hurt you've caused and apologize sincerely for any pain or discomfort you've caused. Make sure to listen actively to her perspective and validate her emotions.\n3. **Focus on rebuilding trust**: As you've acknowledged, you've done some things that have damaged the trust in your relationship. Focus on rebuilding that trust by being transparent, consistent, and reliable. Follow through on your commitments, and be patient and understanding when she needs time to process her emotions.\n4. **Support her as a partner and co-parent**: As you mentioned, you want to be there for her and the baby. Continue to be a supportive partner and co-parent. Help with childcare, errands, and other responsibilities. This will not only help her feel more supported but also give you opportunities to bond with the baby and strengthen your relationship.\n5. **Reflect on your actions and boundaries**: Take this time to reflect on your actions and boundaries. As you mentioned, you've done some things that have crossed boundaries, and it's essential to learn from those experiences. Set clear boundaries for yourself and communicate them to your girlfriend. This will help you avoid similar situations in the future and strengthen your relationship.\n\nRemember, relationships are a two-way street, and it may take time for your girlfriend to work through her emotions and feelings. Be patient, communicate openly, and focus on rebuilding trust and intimacy."

While I'm not a financial advisor, I'll provide you with some honest and legitimate options to consider.\n\nFirstly, let's address the elephant in the room - Fiverr.com. While it's a legitimate platform, it's not a reliable way to make a steady income. The pay is often low, and you'll need to work hard to build a reputation and attract clients.\n\nHere are some alternative options that might help you earn a decent income:\n\n1. Freelance writing or editing: If you have strong writing or editing skills, consider offering your services on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or ProBlogger. You can also reach out to local businesses, websites, or blogs directly to offer your services.\n2. Online surveys and gig economy jobs: Sign up with apps like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, or InboxDollars, which offer rewards for completing surveys, delivering food, or running errands. While the pay might not be high, it's a way to earn some extra cash.\n3. Sell unwanted items: Declutter your home and sell items you no longer need or use on platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. You can also hold a yard sale or garage sale.\n4. Pet-sitting or dog-walking: If you love animals, consider offering pet-sitting or dog-walking services in your neighborhood. You can advertise your services on social media or use pet-sitting platforms like Rover.\n5. Deliver food or packages: Sign up to be a delivery driver with companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Amazon Flex. You can also consider working as a package delivery driver for companies like Amazon.\n6. Sell handmade goods: If you have a talent for crafting or making things, consider selling your goods on platforms like Etsy or at local craft fairs.\n7. Tutoring or online teaching: If you have expertise in a particular subject, offer tutoring services online or in-person. You can use platforms like TutorMe, Chegg, or Varsity Tutors.\n8. Data entry or virtual assistance: Offer your services as a virtual assistant, providing administrative support to businesses or entrepreneurs. You can use platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to find clients.\n\nRemember, these options might not make you rich quickly, but they can help you earn some extra money to get back on your feet. Be cautious of any opportunities that seem too good to be true or require you to pay a fee to participate.\n\nRegarding your debt, it's essential to prioritize paying it off as soon as possible. Consider consolidating your debt into a single, lower-interest loan or credit card. You can also reach out to your credit card company to discuss possible payment plans or hardship programs.\n\nLastly, don't forget to take care of your mental and emotional well-being during this challenging time. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support, and prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in your financial journey!"

Here's a suggestion:\n\nWhy not plan a casual, low-key meeting with her father, perhaps over a meal or a walk? You could say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about something important. I've been thinking about proposing to your daughter, and I value your opinion and respect for her. I'd love to get your blessing and your thoughts on it.\" This approach shows that you're considerate of her family's cultural significance and that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation.\n\nAs for the proposal itself, considering your shared profession as dietitians, you could plan a romantic dinner at a nice restaurant, and have a special dessert or wine pairing that represents your love for each other (e.g., a custom-made dessert with a special message or a wine bottle with a custom label). You could also incorporate elements of your shared profession, such as a \"recipe for love\" or a \"balanced relationship\" theme.\n\nAnother idea is to plan a scenic hike or outdoor activity that you both enjoy, and propose at a beautiful spot with a stunning view. This could be a great way to make the moment feel more personal and meaningful.\n\nLastly, don't forget to make it personal and sincere. Speak from your heart, and express your true feelings to her.

Yes, it's not uncommon for our perception of someone's body odor to shift over time, especially in the context of a romantic relationship.\n\nWhen we're in the early stages of a relationship, our brains are flooded with dopamine and other feel-good hormones, which can make us more receptive to our partner's imperfections, including their body odor.

Our brains are wired to prioritize our emotional well-being, and when we're no longer invested in someone, our perception of them can shift to reflect that.\n\nIt's not about the actual change in his body odor; it's about your brain's re-evaluation of it in the context of your current emotional state.

    "sentence": "This will probably be long, sorry!\n\nI was raised and grew up in a very conservative very religious household and community. It was to the point where everything and everyone’s purpose was to serve our religion and our community. I was homeschooled all the way up until college, and then the college I attended was a small school run by members of the same group. To say I was sheltered is very much an understatement.\n\nI met my husband there (another devout believer like me), we “dated,” which mostly consisted of attending prayer services together, until we finished school, and then we immediately married. I became a schoolteacher, and his work required occasional travel, but we made a happy life together never really leaving the confines of our community.\n\nA little over a year ago that was all turned upside down. My husband was offered a very high-paying job in the suburbs of a fairly major city. It would require him to travel a bit more, but we’d be substantially better off. We talked about it and decided to do it, especially since there was also an opening at a school in the area where we were moving. \n\nSo we set it all up. He took the job, we bought a new house, and I was hired to teach at this new school. Once I started working there, I was hit with quite a bit of culture shock. All sorts of new ideas, people, and beliefs were coming at me quicker than I really had time to process. It was very overwhelming at first, especially since I’d rarely ever had to deal with someone even outside of our religion. \n\nSo to shorten this up a little and get to my point, eventually I started to come around to question some of the things I’d been taught and I’d believed all growing up. Specifically, I met a male colleague who was just very different. He was charming, confident, witty, intelligent,  and (honestly) attractive, and he believed none of what I did. We had amazing discussions and debates during our shared lunch together. I realized eventually that I wasn’t really sure how much of what I believed. I wasn’t sure if I’d ever really thought hard about it, and now that I was, I was questioning. I found myself talking about subjects I’d never talked about, laughing at jokes that would have horrified previous me, but I also found myself happier than I was, even though I had thought I was happy.\n\nAll of this was, of course, without my husband’s knowledge. He is, was, and always will be a true believer. Recently, it’s made me think less of him, both intellectually and physically. On top of that, I think I also have feelings for my coworker. \n\nTl;dr—To sum it all up, I’m not really sure if my husband and I have anything in common beyond our religion, and meeting someone new has opened my eyes to that and to perhaps my being a different person than I thought I was even, and I’m not sure what to do at all!",

The fact that you're questioning his intellectual and physical appeal suggests that there might be deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nAs for your feelings for your coworker, it's natural to develop strong connections with people who share similar interests and values. However, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with someone who doesn't share your religious beliefs. You might need to prioritize your own personal growth and exploration before making any decisions.\n\nHere's a suggestion: take some time to reflect on what you truly want and need in a relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your values, and what's important to you? It might be helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings to clarify your priorities.\n\nIn the meantime, consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns.

It's not easy to admit when you need help, so keep that in mind as you're going through this process.\n\nSince you're struggling to find a job, let's focus on the apartment hunt for now. I understand the income requirement can be a major hurdle. Here are a few strategies to consider:\n\n1. **Look for apartments that don't require 3x rent income**: Some landlords might be more flexible, especially if they're desperate to fill a vacancy. You can try searching online for apartments that have a \"no income requirement\" or \"income not required\" filter. You can also try contacting local property management companies or real estate agents to ask about their policies.\n2. **Consider a roommate**: While you mentioned you don't have anyone to split rent with, you might not need to. Look for apartments that allow you to bring a roommate later on, or even consider renting a room in a shared house. This way, you can start with a smaller space and adjust as needed.\n3. **Look into subsidized housing**: Depending on your location, there might be government programs or non-profit organizations that offer affordable housing options. These often have income requirements, but they might be more flexible than traditional rentals.\n4. **Negotiate with the landlord**: If you find an apartment you love, don't be afraid to negotiate. Explain your situation to the landlord and see if they're willing to work with you. They might be more open to a longer lease or a lower deposit to secure the apartment.\n5. **Keep saving and budgeting**: Meanwhile, focus on building your savings and budgeting your service job income. Try to save as much as possible each month, even if it's just $100-200. This will give you a cushion when you do land a job and can afford the apartment.\n\nAs for job hunting, I understand the frustration of not getting hired due to lack of experience. Here's a tip: focus on building a strong online presence. Create a professional LinkedIn profile, and make sure your resume is updated and tailored to the jobs you're applying for. You can also try networking with people in your industry on LinkedIn or at local events.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's normal to face setbacks, and it's okay to take your time to figure things out. Remember that every successful person has had to navigate similar challenges at some point in their lives.\n\nKeep pushing forward, and don't give up on your goal of moving out and starting your life.

    "human": "So you were broken up, you’ve only been back together 5 months and you’re already talking about getting married in FEBRUARY? And you’re not even sexually attracted to her? Do you seriously need Reddit to tell you how dumb of an idea this is?\n\nYou can talk to her about it, but I imagine telling her “hey, I’m not sexually attracted to you and I have to think of other women to get off” won’t come off great and would destroy her confidence. Honestly, you probably should’ve stayed separated. There is no magic fix for this. This on/off thing isn’t doing either of you or your child any favors.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, it takes a lot of courage to share this with someone. I'm here to offer you an honest and non-judgmental perspective.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's not uncommon for people to experience a decrease in sexual attraction over time. However, the fact that you're feeling repulsed and disconnected from your partner is a significant concern.\n\nBefore we dive into potential solutions, I want to emphasize that it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional and physical well-being. Ignoring your feelings or suppressing them can lead to resentment and potentially harm your overall relationship.\n\nConsidering your concerns and the fact that you're hesitant about spending the rest of your life with someone you dread being intimate with, I'd like to explore a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Intimacy is not just about sex**: While sex is an essential part of a romantic relationship, it's not the only aspect. You mentioned you and your partner get along great in other areas, which is a significant foundation. Maybe focus on nurturing those aspects and exploring other ways to connect emotionally and intellectually.\n2. **Communication is key**: Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings. Be specific about how you're feeling, and try to avoid blaming or criticizing her. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and emotions. This might help you both understand each other better and find ways to address the issue together.\n3. **Sexual compatibility is a deal-breaker for some, but not for everyone**: If, after having this conversation, you both decide that your lack of sexual connection is a significant issue, it may be worth considering whether this relationship is sustainable for you in the long term. It's essential to prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment.\n4. **Consider counseling**: A couples therapist can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your issues. A professional can also provide guidance on how to maintain intimacy and connection in other ways, even if sexual chemistry is lacking.\n5. **Reflect on your feelings and values**: Take some time to introspect and understand what you value in a romantic relationship. Is it the emotional connection, shared values, or something else? If your current relationship is missing a crucial aspect, it might be worth exploring whether it's worth continuing.\n\nRemember, relationships are complex, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional and physical well-being while considering the well-being of your partner and your relationship.\n\nI hope this helps you feel less alone and more equipped to navigate this challenging situation."

It's not an easy choice, and I'm here to help you weigh the pros and cons.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you have a strong desire to pursue your educational and personal goals, which is admirable. You've had a taste of the international education system and feel it suits you better, and you have a genuine interest in studying in Australia. It's crucial to prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment in this decision.\n\nRegarding your boyfriend, it's understandable that you feel torn. You've invested two years in the relationship, and it's natural to feel a deep emotional connection. However, it's also important to recognize that his willingness to break up if you go to Australia is a significant red flag. If he's not willing to work through the challenges of a long-distance relationship, it may indicate that he's not committed to making the relationship work.\n\nIt's also important to consider that his decision to break up might not be solely about the distance. It could be a reflection of his own insecurities or fears about your growing independence and the possibility of losing you. You deserve to be with someone who supports and encourages your growth, even if it means navigating challenges like long-distance relationships.\n\nIn terms of your parents, it's great that they're encouraging you to pursue your dreams. While it's understandable that you don't want to hurt your boyfriend, you should also prioritize your own well-being and happiness. It's okay to have difficult conversations with your boyfriend and express your feelings and concerns. You can't control how he reacts, but you can control how you approach the situation.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Share your thoughts on why you want to study in Australia and how you're feeling about the possibility of a long-distance relationship.\n2. Be clear about your own needs and expectations in the relationship. Let him know that you value his support and encouragement, but you also need to prioritize your own goals and aspirations.\n3. Consider whether your relationship is truly meant to be if he's not willing to work through the challenges of a long-distance relationship. Remember, relationships are about growth, communication, and mutual support.\n4. Weigh the pros and cons of staying in the relationship versus pursuing your goals. Consider whether staying in the relationship would lead to long-term happiness and fulfillment for you.\n\nRemember, this is your decision, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs. You deserve to be with someone who supports and encourages your growth, even if it means letting go of someone who's not willing to work through the challenges of a long-distance relationship."

    "human": "Flip a coin. After it lands, you may feel that you hoped for the other outcome, go with that. If you are still split, just go with the coins decision.",
    "base_reply": "The eternal struggle of indecision! I'm here to help you tackle it. Becoming more decisive requires a combination of self-awareness, prioritization, and strategic decision-making. Here are some tips to help you make decisions with confidence:\n\n1. **Identify your values and priorities**: When faced with a decision, ask yourself what's most important to you. What are your non-negotiables? What will align with your long-term goals and values? This will help you filter out options that don't align with your priorities.\n2. **Set a decision-making framework**: Establish a structured approach to decision-making. Ask yourself questions like:\n\t* What are the pros and cons of each option?\n\t* What are the potential outcomes for each choice?\n\t* What are the potential risks and consequences?\n\t* What are the key factors that will influence my decision?\n3. **Practice active listening**: When weighing the options, listen carefully to your inner voice and your intuition. Pay attention to your gut feeling about each choice. Sometimes, your instincts can be a powerful guide.\n4. **Limit your options**: When faced with too many choices, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Try to narrow down your options to the most promising ones. This will help you focus your energy and make a more informed decision.\n5. **Use the 80/20 rule**: In many cases, 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts. Identify the most critical factors that will have the greatest impact on your decision and focus on those.\n6. **Create a \"pros and cons\" list**: Write down the advantages and disadvantages of each option. This will help you visualize the trade-offs and make a more balanced decision.\n7. **Take a break and come back to it**: Sometimes, taking a step back and coming back to a decision later can help you approach it with a fresh perspective.\n8. **Practice decision-making in low-stakes situations**: The more you practice making decisions in low-stakes situations, the more comfortable you'll become with the process. This will help you build confidence and develop your decision-making skills.\n9. **Embrace the uncertainty**: Recognize that there's always some level of uncertainty in decision-making. Instead of trying to eliminate all risk, focus on making the best decision based on the information you have.\n10. **Learn from your mistakes**: When you do make a decision and it doesn't turn out as expected, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Reflect on what you could have done differently and apply those lessons to future decisions.\n\nRemember, becoming more decisive takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance when needed."

    "human": "Hey there, the best advice I ever received for social situations was from my psych prof.

What do you think?\"  Nothing too personal, and if they say something that resonates with you, acknowledge it, without turning the whole conversation to yourself - say just enough to encourage them to keep talking.  \n\nAlso, mirror them a bit, but not too obviously. If they put their hands in their pockets, you do the same.  It creates an unconscious connection. \n\nAs for being in the classroom, don't worry about saying the right thing every time.

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. Social anxiety can be overwhelming! It's great that you're acknowledging it and willing to work on it. Here's the thing: social awkwardness isn't something you can just \"fix\" overnight, but you can take small steps to build confidence and improve your social skills.\n\nFirst, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand that it's normal to feel nervous**: Everyone gets nervous in social situations, even the most confident people. It's okay to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.\n2. **Identify your triggers**: Reflect on what specifically makes you feel anxious. Is it talking to girls, being in a big group, or something else? Once you know what triggers your anxiety, you can work on strategies to cope with those situations.\n3. **Practice relaxation techniques**: When you feel anxious, your body tenses up. Practice deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization exercises to calm your nerves. You can find many guided relaxation exercises online.\n4. **Start small**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Begin with tiny steps, like striking up a conversation with a cashier, saying hi to a neighbor, or commenting on a post on social media. Celebrate your small wins!\n5. **Focus on others**: Instead of worrying about yourself, try to show genuine interest in others. Ask questions, listen actively, and find common ground. This can help take the spotlight off you and make you feel more comfortable.\n6. **Improve your communication skills**: Practice active listening, clarify your thoughts before speaking, and avoid interrupting. These skills will help you feel more confident in conversations.\n7. **Join a small group or club**: Surround yourself with like-minded people who share similar interests. This can help you build connections and feel more comfortable in social situations.\n8. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative self-talk and reframe your thoughts. Instead of \"I'm going to freeze up and look stupid,\" tell yourself \"I'm nervous, but I can handle this.\"\n9. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your social anxiety. They can offer valuable advice, support, and guidance.\n10. **Be patient**: Building confidence and improving social skills takes time. Don't expect to change overnight, but celebrate small victories and keep working towards your goals.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Focus on progress, not perfection.\n\nAs for your specific situations:\n\n* When your name is called in class, take a deep breath, stand up, and slowly walk to the front. You can even practice this in front of a mirror or with a friend.\n* When eating in front of others, try to focus on the food and the company. You can also practice eating in front of a friend or family member to build comfort.\n* For events, start small by attending gatherings with a friend or two. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually branch out to larger groups.\n\nKeep in mind that social anxiety is not something you'll \"get over\" completely, but with practice and patience, you can learn to manage it and improve your social skills."

It's natural to feel that way, especially since you've never asked her to change anything about herself. Let's break this down and explore what might be going on.\n\nFirstly, it's possible that your girlfriend is genuinely concerned about the impact your weed use is having on your relationship. She might be feeling like it's affecting the quality of your interactions, making it harder for her to connect with you when you're high. Her request might not be about controlling or manipulating you, but rather about finding a balance that works for both of you.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that her request is motivated by her own discomfort or insecurities. If she's had issues with your best friend in the past over weed, it's possible that she's projecting those feelings onto you. Additionally, her concern about your behavior when you're high might be a way of exerting control or influence over your habits.\n\nAs for your compromise of smoking only 2 days a week, it's understandable that you feel like she's trying to change you. But consider this: are you willing to listen to her concerns and work together to find a compromise that works for both of you? It's possible that she's willing to make some changes too, like setting aside dedicated time for you to smoke or finding ways to spend quality time together that don't involve you being high.\n\nRather than accusing her of manipulation, try to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and concerns. Ask her why she's bringing this up now, and what specific behaviors or issues she's experiencing when you're high. Be willing to listen to her perspective and work together to find a solution that respects your autonomy and her feelings.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and growth. It's okay to have differences and find middle ground. But it's also important to communicate openly and honestly to avoid resentment and misunderstandings."

This sets a positive foundation for your suggestion.\n2. **Focus on the idea, not the person**: Instead of saying \"you're doing this wrong,\" say \"I think we could try this approach\" or \"I've found this method to be more effective in similar situations.\" This way, you're focusing on the idea rather than attacking the person.\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you always do this,\" say \"I feel frustrated when I see this happening.\" This helps to own your emotions and thoughts, making it less likely to come across as accusatory.\n4. **Ask open-ended questions**: Encourage the person to think critically by asking open-ended questions like \"What do you think about this approach?\" or \"Have you considered trying this alternative?\" This helps them feel more invested in the solution.\n5. **Be specific and concrete**: Provide specific examples or data to support your suggestion. This makes it harder for the person to dismiss your idea and shows you've put thought into it.\n6. **Listen actively**: Make sure you're actively listening to their perspective and responding thoughtfully. This shows you value their input and are willing to work together.\n7. **Avoid being too prescriptive**: Instead of dictating what the person should do, offer suggestions and alternatives.

Acknowledge that they may have valid reasons for their approach and that you're coming from a place of good intentions.\n\nRegarding your girlfriend, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your intentions. Explain that you're coming from a place of wanting to help and improve, and that you're willing to work together to find solutions. Ask her how she feels when you suggest alternatives and what she needs from you to feel more comfortable and supported.\n\nRemember, it's a process to develop a new way of communicating, so be patient and kind to yourself as you work on it."

Losing a friend can be a significant blow, and it's normal to feel a sense of grief.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that forgetting someone is not the goal. It's okay to still remember and cherish the memories you shared with your friend, even if you're no longer in contact. What you're looking for is a way to cope with the pain of the loss and move forward.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to \"forget\" your friend, focus on processing your emotions and acknowledging the impact their absence has had on you. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or nostalgic – all of these emotions are valid. Allow yourself to feel them, but also set a boundary around how much time you spend dwelling on the past.\n\nOne technique that might help is to write a letter to your friend, but don't send it. Sometimes putting your thoughts and feelings down on paper can help you process and release them. You can also try talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your feelings.\n\nAnother idea is to create a new routine or hobby to distract yourself from the pain of the loss. This could be something as simple as taking a new class, joining a book club, or starting a new exercise routine. Focusing on something new can help shift your attention away from the loss.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to take time to grieve and heal. Don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over it\" by a certain time or according to a certain timeline. Your emotions are valid, and it's okay to take the time you need to work through them.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many people have lost friends and have gone on to heal and find new connections. You will too."

I’ve been close with half a dozen guys from high school and a couple of buddies from college.\nBut lately, the gang isn’t as close. Three guys got married, and two of them already have kids. We’re all around the same age (I’m 28), but it feels like everything’s changed and it’s worrying me.\nThen I realized I’m lucky in another way: I got a job in a health-care field and I enjoy how my work helps people. I have the chance to travel overseas for a special course that’ll take me to a higher level.\nThough I’d like to hang out with the guys, I now feel I’m on my right track, regarding the present and my future.\nBut how do I stay friends with people I care about, when I’m living a whole different lifestyle?",

    "base_reply": "It's great that you're recognizing your own growth and progress, and acknowledging the changes in your life. It's normal to feel a sense of disconnection when friends' priorities and lifestyles shift, but it doesn't mean you have to abandon those friendships entirely.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to accept that you can't control how others evolve, but you can control how you approach and maintain these friendships. Since you're feeling like you're on the right track, it's crucial to prioritize nurturing relationships that align with your current values and goals.\n\nHere's a suggestion: Instead of trying to force the old gang dynamic to continue as is, consider setting aside regular, low-key activities with the guys that don't require a significant time commitment. This could be a monthly game night, a casual hike, or a sporting event. This way, you can still maintain a connection and shared experience without feeling like you're sacrificing too much.\n\nAs for the married guys with kids, it's okay to acknowledge that their priorities have shifted. You can still be supportive and show interest in their lives, even if you don't have as much time to hang out. A phone call or text every now and then to catch up can go a long way.\n\nRegarding the guys from college, since you're about to embark on a new adventure with the overseas course, you might find that you have more in common with them than you think. They might be experiencing their own transitions and changes, and you can support each other through that.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. If you find that certain friendships are no longer serving you or aligning with your values, it's okay to re-evaluate those relationships. You deserve to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you in your current stage of life.\n\nRemember, friendships are like any other relationship – they require effort, communication, and flexibility. By being open-minded, empathetic, and willing to adapt, you can maintain meaningful connections with your friends while also pursuing your own path."

It's completely understandable that you're struggling, and I'm here to offer you some advice and support.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's normal to feel shocked, confused, and hurt when someone you love and trusted suddenly walks away. The fact that she didn't give you a clear reason or closure can be particularly painful.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people have experienced similar situations, and it's not a reflection of your worth or lovability. It's possible that she was struggling with her own issues, and you simply weren't a good fit for her at that time.\n\nRegarding getting your mind off her, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to process your emotions**: It's crucial to acknowledge and validate your feelings, even if they're painful. Give yourself permission to grieve the loss of the relationship and the future you had envisioned.\n2. **Practice self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and comfort, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time in nature. This can help distract you from negative thoughts and improve your mood.\n3. **Focus on the present**: Instead of dwelling on what went wrong or what could've been, try to focus on the present moment. What can you control and improve in your life right now? Set small, achievable goals for yourself, and work on building a sense of purpose.\n4. **Reach out to support networks**: Lean on your close friends and family for emotional support. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood.\n5. **Consider therapy**: If you're struggling with depression and anxiety, consider seeking professional help. A therapist can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to process your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n\nRegarding the lack of closure, it's true that not everything can be fixed or explained. However, you can try to find closure by:\n\n1. **Accepting the uncertainty**: Recognize that you may never get a clear explanation or closure from your ex. Instead, focus on what you can control – your own healing and growth.\n2. **Focusing on what you learned**: Reflect on the positive aspects of the relationship and what you learned about yourself and your values. Use these insights to move forward and grow as a person.\n3. **Practicing forgiveness**: Forgiveness is a process, and it may take time. Try to let go of resentment and anger, not for your ex's sake, but for your own. Holding onto negative emotions can weigh you down and prevent you from moving forward.\n\nRemember, recovery is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it.\n\nKeep in mind that it's normal to still think about your ex from time to time, but try not to dwell on it.

I had been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years when we split up due to her clingyness and need for constant attention, including taking literally all of my free time. We broke up, and I spent nearly 6 months or the 7 we were apart by myself, completely alone. I loved the freedom, but I missed her. So I eventually reunited my relationship with said girlfriend.\n\nWe had a son our first year into our relationship, so I can understand her wanting to spend a lot of family time together, but I literally work, and spend time with her watching tv or helping with dinner or some other everyday thing. I have zero time to myself. We've been back together for almost a year now and her clingyness has renewed itself in full force. I can't even take a shower by myself without her having to constantly be around me or keep tabs on me.\n\nI just want a few hours to myself maybe outside on the porch, or in the shed, or even a night out fishing with some buddies, but all of these tasks as of now must include her. I feel like we suffer a lot of relationship problems due to the stress that is caused by us being around each other all the time.

    "base_reply": "I can sense your frustration and longing for some alone time. It's essential to address this issue before it leads to further resentment and damage to your relationship. Here's a suggested approach to help you get some personal space without being perceived as unloving:\n\n1. **Communicate your feelings**: Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Avoid blaming or accusing language, and instead, focus on your own emotions and needs. Use \"I\" statements to express yourself, such as: \"I feel overwhelmed and stressed when we're together 24/7. I need some time to recharge and reflect on my own. Can we find ways to give me some space?\"\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries and expectations for your alone time. You can say something like: \"I understand we're a family and we spend a lot of time together, but I need some dedicated time for myself. Can we agree on specific times when I can have some alone time, like an hour in the morning or an evening, or a day off on the weekends?\"\n3. **Find alternative solutions**: Instead of insisting on absolute alone time, look for compromises that still allow you to have some space. For example, you could suggest doing a hobby or activity that you enjoy, but do it with her present, like watching a movie or playing a game together. This way, you're still spending time together, but you're also doing something you enjoy.\n4. **Schedule it in**: Treat your alone time as a non-negotiable part of your daily routine. Put it in your calendar, just as you would any other important appointment. This will help you prioritize your own needs and ensure that you're not sacrificing your alone time for other activities.\n5. **Be patient and consistent**: It may take some time for your girlfriend to adjust to the new dynamic, so be patient and consistent in your communication and boundary-setting. Avoid giving in to her demands for constant attention, as this will only reinforce the behavior.\n6. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take this opportunity to assess your priorities and values. Are you willing to compromise on your alone time for the sake of the relationship? Are there other ways you can nurture your connection with your girlfriend that don't involve constant togetherness? Reflecting on these questions can help you gain clarity and perspective.\n7. **Seek support**: Consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor to work through these issues. A professional can provide you both with guidance on effective communication, conflict resolution, and boundary-setting.\n\nRemember, it's essential to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Your girlfriend may not be aware of the impact her behavior is having on you, and she may be willing to work with you to find a solution. By communicating your needs and setting clear boundaries, you can maintain a healthy relationship while also prioritizing your own well-being."

I really can't make the payments, and have been in forbearance mode for a couple years.  I graduated in 2010, and was supposed to start repaying in 2011.  I made a couple payments, but then have been on and off of unemployment for the past couple of years.",
    "human": "You can only be in forbearance a maximum of 36 months total, so it sounds like you're near exhausting this as an option. Income Based Repayment will definitely lower your monthly payments, but you need to be aware that it extends the life of the loan to 25 years AND you have to provide verification of income annually. That means as your income changes, your payments will change up or down depending on what you're earning that year. Because it's a longer loan, you will pay a butt-load more in interest. The good-ish news is any amount left on your loan at the end of 25 years is forgiven. The bad-ish news is the forgiven amount is taxable income, so be as prepared as possible.\n\nIBR is fab because your payments will never be more than 15% of your discretionary income. \n\nTo qualify for IBR, you will need to prove partial financial hardship. As you've been on and off unemployment, you should be good with just documentation of that. But if you're near exhausting your unemployment benefits, you can register with a temp agency.\n\nOne other thing - if you are married and your spouse has student loan debt too, BOTH spouse's loans and both spouse's incomes are considered in calculating what your new monthly payment amount will be under IBR.  \n\nYou can apply for IBR through your servicer or studentloans.gov. The feds are pushing the IBR plan pretty hard lately because it gives more people a chance to pay back something on their loans and avoid default. \n\nLoan consolidation is another option, but check with your servicer first to see if the savings on monthly payments is affordable for you.\n\n(Disclosure - I am a default prevention specialist at a for-profit school)",
    "base_reply": "The student loan repayment struggle is real! I'm here to help you navigate your options and provide some realistic advice.\n\nFirst, kudos to you for acknowledging the situation and seeking help. It's essential to address the issue before it gets out of hand.\n\nSince you've been in forbearance for a couple of years, it's crucial to explore your options and find a sustainable repayment plan. Here are a few strategies to consider:\n\n1. Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans: These plans can lower your monthly payments based on your income and family size. You might be eligible for IDR plans like Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), or Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE). You can apply for IDR plans through your loan servicer or the Federal Student Aid website.\n2. Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan: This plan also bases your payments on your income, but it's a bit more complex. ICR might be a good option if you're self-employed or have variable income.\n3. Forgiveness programs: You might be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or Teacher Loan Forgiveness if you work in a qualifying public service or education-related field. Research these programs and see if you qualify.\n4. Consolidation: If you have multiple loans with high interest rates, consolidation might help simplify your payments and potentially lower your interest rate. However, be cautious, as consolidation can also extend your repayment period and increase the total amount you pay over time.\n5. Refinancing: Private student loan refinancing can be an option if you have good credit and a stable income. However, be aware that refinancing federal loans into private loans can strip you of federal benefits like IDR plans and forgiveness programs.\n\nTo minimize your interest and avoid getting \"completely screwed\" by Fed Loan Servicing, I recommend the following:\n\n* Contact your loan servicer: Reach out to Fed Loan Servicing and explain your situation. They might be willing to work with you to temporarily suspend or reduce your payments.\n* Review your loan documents: Ensure you understand your loan terms, including the interest rate, repayment period, and any fees associated with your loans.\n* Prioritize your loans: If you have multiple loans, prioritize the ones with the highest interest rates or the smallest balances to tackle first.\n* Consider a temporary hardship deferment: If you're still struggling to make payments, a temporary deferment might be an option. This can pause your payments for a limited time, but keep in mind that interest will continue to accrue.\n\nAs for your specific situation, with $10,000 left to pay, you might want to explore IDR plans or ICR to lower your monthly payments. Since you've been in forbearance for a couple of years, it's essential to get back on track and make regular payments to avoid further damage to your credit score.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to be patient, persistent, and proactive in managing your student loans. Don't hesitate to reach out to your loan servicer or a financial advisor for personalized guidance.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm not a financial expert, and this advice is based on general information. It's essential to consult with a financial professional or your loan servicer to get tailored advice for your specific situation."

He was prior service military, so he doesn't really have a filter when it comes to saying stuff and he seems to be very up close and personal when he talks to people. But very likeable guy, but my biggest issue with him was that I thought he wanted to date me and that was why he talked to me so much.\n\nWell, I was talking to one of of my coworkers at lunch.

And then when I got to the weekend, I realized Jason did not ONCE try to talk to me. Usually he would ask me how my day was, but he wasn't anymore.\n\nI mean yeah I felt like he could be a creep at times, but I just wish he would tone it down, I didn't want to stop talking to him completely.\n\nSo the next week I try to say Hi to him because I felt bad for saying that about him to his face. And I can't find him anywhere. But I talk to all the other shipping gremlins. And they're all saying how Jason has been reserved for the past two weeks. He doesn't tell jokes anymore, usually he would tell 'Would you rathers' to everyone. But he hadn't done that in two weeks. All he did was focus on work, go to the gym and go home.\n\nAnother week goes by, and I noticed whenever I would walk to say hi to my friends from Shipping, Jason would get a really uncomfortable look on his face before he would walk away.\n\nAgain, another week goes by and hes still not really talking to anyone.

But now hes just giving me too much space.\n\nI just felt like he could go over the top with socializing and just wish he could tone it down.

On one hand, you didn't want Jason to be a creep and make you uncomfortable, and you felt like he was crossing a boundary.

It's possible that Jason took it personally and is now feeling hurt and embarrassed.\n\nIt's also possible that Jason's over-the-top personality was just a defense mechanism, and his reserved behavior now is a way of protecting himself from getting hurt again. People who have experienced trauma, like Jason did in the military, can sometimes struggle with boundaries and social interactions.\n\nGiven your busy schedule, it might be challenging to apologize in person. However, you could try sending him a message or an email expressing your regret for what you said and acknowledging that you didn't mean to hurt his feelings. You could also explain that you value your working relationship and would like to find a way to move forward in a positive way.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you can't control how others react to your words, but you can control how you respond to the situation. By apologizing and showing empathy, you can take the first step towards healing and rebuilding your relationship with Jason.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to reflect on what you meant by \"toning it down\" and whether you're expecting Jason to change his personality or behavior to suit your comfort level. It's important to respect people's differences and boundaries, and it might be more productive to focus on finding ways to communicate effectively and respectfully, rather than trying to change someone else's behavior.\n\nRemember that relationships are about give-and-take, and it's okay to have different personalities and boundaries.

Are they influenced by upbringing, social media, or past experiences? Acknowledge your biases and try to separate fact from assumption.\n2. **Seek diverse perspectives**: Expose yourself to different viewpoints, especially those that contradict your current beliefs. Read books, articles, and engage in conversations with people who have opposing opinions. This will help you understand the other side's perspective and potentially challenge your own.\n3. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with others, focus on understanding their perspective rather than preparing a counterargument. Repeat back what you've understood to ensure you're on the same page. This helps you internalize the opposing view and build empathy.\n4. **Challenge your emotions**: When you feel strongly about a topic, take a step back and ask yourself why. Is it based on logic or emotional attachment? Recognize that emotions can be a powerful motivator, but they shouldn't dictate your beliefs.\n5. **Consider the long-term consequences**: Think about the potential outcomes of your current beliefs. Are they aligned with your values and goals? Are they causing harm to yourself or others? Weigh the pros and cons, and be willing to adapt if necessary.\n6. **Practice self-reflection and self-compassion**: Acknowledge that it's okay to change your mind. It's a natural part of growth and learning. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend who's exploring new ideas.\n7. **Seek out new experiences**: Sometimes, changing your views requires new experiences or exposure to different environments. Be open to trying new things, even if they make you uncomfortable.\n8. **Cultivate critical thinking**: Develop a growth mindset and be willing to question your own beliefs. Encourage yourself to think critically about information and consider alternative explanations.\n9. **Surround yourself with people who challenge you**: Spend time with individuals who have different perspectives and are open to discussion. This can help you refine your thoughts and challenge your assumptions.\n10. **Be patient and persistent**: Changing your views and opinions takes time. Don't expect immediate results. Be patient, and remember that growth is a process.\n\nRemember, updating your opinions is not about being right or wrong; it's about being open to learning and growth.

However, this can vary greatly depending on the location, number of guests, and level of formality.\n* For destination weddings, luxury weddings, or high-end events, costs can easily exceed $200-$500 per guest.\n* If your family member is planning an intimate, low-key ceremony, the cost might be lower, around $50-$100 per guest.\n\nWhen considering whether $175 is too much, ask yourself:\n\n1. Is the wedding a destination event or a local celebration?\n2. Is the invitation cost including other perks, such as a reception, food, and drinks?\n3. Are there any other costs associated with attending the wedding, like travel or accommodations?\n4. How important is this event to you, and are you comfortable with the financial commitment?\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider having an open and honest conversation with your family member about your concerns. They might be willing to adjust the invitation cost or offer alternative options for guests who can't afford the full amount.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your own financial well-being and make decisions that align with your values and budget."

    "sentence": "Hi all,\n\nIn the UK here. Bit of background first, one of my best friends (17F) has been seeing this guy (20M) for just over a month now. She seems to like him, though sometimes mentions things he's done that have upset her. Thought to include this as they're not actually together at the moment, just seeing each other so to speak. \n\nYesterday my friend told me, deadly serious, that she's thought about wanting a kid for a while and wants to try for one with this guy she's not dating and has only known for a month. Apparantley she's asked the guy and he's decided to go for it, and has even offered to leave his job to move away with her (she's planning on moving to a foreign country when she turns 18 and has made him aware of this).\n\nI don't know what to think about the whole thing. I'm convinced she's not thought about it properly, hence why she wants to do it with a guy she's known for a month. If it was me being asked this by a girl after talking to her for such a short time I would have run the other way, but its just the thing of he's so happy to oblige. \n\nAny thoughts, advice on what to say to her, all welcome.\n\nTL,DR: Friend wants to have a baby with a guy she's been seeing for a month, advice please?Just want to thank everyone for the info and suggestions, not gonna be overly critical of her because as people say it's her life to ruin at the end of the day, but also want to try and make her see sense. I'll pass what I can along, especially the \"lemon clot essay\" suggestion (Jesus christ...), and do what I can.",
    "human": "She wants to become an unemployed teen mum with a guy she barely knows who has already agreed to a kid and to and move aboard with zero planning or jobs or support between them. God I hope my daughter has more sense when she's 17.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a lot to take in! I can understand why you're concerned. It's not every day someone wants to bring a new life into the world with someone they've known for just a month.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're thinking carefully about this and wanting to support your friend. It's not about being critical, but about being a good friend and wanting the best for her.\n\nWhen you talk to your friend, I'd suggest having an open and non-judgmental conversation. Start by expressing your concern and let her know you're coming from a place of love and care. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm really surprised to hear that you're considering having a baby with someone you've known for only a month. I want to make sure you're thinking about this carefully and considering all the implications. Can you tell me more about what's making you want to take this step so quickly?\"\n\nListen to her response and try to understand her perspective. It's possible she's feeling a sense of excitement, love, or a desire for stability, but it's essential to explore these feelings and concerns together.\n\nYou could also share your own thoughts and concerns in a non-accusatory way. For example:\n\n\"I understand why you might feel this way, but I have to admit, I'm a bit worried about the timing. Have you thought about what this might mean for your future, and what kind of support system you'll have? Have you considered the potential impact on your education, career, and personal goals?\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that it's her decision, and you're not trying to dictate what she should do. You could say:\n\n\"I want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what you decide. However, I do want to make sure you're making an informed decision and considering all the factors involved. If you're still unsure, maybe we can explore some resources or talk to a trusted adult together?\"\n\nRemember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try not to be too pushy or critical. It's possible your friend will appreciate your concerns and take them into consideration.\n\nThe \"lemon clot essay\" suggestion is a great one, by the way! It's a humorous way to highlight the potential risks and uncertainties involved in having a child with someone you've known for a short time.\n\nLastly, be prepared to accept that your friend might not change her mind, and that's okay. As you said, it's her life to live, and you can still be a supportive friend even if you don't agree with her decision."

We were even talking about what music we listened to when we were teenagers and how we both tried to be cool, and he said that he never cared what other people listened to, if it made them happy that's what mattered. But from past times with him that thinking doesn't apply to me, since apparently any and all kpop is the exception to the rule. I've been struggling with my mental health so much recently, and music's been the one thing I can rely on to make me feel any joy, but it feels like he's managed to taint that by mocking me.\n\nI've also started trying to learn some Korean so I can understand lyrics, and it's just a cool skill to have in my opinion. To help with picking up new vocabulary I tend to have a Google translate page open on my phone so I can quickly pick up new words I hear. He saw this and immediately started mocking people who learn Korean, going through the usual Koreaboo/kpop stan stereotypes, not even considering that I might be learning. I even ended up hiding any evidence just in case he saw when he came over so he wouldn't find out. I'm just not going to ever tell him at this point.\n\nI've always tried so hard to engage with his interests, even if I'd never actually seek out anything about them otherwise, because I know from past experiences how shitty it feels to have people just not care. I don't know how to stop caring so much about this, but it really gets to me and makes me feel really uncared for. \n\nTL,DR: I feel I have to hide my interests from my partner so he doesn't mock me\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for all your responses to this, I really wasn't expecting this many people to see it, so while I can't reply to everyone (sorry!) I am reading every single one. I'm not going to lie and say I'm going to immediately change everything and start standing up for myself because I know what I'm like, but I will definitely be talking more about this with my therapist and hopefully make some progress towards loving myself.\n\nThank you all again for being so supportive and insightful, I've really been needing it 💜",

    "base_reply": "I'm so glad you're getting support and feedback from this community! It takes a lot of courage to share your concerns and feelings.\n\nFirstly, it's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt and frustrated. Being mocked or belittled for something you're passionate about can be incredibly damaging to one's self-esteem and sense of identity.\n\nIt's great that you've been trying to engage with your partner's interests, despite not necessarily sharing them yourself. However, it's equally important to recognize that your own interests and passions deserve respect and validation. It's not about competing or trying to \"win\" someone over, but about being authentic and true to yourself.\n\nI think it's time to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how their behavior is affecting you. It's not about blaming or attacking them, but about expressing your feelings and needs. You can say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed that when I share my interests with you, you tend to mock me. It makes me feel really hurt and unworthy. I understand that we have different tastes, but I wish we could find a way to appreciate and respect each other's passions, even if they're not the same. Can we work on finding a more positive and supportive dynamic around this?\"\n\nIt's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and self-care. You mentioned struggling with mental health, and it's essential to find ways to nourish and protect your mental health. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment is crucial, and it's okay to prioritize those over trying to fit in or impress your partner.\n\nLastly, remember that you don't have to hide your interests or passions to make your partner happy. You can still share them with them in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you. It might mean finding other friends or communities who share your interests, or exploring ways to express your passions in a way that doesn't involve direct interaction with your partner.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be respected, validated, and loved for who you are, including your interests and passions. Keep being true to yourself, and don't give up on finding a more supportive and loving relationship."

Cold-texting can feel like a huge hurdle, but don't worry, I'm here to help you overcome it!\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that cold-texting shouldn't be about being aggressive or pushy. It's about being genuine, respectful, and thoughtful in your approach. Here's a simple formula to get you started:\n\n1. **Find common ground**: Look for something you both have in common, whether it's a shared interest, a hobby, or a favorite TV show/movie/book. This will give you a conversation starter and a connection to build upon.\n2. **Keep it light and casual**: Avoid being too formal or serious. Keep your initial message light, friendly, and casual. You're not trying to interview them or get into deep conversations just yet.\n3. **Ask an open-ended question**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves. This will help keep the conversation flowing and give you more to talk about.\n4. **Keep it short and sweet**: Keep your initial message concise and to the point. Aim for a few sentences at most. You don't want to overwhelm the other person with too much information.\n\nHere's an example of a cold-text that follows these guidelines:\n\n\"Hey [Name], I saw your post about [shared interest] and thought it was really cool! I've been into [related topic] lately too. What do you like about [shared interest]?\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to land a friendship right off the bat. Be patient, and don't be discouraged if the other person doesn't respond immediately. It's okay if it takes a few tries to get a conversation going.\n\nLastly, be authentic and respectful in your approach. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it can be a major turn-off.\n\nSo, take a deep breath, be yourself, and give it a try! Good luck, and I hope you make some amazing online connections!"

For instance, I had a sudden urge to start dancing more, learning dance, opening a dance account etc. but then I was upset due to a personal issue for a few weeks and just kinda left it there.

It's great that you're aware of this pattern and wanting to improve.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to have ups and downs, and it's not a reflection of your ability to achieve your goals. It's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle.\n\nTo overcome this, I'd recommend breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks. This will help you build momentum and make progress, even when faced with distractions. For instance, instead of saying \"I want to start dancing more,\" try setting a specific goal like \"I'll practice dancing for 20 minutes, 3 times a week, for the next month.\" Make it concrete and achievable.\n\nAnother strategy is to identify your why behind each goal. What drives you to want to learn dance, open a dance account, or achieve any other goal? Is it to feel more confident, to challenge yourself, or to have fun? When you connect with your why, you'll be more motivated to stay on track, even when faced with setbacks.\n\nIt's also crucial to develop strategies for dealing with distractions. This might mean setting aside dedicated time for your goals, finding accountability with a friend or mentor, or using tools like apps or planners to stay organized.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself when you do encounter setbacks. It's okay to take a break or adjust your approach when needed. Remember that progress is not always linear, and it's normal to experience ups and downs.\n\nRemember, the key is to focus on making progress, not perfection.

    "sentence": "Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for almost 2 years now.\n\nHe has a female friend who he got close to a few months before we got close. As our relationship has progressed, I’m getting more and more uncomfortable with their friendship. Just to clarify, they are only friends (at least from my boyfriend’s perspective). I feel sometimes he almost forgets about me when she is around and how close they are physically also makes me uncomfortable. \n\nSome examples include:\n-them almost (we debate whether or not it actually happened) grinding at a club and stopping when I caught sight of them. She stepped away when she saw me. He apologised and we dropped it. \n-They’re super cuddly and huggy - for example it’s not uncommon to see his arm around her if they’re sitting together. In contrast, physical touch is my love language and to me, he used to say that he struggles with physical affection. I’ll admit that it stung to see him do with her what I would wanted. \n-He recently was wrapping a scarf around her neck. He was doing it for her which I found rather intimate. \n-She had her head rested on his shoulder when we were out bowling. \n-Walking in a group, they tend to gravitate towards each other even when I don’t have other people to talk to. Situations like this make me feel kind of forgotten by my BF. \n\nWe recently had an argument where I felt he prioritised her over me. She was being disrespectful (which he agreed with but said he didn’t have an issue with it. He even went out of his way to tell her he wasn’t mad at her but other friends were). He wanted me to leave his place because he had some work to get done. She asked for a favour (that would have taken her only 10 minutes to do herself) and he agreed very easily despite me and friends advising him not to enable certain behaviours of hers. He postponed his work to run her errand for her. She was disrespectful to me and his other friends and hadn’t apologised yet even. I feel he disregarded my feelings and went out of his way to do something for her which she didn’t deserve at that point and which he didn’t want to do for me. \n\nInitially I wasn’t too bothered by their behaviour but it’s kind upsetting me after seeing him wrapping a scarf around her. It feels so intimate and I don’t like he shares this physical intimacy with someone else. I didn’t want to project my feelings onto their friendship but I’m feeling too uncomfortable to just suppress it. I feel their physical intimacy (when he supposedly had to learn how to be physically affectionate with me) feels disrespectful to our relationship. I don’t know if this is just jealousy or this level of intimacy is too much between friends. He’s just always with her and there’s so much touching. \n\nHow would you feel if this was your partner? Is this something I just have to deal with? Am I being unreasonable? If I do talk to him, what kind of boundaries do I even have the right to establish in his friendships? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend is very physically intimate with female friend which makes me uncomfortable. He recently disregarded my feelings about her to run an errand for her when he was advised not to even by other friends. This made me feel second to his friendship. Is it just me being unreasonable or do I get to have a say in how he can act with friends?\n\nEdit: Does it change things if most of the time they spend together is in group settings with me included as well? It’s not to say he’s only affectionate with her. He’s undoubtedly more physically intimate with than with her. But I feel certain things should only be for your partner. He’s otherwise a great boyfriend very considerate and open to listening but I feel some things you shouldn’t have to tell your partner not to do and this feels like one of them.

It's possible that he may not intend to make you feel uncomfortable or second to his friendship, but his behavior is still causing you distress.\n\nRegarding the recent incident where he prioritized his friend over you, it's understandable that you felt disregarded and disrespected. It's essential to communicate your feelings to him and establish boundaries in his friendships. You have every right to express your concerns and set boundaries around how you feel comfortable being treated in your relationship.\n\nSome potential boundaries you could discuss with your boyfriend include:\n\n1.

It makes me feel like you're prioritizing your friendship over our relationship. Can we find ways to be more mindful of my feelings in these situations?\"\n\nRemember that relationships involve compromise and understanding. It's possible that your boyfriend may not be aware of the impact his actions are having, and he may be willing to work with you to find a solution that makes you both feel comfortable.\n\nLastly, it's essential to remember that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. If your boyfriend is unwilling to work with you to address your concerns, it may be a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship."

I feel unappreciated. How do I handle this?\n\nMy (41 NB) cat died earlier in the spring at the age of 13 after his kidney failed. He was my cat from before I met my partner (29 M) but quickly won my partner over because he was really one the sweetest, gentlest cats I have ever had. The problem was, in his last year of life, vet bills really racked up, into the thousands, largely pocketed by me because I was really unwilling to part from him until I was sure it was his time, and it was pretty clear when it was time to let him go.\n\nMy partner initially didn't want to adopt a new cat right away because we still have an elderly dog we nearly lost this year as well, he's going back to school and so it has been a financial burden keeping him alive, and I was fine with that because I was still grieving my cat anyway. Late this spring, though, he started really missing having a cat around, so he and I went to a local rescue and fell in love with a little tabby-calico mix (1 1/2 F) who came from a hoarding situation.\n\nOverall, she's been a great cat, but the one thing I've struggled with over the month we've had her is that she poops in the bathtub and that it isn't solid. This combination led me to wonder if it is medical since I had a cat when I was a kid who did this when she had a UTI.\n\nMy partner thought I was overreacting and didn't want me to take her to the vet, but I insisted after she pooped in the middle of the dining room floor.\n\nAt the vet, we found out she has no parasites, but he wants us to try a combination of behavioral changes (such as adding an additional litter box) and a prescription cat food to see if it will clear up the consistency of the poop.\n\nWhen I told my partner, he was frustrated and told me that I'm making a deal over something that's minor. The thing is, with him working third shift and going to school, cleaning the house usually falls to me, which is something I don't mind since he does a lot of cooking. But I'm feeling really resentful that he sees this as no big deal since I'm usually the one who cleans up poop in the bathtub at least once a day.\n\nHe told me that he would agree to clean up the poop, which is something he can't seriously commit to because I work from home and would have to be in a home with cat poop in the open and even shower in it if I were to just leave it for him all the time. He got frustrated and told me I'm paying for the prescription food if I think it's so necessary.\n\nI'm feeling very upset right now because I really don't think it's normal for a cat to poop this much outside the litterbox but I feel very unsupported in trying to get her to stop, and I feel this is part of a larger issue about usually being the one who doesn't minimalize when something is wrong with the animals.\n\nHow can I approach this that both acknowledges his anxiety about finances while also pushing that a cat acting this way is not normal medically or behaviorally? I don't want to potentially spend 15 years with a cat that poops everywhere, especially if it can be easily corrected.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not thinking of getting rid of the cat. That's not on the table because it's not her fault. But I also don't think simply letting her poop everywhere is an acceptable solution.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure how clear I made it because I'm a little upset right now, but I think my frustration comes around his minimization of the cat's issue and his ultimatum that I would need to pay for it all.

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and frustrations. It's understandable that you feel unappreciated and unsupported in your efforts to address the cat's behavior. Here's a suggested approach to address the issue:\n\n1. Acknowledge his concerns: Start the conversation by acknowledging your partner's concerns about the financial burden. Let him know that you understand that unexpected expenses can be stressful, but you also want to address the cat's behavior and ensure her well-being.\n2. Explain the importance of addressing the issue: Explain to your partner that the cat's behavior is not normal and that it's essential to address it to prevent further damage to your home and to ensure the cat's health. You can say something like, \"I understand that it might seem like a minor issue, but for me, it's about ensuring our cat's health and well-being. I'm worried that if we don't address this, it could lead to more significant problems down the line.\"\n3. Offer alternatives: Instead of insisting that your partner pay for the prescription food, offer alternatives that could help reduce the financial burden. For example, you could suggest splitting the cost of the food or finding a more affordable option. You can say, \"I understand that the prescription food is a significant expense. Would it be possible for us to split the cost or look for a more affordable option?\"\n4. Emphasize the benefits of addressing the issue: Highlight the benefits of addressing the cat's behavior, such as reduced stress and anxiety for both of you, a cleaner home, and a healthier cat. You can say, \"By addressing this issue, we can reduce our stress levels, keep our home clean, and ensure our cat's health. I think it's worth investing in her well-being and our own peace of mind.\"\n5. Set clear expectations: Make it clear that you're not asking your partner to take on the entire responsibility of cleaning up after the cat, but rather to share the responsibility and work together to find a solution. You can say, \"I'm not asking you to take on all the cleaning responsibilities, but I do need your help in addressing this issue. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.\"\n\nRemember to approach the conversation calmly and respectfully, avoiding blame or accusation. By acknowledging your partner's concerns and offering alternatives, you can work together to find a solution that addresses both of your needs.\n\nAs for the pattern of your partner panicking over unexpected expenses and picking anxious fights, it may be helpful to have a separate conversation about this issue. You can express your concerns and feelings, and work together to find ways to manage financial stress and anxiety in a more constructive way."

Say it kindly and gently, but *say* it.  For all you know, she's doing because she thinks *you* think it's cute, and if you tell her that you don't, she'll stop.\n\nYou've been together for three years.

Then it's *her* choice whether to stop or not, based on her evaluation of how important your feelings are to her.",
    "base_reply": "The eternal conundrum of wanting to be honest while also being mindful of someone's feelings!\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for acknowledging that you don't want to hurt her feelings and value her comfort and safety around you. That's a great foundation for a healthy conversation.\n\nIt's understandable that what was initially cute has become annoying over time. It's possible that you've grown accustomed to being around her in a certain way, and this quirk has become a source of frustration.\n\nBefore you approach the conversation, take a moment to reflect on why you're feeling annoyed. Is it really the baby talk that's the issue, or is it something deeper? Are you feeling disrespected or undervalued? Clarifying your own emotions will help you approach the conversation with more empathy and understanding.\n\nWhen you do talk to her, try to frame the conversation as a genuine concern rather than a criticism. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I love spending time with you and feeling close to you. Lately, when we're alone, I've noticed that you sometimes talk in a way that's a bit more childlike. While I understand it's a way for you to feel comfortable and safe around me, it's starting to get on my nerves. I want to make sure we can communicate effectively and openly, and I worry that this might be causing misunderstandings or frustration for me. Can we find a way to balance your comfort with my needs for clear communication?\"\n\nBy acknowledging her feelings and expressing your own concerns, you're more likely to have a constructive conversation that works for both of you. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and express your needs in a relationship – it's a sign of emotional maturity and respect for each other."

Is there anything I can do?\nI’m 16 years old and I live with my Mom, her ex, and my sister.\n\n2 1/2 - 3 months ago, my mom stopped going grocery shopping, and only on some days would her ex go out and buy ingredients to cook with. Meaning that I go most days with no food at all, with my only form of sustenance being my school lunches. On weekends, I’m shit out of luck. Originally, I thought it has to do with a bad financial situation, until she told me outright that she was simply too lazy.\n\nI tell her that I’m hungry, and she replies to me saying “You’re always hungry.” I’m rapidly losing weight. I’m 5’10-5’11 and I used to be 170 lbs, I’m down to 150 now. I’ve never felt more weak in my entire life, and recently, I’ve started feeling dizzy and lightheaded, some times even short of breath.

It's not your fault that she's not meeting your basic needs, and it's not because you're \"always hungry\" as she says. It's her responsibility to provide for you and your sister.\n\nSince you're 16, you're old enough to take some initiative to take care of yourself. Here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. Talk to your mom again, but this time, be more specific about your concerns. Tell her how her behavior is affecting you physically and emotionally. Share your weight loss, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Be clear and assertive, but avoid blaming or attacking her.\n2. If she still refuses to listen, consider talking to your sister. She might be going through the same thing or have some insight into the situation. You can also talk to your dad (her ex) if you feel comfortable doing so.\n3. Reach out to a trusted teacher, school counselor, or another adult you trust. They might be able to help you get in touch with local resources or provide emotional support.\n4. If your mom is still not willing to help, you might need to consider seeking help from outside. Look into local food banks, soup kitchens, or other organizations that can provide you with meals. You can also talk to a social worker or a therapist who can help you navigate this situation.\n5. Lastly, remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and care. You're not alone, and there are people who can help. Don't give up hope.\n\nRemember, your mom's behavior is not a reflection of your worth. You are deserving of love, care, and basic human needs. Keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid to ask for help."

Focus on building genuine connections, developing your humor, and being willing to take risks. With time and effort, you'll become more comfortable in your own skin and more likely to bring joy and laughter to those around you."

What isn't normal is his inflated sense that life is all about him. If it doesn't benefit him, he doesn't do it. I have been giving him the structure, guidance and direction that he has asked for, but he's not changing. His girlfriend has been on him about his poor hygiene, but he doesn't change.\nLately, he has become withdrawn and silent, and he is by himself a lot. He literally sleeps all day. Oh, and he's a compulsive liar, so we don't know if anything he tells us is truthful. He does have depression issues and some trauma. Those signs are easy to spot in him. What gives, if you know?",
    "human": "Has your nephew been treated for his depression or trauma? Whether the answer is yes or no, it's time for him to be checked by a physician to determine whether he may be physically or possibly mentally ill or on drugs. Please don't wait to make it happen.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with your nephew's behavior. It sounds like he's facing some significant challenges, and it's great that you're concerned about his well-being.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that his behavior is not uncommon in young adults, especially those with a history of trauma and depression. His inflated sense of self-importance and lack of motivation might be a coping mechanism to deal with his emotional pain.\n\nGiven his compulsive lying, it's crucial to approach him with empathy and understanding, while also setting clear boundaries and expectations. You've been providing structure and guidance, which is great, but it seems like he's not responding to it. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns, focusing on specific behaviors rather than attacking his character.\n\nRegarding his hygiene, it's understandable that his girlfriend has been frustrated with him, but it's essential to address this issue in a non-judgmental and non-confrontational way. You could try having a calm and empathetic conversation with him about how his behavior is affecting those around him, including his girlfriend and you.\n\nHis withdrawal and sleep patterns are concerning, and it's possible that his depression is flaring up. It might be helpful to encourage him to seek professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to address his mental health. As a co-parent, you can also consider seeking support for yourself, as caring for a young adult with complex issues can be emotionally draining.\n\nTo move forward, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Continue to provide a stable and supportive environment, while also setting clear boundaries and expectations.\n2. Have open and honest conversations with your nephew about your concerns, focusing on specific behaviors rather than attacking his character.\n3. Encourage him to seek professional help to address his mental health and compulsive lying.\n4. Consider seeking support for yourself, as a co-parent, to manage the emotional demands of caring for your nephew.\n5. Focus on building trust and empathy with your nephew, rather than trying to change him overnight. Small, incremental changes can be more effective than trying to overhaul his entire behavior.\n\nRemember, your goal is to support your nephew's long-term well-being, not to fix his problems immediately. By providing a stable and supportive environment, encouraging professional help, and having open conversations, you can help him work through his issues and develop healthier habits."

Here's what I want you to know: you're not alone in this. Many people with chronic illnesses face similar challenges, and it's okay to acknowledge the emotions that come with it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your emotions are valid. It's normal to feel frustrated, anxious, and irritable when dealing with unpredictable pain. Acknowledge those feelings, and don't suppress them. Allow yourself to feel them, and then try to reframe them.\n\nOne strategy that might help is to focus on the present moment. When you're having a good day, try to savor it and enjoy the small pleasures. Don't worry too much about the future or past; instead, focus on what you can control in the present. This can help you appreciate the good days and reduce anxiety about the bad days.\n\nWhen the pain hits, try to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that it's okay to have a bad day and that it will pass. You can try journaling, meditation, or talking to a loved one to process your emotions. It's also essential to prioritize self-care during those days, whether that means taking a warm bath, reading a book, or getting a massage.\n\nIt might also be helpful to establish a routine or rituals that bring you comfort and calm. This could be as simple as making a cup of tea, listening to soothing music, or practicing gentle stretches. Having these small comforts can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\nLastly, consider seeking support from a therapist or support group. Sharing your experiences with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly powerful. You might find that talking to others who have gone through similar struggles helps you feel less isolated and more empowered.\n\nRemember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. You're not defined by your chronic illness, and you're stronger than you think. Keep in mind that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nLastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to have bad days, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to do this alone."

For example, you could ask him about his weekend, a recent event, or a shared interest. Something like:\n\n* \"Hey, did you do anything fun over the weekend?\"\n* \"How was your week? Any exciting projects at work?\"\n* \"I saw [insert shared interest here] on TV/movies/books recently, have you seen it?\"\n\nThese kinds of questions are easy to answer, and they can help you both find some common ground. Plus, they're not too probing or demanding, so you won't feel like you're putting too much pressure on the conversation.\n\nAnother approach could be to share something about yourself and then ask him to share something in return. For instance:\n\n* \"I just got back from a great hike on the weekend, have you ever been to that trail?\"\n* \"I'm trying out a new recipe, have you got any favorite cooking tips?\"\n\nThis way, you're showing interest in him and opening the door for him to share something about himself.

That's already a huge step forward.\n\nHere are some practical tips that might help:\n\n1. **Mindfulness and self-awareness**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, take a moment to acknowledge your emotions. Recognize that it's okay to feel frustrated, but don't let it consume you. Take a few deep breaths, and try to reframe the situation in a more rational light.\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge those negative thoughts! When you feel yourself catastrophizing or dwelling on a minor setback, try to reframe it as a minor inconvenience rather than a major disaster. Ask yourself, \"Is this really a big deal?\" or \"What's the worst that could happen?\"\n3. **Practice gratitude**: Make a conscious effort to focus on the things you're grateful for each day. This can help shift your perspective and reduce the emphasis on negative thoughts. Try writing down three things you're thankful for each day.\n4. **Develop a \"reset\" strategy**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, try doing something that helps you calm down, like taking a short walk, doing some stretching, or listening to calming music. This can help you \"reset\" and regain control over your emotions.\n5. **Reframe failures as opportunities**: Instead of obsessing over failures, try to see them as opportunities to learn and grow. Ask yourself what you can learn from the experience and how you can apply that to future situations.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself! Remember that everyone has setbacks and failures. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you'd offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n7. **Seek support**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend or family member and ask for their support. Sometimes just talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can help you gain perspective and develop a more balanced outlook.\n\nRemember, it's not about suppressing your emotions or pretending to be someone you're not. It's about developing strategies to manage your reactions and respond to situations in a more constructive way.\n\nLastly, I love your openness and willingness to learn. That's half the battle right there! Keep working on it, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. You got this!"

And, the only thing I can choose for small talk (or talking to anyone really) are some anecdotes, interesting facts, etc. However, the problem is sometimes I think that I'm being too vague, complex, or making the other person bored. Or perhaps, I just can't explain the idea well. \n\nI'm a brilliant explainer on chatting and stuff, but just can't do it when talking.",
    "human": "It is always easy to talk about things that are in your environment at the moment, which is the one thing that you and your audience share. If you are at a party, discuss the decor. If you are at the bus stop, discuss the traffic or a nearby building. This allows the person some space for their opinion in the conversation, because they also have an experience of it. \n\nAlso, avoid sarcasm, jargon, or any emotion laden topic like politics or religion. At least until you get to know someone fairly well.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It can be tough to translate our awesome conversational skills from online to in-person chats. Here's a simple tip to help you talk to people in a clear and concise manner:\n\n**Focus on the core idea**: When you're about to share an anecdote or interesting fact, take a deep breath and ask yourself: \"What's the main point I'm trying to get across?\" Identify the core idea you want to convey, and then focus on that. Cut out any unnecessary details or tangents that might confuse or bore the other person.\n\n**Use the 3-part structure**: Break down your thought into three parts:\n\n1. **Hook**: Grab their attention with an interesting fact or a brief story that sets the stage.\n2. **Key point**: Clearly state the main idea you want to convey. Keep it simple and concise.\n3. **Connection**: Tie the idea back to the conversation or the other person's interests. This helps keep them engaged and shows you're listening.\n\nFor example, if you're talking about a fascinating scientific discovery, you could say:\n\n\"Hey, did you know that scientists recently discovered a new species of [X]? It's really cool because it has [unique feature]. What's interesting about this is that it highlights the importance of [key takeaway]. I think it's relevant to our conversation because [connection to the topic or person].\"\n\n**Practice active listening**: Pay attention to the other person's reactions and body language. If they seem confused or disinterested, adjust your approach and try to simplify your explanation. Remember, it's not about you or your expertise; it's about connecting with the other person.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if it takes time to develop this skill. Practice makes perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. Keep working at it, and you'll become more comfortable and confident in your conversational abilities.\n\nHow's that? Any specific scenarios or topics you'd like to work on?"

I’m not sure how to bring this up to him without sounding patronising or rude.

Date someone you feel matches your maturity level and has compatible life goals.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get where you're coming from! It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and uncertain about the future with your partner. It's great that you're acknowledging your own desires and goals, and it's natural to wonder if you're compatible long-term.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing that your partner's lack of drive and lack of savings might be a concern. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge this and have these thoughts. Now, let's break it down and explore some ways to approach this conversation with your partner.\n\nBefore you talk to him, take some time to reflect on what you want to achieve from this conversation. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What are your deal-breakers? What are your hopes and expectations for your partner's growth and development?\n\nWhen you do talk to him, try to focus on your own feelings and concerns rather than attacking or criticizing his lack of drive. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and avoid blaming language. For example, you could say something like: \"Hey, I've been feeling a bit anxious about our future together. I've been thinking about my goals and aspirations, and I feel like we're on different pages. I want to be with someone who shares similar ambitions and is working towards a similar future. Can we talk about your goals and aspirations? What do you want to achieve in the next few years?\"\n\nIt's also important to listen to his perspective and try to understand his point of view. He might have valid reasons for not being as driven or motivated, and he might have different priorities or values that are important to him.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize self-care and self-reflection during this process. It's okay to take time for yourself and focus on your own growth and development. Remember that you deserve to be with someone who shares your values and goals, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires.\n\nAs for the idea of being with someone your own age, it's normal to feel drawn to people who share similar life stages and experiences. However, it's also important to recognize that relationships are about more than just age or shared goals. It's about finding someone who resonates with you, supports you, and makes you feel seen and heard. Don't dismiss your partner just yet; take the time to have an open and honest conversation, and see where it takes you."

She makes it a point to remind me that she’s from an upper class family by talking about expensive brands that I’ve never heard of and other stuff.

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It can be really frustrating to deal with someone who constantly talks about their wealth and status. Here's a suggestion: instead of trying to stop her from bragging directly, try to shift the focus back to work or other topics that are more relevant to your shared goals and interests.\n\nWhen she starts bragging, you can politely interrupt and steer the conversation towards a more neutral topic. For example, you could say something like, \"That's really interesting, but can we talk about the project we're working on and how we can improve it?\" or \"I've been thinking a lot about our team's goals, and I had an idea about how we could approach [specific task]. What do you think?\"\n\nBy doing this, you're not dismissing her or her accomplishments, but rather, you're showing that you're more interested in the work and your shared goals than in her wealth. This can help to redirect the conversation and make her feel less inclined to dominate the conversation with her wealth-related stories.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find common ground with her. You could ask her about her interests outside of work or her passions, and see if you can find something you both have in common. This can help to build a more personal connection and make her feel more comfortable sharing other aspects of herself.\n\nIt's also important to remember that people often brag about their wealth because they're trying to establish a sense of identity or belonging. So, try to listen actively and show genuine interest in her as a person, rather than just her wealth. This can help to humanize her and make her feel more relatable.\n\nLastly, if you feel like you've tried everything and she's still not willing to change the subject, it might be worth having a gentle, one-on-one conversation with her. You could say something like, \"Hey, I value our working relationship and I want to make sure we can have open and honest conversations. I've noticed that you often talk about your wealth and family, and while I'm happy for you, it can make me feel a bit uncomfortable. Would you be open to talking about other topics or sharing more about your interests outside of work?\" This approach is more about being honest and direct, while still being respectful and empathetic."

Here's a few alternative approaches you could try to bring a conversation to a close in a more polite and considerate way:\n\n1. **Use a gentle transition phrase**: Instead of \"Anyway...\", try using a phrase like \"Speaking of which...\" or \"That reminds me...\" to signal that you're moving on to something else. This can help soften the transition and make it feel more natural.\n2. **Make a comment about the time**: You could say something like, \"I should probably get going soon, but it was great catching up with you. Let's do it again soon.\" This acknowledges the conversation and expresses your appreciation for the chat while also setting a clear boundary.\n3. **Offer a specific reason for ending the conversation**: If you're worried about leaving someone hanging, you could say something like, \"I have a meeting/appointment/task I need to get to, but it was great talking to you. Let's catch up another time.\" This gives a clear reason for ending the conversation and helps the other person understand.\n4. **Use a gentle \"wrap-up\" phrase**: Try using a phrase like \"Well, I think we've covered everything...\" or \"I think we've talked enough about that...\" to signal that the conversation is wrapping up.\n5. **Be kind and appreciative**: Remember to always be kind and appreciative when ending a conversation. A simple \"Thanks for chatting with me, it was great talking to you\" or \"I appreciate the chat, let's do it again soon\" can go a long way in leaving a positive impression.\n\nRemember, the key is to be respectful, polite, and considerate when ending a conversation. You don't have to be overly formal or scripted, but a little thoughtfulness can go a long way in making the transition smoother and more pleasant for everyone involved."

Make sure you know your stuff inside out, and practice your presentation several times in front of a mirror, family member, or friend. This will help you feel more confident and in control.\n2. **Take deep breaths**: When you start to feel anxious, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system and slow down your heart rate.\n3. **Focus on your message**: Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the message you're trying to convey. Remember, you're speaking to share your ideas and insights, not to impress anyone with your speaking skills.\n4. **Visualize success**: Imagine yourself delivering a great presentation and getting positive feedback from your audience. Visualizing a positive outcome can help boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.\n5. **Use positive self-talk**: Instead of telling yourself \"I'm going to fail\" or \"I'm going to mess up,\" try using positive affirmations like \"I've got this,\" \"I'm well-prepared,\" or \"I can do this.\"\n6. **Get familiar with the setting**: If possible, visit the presentation room before the actual event. Get familiar with the podium, the audience seating, and the sound system. This can help reduce your anxiety by making you feel more comfortable with the environment.\n7. **Use physical relaxation techniques**: Try to relax your physical body by rolling your shoulders, unclenching your fists, or taking a quick stretch. A relaxed body can help calm your mind.\n8. **Get support**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend or family member. Sometimes talking about your anxiety can help you feel better and more supported.\n9. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of viewing public speaking as a source of anxiety, try to see it as an opportunity to share your ideas and connect with others. Remember, the audience wants you to succeed!\n10. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused in the moment. Take a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises to help calm your nerves.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel some level of nervousness – it's normal! But by using these tips, you can learn to manage your anxiety and deliver a great presentation. Good luck!"

I also used to have a really easy and fun sexuality, but found out more recently that I have a bit more trouble enjoying myself and that random hookups with a new person make me nervous and aren't the most satisfying. It's not trauma related or anything, I think it's just me being older, brain meds and self-doubt.\n\nI feel some kind of way about that, like, having meh sex makes me feel like my body doesn't work the way I want it to anymore. I really miss how carefree and fun sex used to be for me, it used to be a big part of my life and I feel robbed of a part of myself. I know I can still feel desire and pleasure but when I'm with a partner and can't access that it really gets me down.\n\nI've been in a bit of a better place mentally in general though and I've started socialising a lot more, which is good.\n\nI recently met a cute guy I like. We connected pretty well and had a date last weekend where we had a really fun make out session, it was unexpected for me but I really enjoyed myself. He's a little nervous and awkward at times but honestly so am I.\n\nA possible yellow flag is that he's in one of these \"open\" relationships where they both date other people but his partner doesn't want to know anything. Not my favourite situation but I'm not looking for something serious and it's unlikely I would ever meet his partner. (Edit) to clarify, I am also poly, comfortable with my single life ATM and would mostly like a nice FWB situation.\n\nWe planned a 2nd date today at my place. Yesterday he messaged me saying he wasn't sure he could make it because he got some bad news from a close friend and wasn't in the best headspace. (I found out later it involves a very sick child so I can understand). I told him we could of course reschedule, but he eventually decided to come over anyway. \n\nWe had coffee and a really nice chat but he did check his phone a few times and let me know he'd need to call his friend later in the evening. We made out again, which eventually led to sex. The making out and foreplay part was fun, but when we had sex it was really rushed and kinda rough and lasted for like a couple minutes.\n\nI was pretty confused. He said he felt like I wasn't enjoying myself as much once we started penetration and so he tried to make it quick. I told him I wasn't sure why he would think that and I'd actually have liked to take it slow and enjoy myself. I'd have felt fine if he'd taken a bit of time to take care of me afterwards but instead he got really nervous and apologetic for misjudging the situation.\n\nI think he felt pretty overwhelmed because he had to call his friend soon and at the same time he felt like he messed up and could see I was confused and kind of upset. He left quickly after that, I asked if he could call his friend and then maybe we could chill together for a bit but he said he wouldn't be feeling okay afterwards, so he just went away.\n\nHe messaged me once he got home to apologise again, said he wouldn't bother me if I didn't want to but he'd like to see me again. I'm just feeling kind of angry and really shit about myself. At the same time I get being an anxious person and I understand the situation with his friend would be pretty overwhelming so I don't want to be callous.\n\nI haven't replied to his message yet. I'm having difficulty judging if I feel like shit because of my own baggage or if he acted badly towards me. Right now I kind of want to get mad or just ghost him, but at the same time I don't often meet someone I have good chemistry with. I don't know if I should give him a chance or if he's inconsiderate and too much drama.",

I'm here to help you work through your thoughts and feelings.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel frustrated and angry after a date that didn't quite go as planned. It's especially understandable given your recent experiences with mental health and self-doubt. It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and consider what might be contributing to your emotions.\n\nNow, let's break down the situation. It sounds like your date, despite being understanding about his friend's situation, might have been a bit distracted and preoccupied. He did prioritize his friend's call over your needs and feelings, which is a significant red flag. Additionally, his rushed and rough sex, followed by his apologetic and nervous behavior, suggests that he might not be the most considerate or attuned partner.\n\nConsidering your own baggage and desires, it's essential to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. You mentioned you're looking for a nice FWB situation, and this date didn't exactly align with that. You deserve someone who can be present, respectful, and attentive in the moment.\n\nI'm not saying you should dismiss him entirely, but it's crucial to consider whether this is the kind of relationship you're willing to invest in. You've already mentioned you don't often meet someone with good chemistry, so it's essential to weigh the pros and cons.\n\nBefore responding to his message, take some time to reflect on what you want and need from a partner. Are you willing to work through his anxiety and stress with him? Can you compromise on the level of intimacy and attention you desire? Or are you looking for someone who can meet you halfway and prioritize your needs?\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize yourself and your own well-being. If you decide to give him another chance, set clear boundaries and communicate your needs openly. If not, don't be too hard on yourself for recognizing that this might not be the right fit for you.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? What do you think you might want to communicate to him, or what boundaries you'd like to set if you decide to give him another chance?"

I'll provide you with some suggestions to secure your Gmail inbox.\n\n1. **Two-factor authentication (2FA) with App Passwords**: While you have 2-step verification enabled, it's not a perfect solution. To add an extra layer of security, you can generate App Passwords for specific devices or apps. This will require an additional password for your Gmail account on your work computer. You can generate App Passwords from the Google Account settings.\n2. **Labels with Custom Notifications**: You can create labels for specific senders (e.g., PayPal, banking, company newsletters) and set custom notifications for those labels. This way, you'll receive notifications only for those specific emails, and they'll be separate from your regular inbox. You can then set a password or PIN for the device to access those notifications.\n3. **Priority Inbox with Filters**: Create filters to automatically sort incoming emails from specific senders into a Priority Inbox or a separate label. This way, you can set a password or PIN for that label, and only you'll have access to those emails.\n4. **Email encryption**: You can use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption to secure individual emails. However, this might be overkill for your needs, as it requires setting up encryption for both the sender and recipient. You can explore services like ProtonMail or Tutanota, which offer easy encryption options.\n5. **Third-party extensions**: There are browser extensions like LastPass or 1Password that can generate strong passwords and offer additional security features. Some extensions, like Email Guardian, can also help you password-protect specific emails or folders.\n6. **Device-level security**: Consider setting up a guest account on your work computer for your family member to use. This will limit their access to your personal files and emails. You can also set up a password for your computer's login or use a biometric login method (if available).\n7. **Communication with your family member**: It's essential to address the underlying issue of your family member's lack of respect for your privacy. Have an open and honest conversation with them about your concerns and boundaries. It's possible that they're not aware of the impact their actions have on you.\n\nRegarding your request to hide subject lines and previews, Gmail doesn't offer a built-in solution for this. However, you can explore third-party extensions like Email Guardian or Inbox When Ready, which can help you customize your email experience.\n\nRemember that while these solutions can improve security, they're not foolproof.

I have a feeling I’ve given offf this vibe before (except I usually don’t realize maybe I overstepped until after the fact :/), but I think the girlfriends usually let it slide because I’m usually just as good friends with the girl and they know I’d do the same thing for them hence why I’ve gone unconfronted, but I neeed to get a better sense of boundaries because of situations like today where someone might get the wrong vibe or bc I won’t always know the girlfriend and she might not know my intentions.\n\nPart of my issue is that my texts are lengthy and.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your relationships and boundaries. It's great that you're willing to learn and grow!\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that people often misinterpret intentions due to their own biases, past experiences, or insecurities. It's not necessarily about you giving off the wrong vibe, but rather about how others perceive your actions.\n\nWhen it comes to helping out your guy friends, it's great that you're considering their relationships and not wanting to overstep. Here are some tips to help you tread carefully:\n\n1. **Be mindful of your language**: As you mentioned, lengthy texts can give the impression of being overbearing. Keep your messages concise and to the point. Focus on the specific help you're offering, rather than expressing excessive concern or admiration.\n2. **Respect their boundaries**: If someone declines your offer of help, respect their decision and don't pressure them further. Acknowledge their response and move on. This shows that you value their boundaries and prioritize their comfort.\n3. **Communicate openly**: If you're unsure about someone's feelings or boundaries, have an open and honest conversation with them. Ask how they feel about your actions and listen to their response. This can help clear the air and avoid misunderstandings.\n4. **Be considerate of relationships**: When offering help, consider the dynamics of the relationship between your friend and their partner. If you're unsure how the partner might feel, it's better to err on the side of caution and ask your friend if it's okay to reach out or offer help.\n5. **Focus on your shared connections**: Instead of focusing on individual friendships, try to build connections with your friends through shared experiences, interests, or common goals. This can help shift the focus away from personal relationships and towards platonic friendships.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. The key is to be self-aware, empathetic, and willing to adapt to different situations.\n\nKeep in mind that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people navigate similar challenges in their relationships, and it's normal to feel uncertain or unsure. By being open to feedback, communicating effectively, and respecting boundaries, you can build stronger, more meaningful relationships with your friends."

That takes a lot of maturity.\n\nTo tackle this issue, I'll offer a multi-pronged approach:\n\n1. **Document everything**: Keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, and the people who witnessed the conversations. This will help you track patterns and provide evidence if needed. Be objective and factual in your notes, focusing on the behavior, not personal attacks.\n2. **Talk to a trusted third party**: Share your concerns with someone you trust, like a supervisor, HR representative, or a colleague you respect. They can offer guidance, provide a fresh perspective, and help you develop a plan to address the situation. Choose someone who's not close to either of you, to maintain objectivity.\n3. **Address the behavior, not the person**: When discussing the issue with the third party, focus on the specific behaviors that are causing harm, rather than attacking your ex-friend's character. Use \"I\" statements to express how their words have affected you, and avoid assumptions or generalizations.\n4. **Don't engage or react emotionally**: When confronted with their negative comments, resist the urge to respond or react emotionally. Instead, maintain a calm and professional demeanor. This will deprive them of the attention they're seeking and make it harder for them to continue their behavior.\n5. **Set boundaries**: If the gossip or negativity continues, it's essential to set clear boundaries. Politely but firmly tell your ex-friend that you're not interested in discussing their opinions or engaging in gossip. You can say something like, \"I understand we have different perspectives, but I'd appreciate it if we could focus on our work and not discuss personal opinions.\"\n6. **Focus on your own growth**: Channel your energy into your work and personal growth. Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and the value you bring to the company. This will not only boost your confidence but also make it harder for others to undermine your reputation.\n7. **Maintain a positive online presence**: Monitor your online profiles and ensure your social media presence is professional and respectful. This will help protect your reputation and make it harder for others to spread misinformation.\n8. **Consider a mediated conversation (if necessary)**: If the situation persists and is affecting your work or well-being, consider a mediated conversation with your ex-friend. A neutral third party can help facilitate a constructive discussion, but only if you feel it's necessary and safe for you.\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. By focusing on your own growth, setting boundaries, and maintaining a professional demeanor, you'll be better equipped to handle the situation and protect your reputation.\n\nAs for becoming friends again, it's understandable that you'd like to maintain a positive relationship, but it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries.

You could ask him about his favorite books, movies, or TV shows, or share some of your own interests and see if you have any overlap.\n\nAnother approach could be to show genuine curiosity about his thoughts and opinions on topics that aren't related to school. Ask him about his favorite travel destinations, or what he likes to do in his free time. This can help you get a sense of his personality and values beyond the academic setting.\n\nSince you're both introverts, it might be helpful to start with small, low-key interactions.

The work environment and the work itself and potential for promotion are there.

It's great that you're considering approaching your current employer with this information, as it shows you're willing to negotiate and value your relationship with them.

You mentioned the work environment and potential for promotion are important to you, so it's essential to consider how this new information might impact those aspects.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Schedule a meeting with your manager, but make sure it's not during a busy or stressful period. You want to have a calm and focused conversation.\n2. Start by expressing your appreciation for the offer and the opportunities you've had so far. Acknowledge the value you've added to the company and the reasons why you enjoy working there.\n3. Be honest and direct about the better offer you've received. Share the details, including the 37% increase in base salary. Avoid making negative comments about your current employer or colleagues.\n4. Instead of asking your manager to match the offer, reframe the conversation as a discussion about your career development and compensation. You could say something like: \"I've been with the company for [X] years and have enjoyed my time here. However, with the current market conditions, I've received an offer that's significantly higher than my current salary. I'm torn because I value my role and the team, but I also want to ensure I'm fairly compensated. Can we discuss possibilities for adjusting my compensation to better reflect my value to the company?\"\n5. Be prepared to listen to your manager's perspective and concerns. They may not be able to match the offer, and that's okay. It's essential to understand their limitations and constraints.\n6. If the answer is no, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of staying versus leaving. If the decision is solely based on salary, it might be time to consider the new offer. However, if you're willing to stay, you can negotiate other benefits, such as additional vacation days, flexible working arrangements, or professional development opportunities.\n\nRemember, this conversation is about your career development and compensation, not about beating your manager into submission. Approach the discussion with an open mind, and be prepared to make a decision that aligns with your goals and priorities.\n\nIn your words, you're suggesting a straightforward approach, which is good. Just be mindful of the tone and focus on the benefits you bring to the company, rather than solely highlighting the new offer."

    "sentence": "My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn’t paying rent. Should I break up?\nI (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad’s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she’d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and got her a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn’t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn’t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I’m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\n\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I payed for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn’t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only payed rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn’t afford it. \n\nTo be clear, it’s not about the money but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?",
    "human": "If she stopped paying rent why are you posting on Reddit and not sitting down with her is my first thought. Rents due can I have your half please?\n\nNo offer to cover the difference. If she can't afford it then why not? She knows it's due at the end of the month.\n\nIf you are going to split up with her make sure she doesn't leave you thousands in debt.\n\nHonestly I think she's lost respect for you and is taking you for a ride before leaving anyway",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and concerned about the lack of communication and financial responsibility in your relationship.\n\nFirstly, it's not about expecting too much; it's about having a sense of fairness and respect in a partnership. You've been contributing 50/50 to your shared life, including rent, and it's reasonable to expect your partner to do the same.\n\nThe fact that your girlfriend has been sporadically paying rent and not communicating about her financial situation is a significant red flag. It's not just about the money; it's about the lack of transparency, accountability, and respect for your shared life.\n\nHere's a suggestion on how to address this issue:\n\n1. Have a calm and specific conversation: Choose a time when you're both relaxed and not stressed or tired. Be specific about your concerns and feelings, using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. For example, \"I feel frustrated when I'm not sure if we're on the same page about our finances. I feel like we're not being fair to each other.\"\n2. Focus on the impact: Explain how her lack of communication and financial responsibility is affecting you, rather than attacking her or her family's wealth. You might say, \"I feel like I'm shouldering the financial burden, and it's making me feel resentful and anxious.\"\n3. Set clear expectations: Discuss what you need from your partner in terms of financial transparency and responsibility. You could say, \"I think it would be helpful if we had a joint account for our shared expenses and regularly discussed our financial situation.\"\n4. Be prepared for a reaction: Your girlfriend might become defensive or dismissive, especially if she's not used to being held accountable. Stay calm, empathetic, and firm in your expectations.\n\nBefore having this conversation, take some time to reflect on your own feelings and boundaries. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What are you willing to compromise on? What are your deal-breakers?\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, communication, and mutual respect. If your girlfriend is unwilling to work on these issues, it may be time to reevaluate whether this is a healthy and sustainable partnership for you.\n\nLastly, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or a trusted friend or family member to support you in navigating this conversation and finding a resolution."

    "sentence": "Sorry this is so long-winded,\n\ntl;dr : He is now wishy washy about marriage and I told him that is what I want or we should go separate ways. Complicated by our adorable oopsie baby and logistics of our families living far apart. I also love him and care about him a lot but don't want to suck it up and end up resenting him.\n\nContext: him and I have been together 2.5 years. We live close to his family. My family and friends live about a 20hr drive away. We were friends prior and I moved up here for work. We moved in together pretty quickly (he had just sold his house and I was relocating-so timing and convenience were a factor). We then purchased a house together last year. We still have separate finances. I am the higher earner by quite a bit. Neither of us was certain we wanted kids or marriage and it wasn’t something we were thinking about doing in the near future.\n\nSurprise, I got pregnant. Despite birth control and condoms. We were both very surprised and in shock but I was more distressed about the pregnancy. He quickly became excited about it and being a dad. We decided together to continue with the pregnancy. We discussed marriage during the pregnancy. He “jokingly” proposed to me with a candy ring. He later made it clear this was a joke. I discussed with him that it is important to me that I share a last name with my child and that if marriage wasn’t something he wanted to move forward with, we wouldn’t give the baby only his last name. He assured me this was something he wanted and we discussed moving forward with this after the baby was born. He was clear on my reasoning for this being what I want: I do love him very much, I want to be a family and that is what family looks like a means to me, I do see that as the ultimate way to demonstrate commitment and don’t want to be with someone who isn’t 100% sure of their feelings for me and our relationship, the state we are in does not recognize common-law relationships, last name, etc.,\n\nFast forward to now, our baby is 6 months old and we have had this conversation again (3 times in the last few months) about our relationship progressing and having a shared vision for the future. He is now saying he doesn’t understand why it needs to be on my timeline and that it doesn’t make sense because he thought we were progressing. He has said it is something he wants but why does it have to be now.\n\nA month or so ago, I brought it up and gave him an out. I told him that it is okay if we have different goals and timelines but that he needs to be honest with me so we can both move forward, together or apart. He is aware I wouldn’t keep our child from him or anything like that. He said it is something he wanted. I told him that his words need to be followed up with actions or they don’t hold weight. I told him that I’m not waiting around as that would lead to resentment and I don’t want a relationship or home with unhappy parents for my son to grow up in. He said he would act. Nothing came of this.\n\nI brought it up last night. I told him nothing has changed and that speaks volumes. I told him it’s clear to me that we are not on the same page and that it is okay. I told him without a shared vision of the future and what we want, our relationship can’t move forward. I also told him I deserve someone that knows what they want and is excited to be with me and be a family. I acknowledged that nothing about our situation is normal or traditional and things would be different without a baby but here we are. I gave him the opportunity to show me different but he got upset saying it “isn’t fair” and “what did he do wrong” and “he doesn’t want it to be this way”.\n\nThis situation is obviously complicated as I want to move closer to be near my family if we are not together and figuring out what that would look like with our child is a lot. I had a really bad pregnancy with complications, preterm baby and severe post Partum depression. Our baby is great now…pretty calm and content, has been sleeping through the night for a while and things overall have improved. So we are out of the newborn craziness. He is a great dad and is very caring and does a lot for me. To be clear, I am not saying we need to get married tomorrow and neither of us are on board with dumping money into a wedding (hello college fund for baby). I am asking for a concrete action that shows intent and that we are moving in that direction.\n\nAm I completely crazy for ending our relationship?

When asking someone to be your romantic partner, it's essential to approach the situation with maturity and thoughtfulness.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of asking someone to \"go out\" with you, try framing the question as a more meaningful and personal inquiry.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in exploring a more committed, exclusive relationship with me. I value our connection and would love to see where things could go between us.\"\n\nThis approach shows that you've taken the time to reflect on your feelings and the dynamics of your relationship, and that you're looking for a deeper level of commitment.

Tell them you don't want to talk to them, and mean it. Use \"I\" statements to express how their behavior is affecting you, without blaming or attacking them.\n2. **Block and restrict contact**: Use technology to your advantage. Block their number, email, and social media accounts. Change your phone number, email address, or social media handles if necessary. Consider using a VPN or email encryption to protect your online identity.\n3. **Document everything**: Keep a record of all interactions, including dates, times, and details of what was discussed. This can help you track patterns and provide evidence if needed. You can also use this documentation to help you stay focused on your goals and boundaries.\n4. **Don't engage**: Avoid responding to their messages, calls, or emails. Ignoring them can be the most effective way to starve their attention-seeking behavior. Don't give them the satisfaction of a reaction or a response.\n5. **Prioritize self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being.

A restraining order can provide a sense of security and protection.\n8. **Practice assertive communication**: When interacting with the person, maintain a calm and assertive tone. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs, and avoid getting defensive or emotional.\n9. **Don't internalize their behavior**: Remember that their behavior is a reflection of their own issues, not yours. Avoid taking their negativity or aggression personally, and try not to internalize their behavior.\n10. **Focus on the present**: Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, focus on the present moment. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or other techniques to help you stay grounded and centered.\n\nRemember, dealing with toxic individuals can be draining and emotionally taxing.

We talk about it briefly, and then I didn’t bring it up again because I was expecting a proposal.\n\nBy mid-April I realized there would be no way to have the wedding we had talked about in 2022. I bring it up and he says his relationship with his dad is making him feel depressed and he needs time to deal with his feelings. I let it go but remind him that if we do plan on having a wedding we need to at least set a date (I propose summer 2023) because many of our family members we’d want there live abroad and need plenty of time to make plans.\n\nIn July he drunkenly tells me that his dad disapproves of our relationship because he doesn’t like my family (he doesn’t know any of us directly), and that this has been weighing on him. I thought okay, he didn’t want to get married before sharing this with me and don’t think much of it.\n\nCome September I finally bring it up and ask what’s happening.

But I was wondering if you could help me understand what it is about wearing revealing clothes that makes you feel that way. Is it really just for yourself, or is there something else going on? I want to understand and support you, but I also want to be honest about my own feelings.\"\n\nBy having this conversation, you can gain a better understanding of your girlfriend's perspective and feelings, and she can gain a better understanding of yours. It's possible that you'll find common ground and a deeper connection, or you might realize that your values and preferences aren't aligning. Either way, it's a healthier and more respectful approach than suppressing your feelings or trying to change her behavior.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and needs in a relationship. You deserve to feel comfortable and happy with your partner, and it's okay to have different values and preferences."

I am an over thinker, and am quite sensitive towards what others tell me, and I find it happening more at more at work recently. When something is said to trigger my sensitivity, I would dwell on it, get upset over it and think about it non stop, thinking of all the possible scenarios that might have could have caused them to say that. \n\nI’ve tried to take deep breaths, walk away, but I lose a disgusting amount of sleep over it. I will usually calm down after a lot of effort in 5-7 days after the incident.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how I can speed up this process?",
    "human": "Howdy, I'm a therapist that specializes in trauma and suicide. One of the best things to do really is to *just breathe* to regulate the nervous system, but as one of my teen clients put it, \"that's condescending as fuck in the moment.\" It can also send people spiraling further if they have CPTSD/haven't had the opportunity (yet!) to develop the capacity to self-soothe or are otherwise dysregulated to the point where bringing focus more internally is just not a great option (like with clients with chronic pain or strong physical anxiety/trauma). So if breathing exercises aren't on the table, the best advice I have is the classic external exercise of 5-4-3-2-1 grounding:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5 - things you can see\n\n4 - things you can feel\n\n3 - things you can hear\n\n2 - things you can smell\n\n1 - taste/name something positive about yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my personal life I'm a nerd so beyond breathing exercises, like box breathing, I like to hum the ABC's or something since humming relaxes the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is stimulated when your system is dysregulated for whatever reason and it can set off more biological reactions that wig you out even further. Also a big fan of literal grounding like laying down on the floor and relaxing into it. I do that between sessions sometimes.\n\nReally anything that can regulate your system more will bring more of your executive functioning back online, so petting pets, playing with fidgets, putting on warmer or cooler clothes, or doing anything mindfully. DBT skills are great to learn for this reason. We are also contextually created people, so removing yourself from your present environment/stressor if you feel yourself starting to get activated (whatever that means for you, I usually notice myself getting more agitated or my stomach starting to ache) can do wonders. Hope this helps!",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. As an overthinker, it can be tough to quiet that critical inner voice and shake off the negative emotions that come with it. And I'm glad you're recognizing the impact it's having on your sleep and overall well-being.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's not about suppressing your emotions or avoiding the issue entirely, but rather learning to manage your reactions and thoughts more effectively.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you calm down and think more rationally when you're triggered:\n\n1. **Grounding techniques**: When you start to feel yourself getting worked up, try to focus on your five senses. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out. This helps to bring you back to the present moment and distract you from ruminating on the trigger.\n2. **Label your emotions**: When you start to feel upset, acknowledge the emotion without judgment. Say to yourself, \"I'm feeling frustrated/sad/angry right now.\" This helps to recognize and accept your emotions, rather than trying to suppress or deny them.\n3. **Reframe the situation**: Challenge your negative thoughts by reframing the situation in a more positive or neutral light. Ask yourself, \"Is this really a personal attack, or is this person just having a bad day?\" or \"Is this really a reflection of my worth, or is it just a misunderstanding?\"\n4. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has off days.\n5. **Write it out**: Sometimes putting your thoughts and feelings down on paper can help to process and release them. Try journaling or writing a letter (even if you don't intend to send it) to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper.\n6. **Mindfulness apps**: Consider using apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer that offer guided meditations and breathing exercises to help you calm down and focus.\n7. **Boundary-setting**: If you find that certain situations or people consistently trigger your sensitivity, it might be time to set some boundaries or limit your exposure to those triggers.\n\nAs for speeding up the process, it's great that you've already tried deep breathing and taking a step back. You might also consider:\n\n* **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, which can improve your mood and reduce rumination.\n* **Progressive muscle relaxation**: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body to release physical tension and promote relaxation.\n* **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your struggles with sensitivity and overthinking. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can help you feel heard and understood.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work to develop new habits and strategies.\n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to try or discuss further?"

There are limits to those, sometimes severe ones.\n\nThat said, some general tips:\n\n1) Get a drivers license. Seriously. You don't need insurance if you don't have a car, but having a license makes it easier to borrow one, and once you're an adult, rent one, on an as-needed basis. It doubles as official ID.\n\n2) Know the limits on that power of attorney doc. It will vary from place to place. \n\n3) Get a job. Seriously. You're going to need money of some sort. Just living at your sisters place on your parents dime will get really old, really fast, for her. (Possibly you as well.) You don't need much, but you need something.\n4) Make your bed, clean your room, do your dishes, take out the trash, pay your bills on time, balance your budget, etc. All those things. They're chores. They're no fun. Do them anyways. Do them on a regular basis, so they become life-long good habits. \n\n5) Help out around the place. You're going to be a long-term guest in your sisters place. Emotions are going to get on each others nerves. Being genuinely helpful around the house will help keep that stuff under control. It will still happen, but it won't be as bad. It'll also reinforce the good habits I referenced above.\n\n6) Get out of the house! Go be out there. See the world. Don't spend all your time at home playing video games/watching TV/whatever.\n\n7) Spend time IN the house, but out of your room. Be social with the people you live with. Play cards together. Pick a TV show to watch through together, something you do on a regular basis.\n\n8) Cook your own meals/Help out with meal prep. Yes, going out for a burger is fast and easy. It also is expensive and will do nothing for your health. You're young, you won't notice it for a few years, but it will happen.\n\n9) If you've got someone you want to bring home for the night, give sis a heads up BEFORE hand. You really don't want her screaming at the person first thing Saturday morning while you're taking a leak.\n\n10) Know that she'll worry about you. Text/call/whatever, so she knows where you're at and what's going on. She'll likely be giving updates on you to your parents. You want them to know what's up too.\n\n11) Write/call/etc your mom and dad. Seriously. They're helping make this happen. They want you to succeed. Make sure you work to keep them involved in your life.\n\n12) Save as much money as you can, without being a scrooge about it. Contribute to the household bills.\n\n13) Know that you're going to make mistakes. Be prepared to own the mistakes, apologize for them, and work to not make them again.\n\nOther than that, you're going to be moving out. The world is opening up for you.

So here I go.\n\nI'm 26M, Mom 45F, My sister, 19F and youngest brother 9M.\n\nMy dad passed away 5 years ago. Before he passed on, he left us A home and a piece of land that he put it under my name, the house was on my mom's name. We were in debt(not a lot) The land was bigger than the house.  After my dad passed away, I had a talk with my mom. We decided it was best to sell the house(decent 6 figures) and pay off debts, finish my studies and try to build another house in that barren land. That area was developing and value was going up. My mom is a 3 time Stroke survivor who's now in a wheelchair because she had an accident few months ago.\n\nI joined work soon after my dad's death. I have an uncle I'm close to and with his help, I was able to construct a 3 storied building. We rented out 2 and moved in one.  As dad was NOT around anymore, I decided that it was not fair that I get the building all by myself. My mom and dad had a love marriage. Mom was devastated and talked me about my sibling's future. I assured her that it was my responsibility now to take care of my siblings and her. I was talking to split the building in future.\n\n Here is the problem. My sister considered her a disney princess. Won't lift a finger, blast loud music we received noise complaints, will disrespect mom and me. Continuously ask for money even though we give her an allowance. She's friends with my ex gf who cheated on me. She knew but decided not to tell me because \"it's cool and happens all the time\"\n\nI ultimately decided that if she wanted to stay, she must cease disrespecting me and mom inside my house. She yelled that it was her house too as Dad left it. I told her dad left it land, I made it home. I gave her and ultimatum that she needs to move out by next year. Mom is saddened by it. We are immigrants in this country. Mom is worried about her safety and doesn't want her to leave. I told her that she must. I can't take the disrespect anymore. I told her that I will try to find some work for her so she can at least try to make a living instead of living off my money and yelling at me. \n\n\nI pay for literally everything. Taxes, Bills, Groceries, Loan repayments, education, car loan. I can't afford to give her 1.2k each month to spend lavishly. My sister told me that my GF was right to cheat on an asshole like me.

She tells me she needs her own car and I told her to work for one. Is there any way I can handle this without having to hurt anyone?\n\nTl;dr: My younger sister disrespected me and mom in my house.

I'm glad you're seeking advice.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for taking responsibility for your siblings' future and wanting to provide for them.

Her constant demands for money, disrespect, and refusal to contribute are not only unfair but also harmful to your relationship and your mom's well-being.\n2. The ultimatum: You're right to set boundaries and give her an ultimatum, but I understand your concerns about hurting her. It's essential to acknowledge that your mom is worried about her safety and doesn't want her to leave.\n3. The land and house: Yes, the land was left to you, but you've made it a home. It's understandable that you feel possessive about it. However, considering your mom's health and her connection to the land, it might be worth exploring ways to find a compromise.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Have an open conversation with your mom: Reassure her that you're not trying to hurt your sister, but you can't continue living with her disrespect. Explain that you're willing to work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.\n2. Explore alternatives: Instead of asking her to move out, consider proposing a compromise, such as:\n\t* Your sister could move into a separate apartment or a smaller living space within the same building, allowing her to still be close to your mom and have her own space.\n\t* You could help her find a job or vocational training to increase her independence and reduce her reliance on you.\n\t* You could also discuss ways to increase her involvement in the household chores and responsibilities, so she contributes to the household in a meaningful way.\n3. Set clear boundaries: Make it clear to your sister that disrespect and constant demands for money won't be tolerated. Establish a system for requesting help or financial support, and be consistent in enforcing those boundaries.\n4. Seek support for yourself: It's essential to prioritize your own well-being and seek support from your uncle, friends, or a therapist to help you navigate these complex emotions and situations.\n\nRemember, you can't control your sister's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. By being open, empathetic, and assertive, you can work towards finding a solution that benefits everyone involved."

I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem or potential problem.  My political and nonreligious views starkly contrast those of my immediate family, and presidential campaign season is in full swing.  When talking to most people, if they try to bring up religion or politics you can usually dismiss the topic fairly easily simply by saying you don't want to talk about it, you're not comfortable with it, or you don't really have an opinion.  However, when dealing with anyone who has a vested interest in the topic and/or you as a person, it's much more challenging.  I'll use my own situation as an example.  If my dad were to ask me something as simple as \"who are you voting for in the primaries,\" I don't see any good options: If I tell him what I actually think, it'll start a debate and I'm extremely non-confrontational (trying to argue with me will get you a deer in headlights reaction and an emotional meltdown if the demand for argument continues past that point), and the rest of my family would look down on me for committing wrongthink.  If I say I don't know/have an opinion he'll insist that it's a very simple matter to learn about the various candidates and make a decision (which isn't all wrong) and that I'm lazy and shirking my duty as a US citizen to be an informed political participant.  If I say I don't care, I'll get much the same response as not having an opinion but harsher, since having an active disinterest in politics would be worse than just not knowing what to think.  If I try to say that I don't want to/am not comfortable with having such a discussion, that will throw up a big red flag and lead to targeted, probing questions directed at me.  I can't think of any good way out of this scenario and all of the ways I can think of require lying, something I'm also not comfortable with but admittedly is better than confrontation.",

Here are some suggestions that might help you extricate yourself from these types of conversations:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When your dad asks about your political views, acknowledge his interest and show that you're listening by nodding, making eye contact, and summarizing what he's saying. This will help him feel heard and understood, which can diffuse tension.\n2. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"I don't know\" or \"I don't care,\" try using \"I\" statements that focus on your own feelings and thoughts. For example, \"I'm not feeling comfortable discussing politics right now, as it can be a sensitive topic for me.\" This approach helps to shift the focus from your opinions to your emotional state.\n3. **Set boundaries**: It's okay to say, \"I understand you're interested in discussing politics, but I'd rather not engage in that conversation right now.\" Be firm but polite, and reiterate that you value your relationship with your dad, but you need to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n4. **Change the subject**: If your dad persists, try to steer the conversation toward a different topic that you're both interested in. This can help shift the focus away from politics and create a more relaxed atmosphere.\n5. **Prepare for the \"lazy\" or \"uninformed\" label**: Anticipate that your dad might accuse you of being lazy or uninformed, and be prepared to address these concerns in a calm and respectful manner. You can say something like, \"I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable discussing politics right now. I value our relationship and would rather focus on other topics.\"\n6. **Practice self-care**: Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself in these situations. If you feel like you're being pushed too hard or feeling overwhelmed, it's acceptable to take a break or excuse yourself from the conversation.\n\nRemember, it's not about lying or being dishonest; it's about being honest about your boundaries and emotional needs.

Write down specific examples of how their behavior is affecting you, focusing on how it's making you feel rather than what they're doing. This will help you articulate your concerns and emotions more effectively.\n\nWhen you're ready, choose a time when your parents are relatively calm, and have a calm tone yourself. Explain how their behavior is making you feel: scared, anxious, unheard, and unrespected. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language.\n\nFor example: \"Mom, I feel really scared and anxious when you burst into my room at 10 pm without knocking. I feel like I'm not being respected or given space. I understand you're worried, but yelling at me and not letting me finish my tasks doesn't make me feel any better. Can we find a way to communicate that works for both of us?\"\n\nAvoid getting defensive or emotional, as this can escalate the situation.

What if we set a specific curfew or check-in time that works for both of us?

Overcoming fear of conflicts requires a mix of self-reflection, communication skills, and strategic planning. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you build confidence and assertiveness:\n\n1. **Identify your triggers**: Take some time to reflect on what specifically triggers your fear of conflicts. Is it the fear of being rejected, hurt, or embarrassed? Is it the uncertainty of the outcome? Knowing your triggers will help you prepare and address them more effectively.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's normal to feel anxious or scared. Remind yourself that you're not alone, and many people struggle with similar fears.\n3. **Communicate assertively**: When interacting with others, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs. For example, instead of saying \"You're being too loud,\" say \"I'm having trouble sleeping because of the noise, could you please keep it down?\" This helps to focus on your own feelings and avoid blame or aggression.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries and expectations with others. For instance, you can set a specific noise level or time frame for your neighbors to keep the noise down. Be firm but respectful, and be prepared to compromise.\n5. **Develop a plan for high-stress situations**: Anticipate potential conflicts and create a plan for handling them. For driving, take a few deep breaths, stay calm, and focus on your own driving. For noise complaints, write down the issue and the date, and consider involving authorities if necessary.\n6. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage your anxiety levels. This will make it easier to stay calm in high-stress situations.\n7. **Seek support**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. They can offer valuable advice, provide emotional support, and help you develop a growth mindset.\n8. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate each small victory, even if it's just a minor success. This will help build your confidence and motivation to tackle more challenging conflicts in the future.\n9. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive light. Instead of thinking \"I'll never be able to handle this,\" try \"I can handle this by staying calm and communicating assertively.\"\n10. **Be patient and persistent**: Overcoming fear of conflicts takes time and effort. Don't expect to overcome it overnight, but instead, focus on gradual progress and celebrate small successes along the way.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent, patient, and kind to yourself throughout the process. With time and practice, you'll become more confident and assertive, and your fear of conflicts will decrease."

So I don't know if it's a typical bitchy thing that women do, or whether she just doesn't have other friends or interesting things to talk about but it seems my friend's GF has somewhat enjoyment of mentioning my Ex (of 5 years) whenever she can.\n- They weren't friends before, and have only really 'known' each other for less than a year so they aren't even close. \n- Her topics are always mundane AF. (makeup, my ex, exams or some irrelevant nonsense that no one really cares to hear about)\n- She talks about my ex on a regular basis, mentioning (again) mundane things like \"oh ___ and I are going shopping this weekend\", \"___ is writing a 6 hour exam today\", \"I want to plan a girls night out and invite ___\".\n\nNeed some advice here.

    "base_reply": "The classic \"ex-talk\" conundrum! I'm here to help you navigate this situation.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and annoyed. It's natural to want to protect your relationships and boundaries, especially when someone is consistently bringing up a sensitive topic like your ex.\n\nIn this case, it's likely that your friend's girlfriend is not doing this out of malice, but rather because she's either:\n\n1. Trying to fit in or gain attention by talking about someone she knows is significant to you.\n2. Not having a strong social network or interesting topics to discuss, so she's resorting to gossip or small talk.\n3. Trying to test boundaries or see how you react, which can be a passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nSince you've tried ignoring her and it seems to have worked for a bit, here are some additional suggestions:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your friend: Approach the conversation calmly and explain how you feel. Let your friend know that you're not interested in discussing your ex with his girlfriend, and that it makes you uncomfortable. Be specific about why it bothers you (e.g., it's not relevant to your life, it's not interesting, or it feels like gossip).\n2. Set boundaries with his girlfriend: If your friend's girlfriend continues to bring up your ex, you can politely tell her that you're not interested in discussing it. You can say something like, \"Hey, I understand you're trying to be friendly, but I'd appreciate it if we could focus on other topics. I'm not really interested in talking about my ex.\"\n3. Encourage other topics: When your friend's girlfriend starts talking about mundane things, try to steer the conversation towards more interesting or relevant topics. You can ask her about her interests, hobbies, or goals, or share something about yourself that you think she might find interesting.\n4. Consider having a conversation with your friend's girlfriend separately: If the behavior persists and you feel comfortable doing so, consider having a conversation with his girlfriend directly. Approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and explain how her behavior is affecting you. This can help her understand your perspective and potentially change her behavior.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself in this situation. It's okay to set boundaries and assert yourself when needed."

    "human": "A lot of answers focused on your specific ask, but I want to say that it’s normal and healthy to feel a wide range of emotions (angry, frustrated, sad, etc.) following a situation like your example. \n\nI think everyone should give themselves time to process these things in quiet reflection - how it made you feel, why it made you feel the way it did, will you do anything about it or leave it be and move on. \n\nAfter that time is up, I find chores to be an effective stress reliever and mental palate cleanser.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's tough to bounce back from a rough interaction, especially when it's with someone close to you or someone who's trying to bring you down. Here's what's worked for me:\n\nFirst, acknowledge your emotions. It's normal to feel upset, angry, or hurt when someone disrespects you. Don't try to suppress those feelings or pretend they don't exist. Instead, give yourself permission to feel them. Recognize that it's okay to not be okay.\n\nNext, take a time-out. Sometimes, we just need a breather to process our emotions and calm down. Take a few minutes to step away from the situation, take some deep breaths, and focus on your physical sensations. Feel the ground beneath your feet, the air on your skin, or the sensation of your feet touching the ground. This helps ground you and brings you back to the present moment.\n\nNow, reframe the situation. Try to see it from a different perspective. Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about what you can learn from the experience. What did you do that might have contributed to the argument or conflict? What could you do differently next time? Focusing on what you can control and what you can learn from the situation helps shift your attention away from the negative emotions.\n\nLastly, practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself. Remember that you're human, and you're going to have imperfect interactions with others. It's not your fault if someone else is being hurtful or disrespectful. You didn't deserve it, and you didn't deserve to be treated that way.\n\nTo prevent the negativity from lingering, I recommend doing something you enjoy. Engage in an activity that brings you joy, whether it's reading, taking a walk, or chatting with a friend. This helps shift your focus away from the negative and towards the positive.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time to process your emotions. But don't let one bad interaction define your day or your mood. You have the power to choose how you respond to it, and by following these steps, you can bounce back and move forward with a positive attitude."

One grew close to me, a younger man who is just now starting his career, fresh out of school. \n\nHe kept flirting with me while we were together at work, and I resisted b/c of the significant age gap and b/c I knew he had a g/f (F21); I had seen them together at an event. \n\nHe enjoys smoking marijuana, which his girlfriend HATES. \n\nI don't smoke it like I used to, but I don't mind if others do, and I understand how powerful a tool it can be for the creative process. We start hanging out and smoking together. He brings it over. He wants to come by and smoke it when his g/f \"won't let him.\" \n\nWe work on music together... art, photography, videos; we really start to bond. We don't just get high and hang out; we go places together, we make meals with each other, we talk about our goals &amp; dreams; I want to show him and teach him all that I know about what he's interested in. \n\nThe girlfriend gets angry with him because she hates the pot and wants him to get out of the creative field he went to school for and get a \"real job,\" like HVAC or plumbing like her Dad does. When she's really mad, she runs back to her ex, which tears my friend apart.\n\n\nAt first we just stay friends and it's cool.\n\n I realize a lot of my feelings are probably maternal towards him; I can tell he hasn't been exposed to a lot of the world, or to that much higher culture, and I want to teach him things and make his life easier, b/c I see that he's very talented.\n\nOne night, while he and the g/f are experiencing one of their \"breaks,\" things go a little too far. \n\nHe wants me to come see some renovations he's been doing on his house (he's redoing an old place of his father's). After the general tour, he says he wants to show me something special in the bedroom (uh oh) and lies down on the bed and asks me lay beside him and look up at a skylight he's put in, to \"look at the stars.\"\n\nWe lay there for what seems like an eternity, staring into each other's eyes (I know, it's SO cheesy), sighing, and then finally we start to kiss.\n\n But I get up and stop it, saying, \"This is wrong. We really shouldn't do this.\" \n\nHe seems disappointed but not upset. He doesn't push it. \n\nWe stay away texting and phone wise for a couple weeks after this, but still see each other at work and are just as friendly as ever. \n\nOne day he comes up to me and says he has to talk to me. \n\nWe get off work and go to my place, where he starts crying and saying his girlfriend is pregnant and he doesn't know what to do.\n\nThat he doesn't really love her, he thinks he loves *me,* and he isn't sure if the baby is his or her ex's, since they've gone \"back and forth\" so much. \n\nI can't lie, I have strong feelings for this man, despite his youth. \n\nI feel very SEEN and appreciated when I'm with him, like he's almost dazzled by me, whereas usually I'm the one begging for more attention in a relationship. \n\nI know that's selfish, but I want advice and I'm keeping it real. So a part of me, NGL, is thrilled. \n\nBut then I think \"SHE'S PREGNANT. OH DEAR LORD HOW CAN YOU DO THIS, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?\"\n\nThen, much to my shock and horror,  *I* start to cry and admit to him that I've imagined myself with him, too, but that a part of what attracts me to him is me knowing what a good guy I know he is, deep down inside,  and that good guys don't walk away from their responsibilities. \n\nI cannot ask him to abandon his g/f, who may be carrying his child, just  to have him be with me, because that's selfish and wrong.\n\nHe says he understands and leaves. \n\n\nWell, now I'm miserable.\n\n I completely ignore him at work and he looks extremely hurt.

It's understandable that you're struggling with your feelings and the situation.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you did the right thing by recognizing the importance of his responsibilities and not encouraging him to abandon his pregnant girlfriend. That takes a lot of integrity and self-awareness.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that your feelings for him are real and valid. It's okay to admit that you miss him and that you've developed strong emotions for him.\n\nAs for what to do next, I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you truly want and need in this situation. Are you willing to accept that he's committed to someone else, even if it's not the healthiest relationship? Or are you willing to take a chance on him, knowing that it could mean hurting someone else?\n\nIt's also important to consider the potential consequences of rekindling a romantic relationship with someone who's already in a committed relationship. You've already acknowledged that you don't want to encourage him to abandon his responsibilities, but what about the potential impact on his girlfriend and any future children?\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but I would encourage you to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take the time to figure out what's best for you. If that means staying distant and moving on, then so be it. But if you do decide to reach out to him again, make sure you're doing it with a clear head and a willingness to consider the potential consequences.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs in this situation."

No real advice here except perhaps stop drinking so much",
    "base_reply": "I understand your frustration, and it's great that you're prioritizing open communication with your partner. It's essential to address this issue in a respectful and empathetic manner.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that your boyfriend's concerns about consent are valid. While you may have given consent beforehand, it's reasonable for him to worry about the potential impact of alcohol on your decision-making capacity. It's not just about you wanting him to have sex with you; it's about ensuring that you're both comfortable and willing participants.\n\nInstead of trying to convince him that you're okay with it, I suggest having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and boundaries. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Choose a calm and non-confrontational setting: Find a private and comfortable spot where you both feel relaxed and can have a genuine conversation.\n2. Acknowledge his concerns: Start by acknowledging your boyfriend's concerns about consent and the potential risks associated with sex while under the influence. Let him know that you understand where he's coming from.\n3. Share your feelings: Express your feelings and desires in a non-judgmental and respectful manner. You can say something like, \"Hey, I know you're worried about the consent thing, and I get it. But for me, drinking can actually make me feel more comfortable and relaxed, and it's a part of my sexuality. I want to be open with you about that.\"\n4. Discuss boundaries: Work together to establish boundaries and guidelines that make you both feel comfortable. You might consider setting a rule that you both agree to, such as not having sex when one or both of you are significantly intoxicated.\n5. Practice active listening: Make sure to listen attentively to your boyfriend's concerns and validate his feelings. Avoid becoming defensive or dismissive, as this can create more tension and make it harder to find a resolution.\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship. By being open, honest, and respectful, you can work together to find a solution that respects both of your desires and boundaries.\n\nAs for your question about getting him to understand that you want him when you're drunk, I'd say that's not the most effective approach. Instead, focus on understanding his concerns and finding a compromise that works for both of you. By doing so, you'll build trust, strengthen your communication, and create a more positive and respectful dynamic in your relationship."

    "sentence": "Please please please know that my boyfriend is a very good person and that I love him very much, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point because I can’t compete with his life anymore, and I really need some advice.\n\nFull disclosure: My boyfriend and I moved very quickly in our relationship. It was the type of instant and intense “love at first sight” where it felt almost uncanny how similar we were..\n\nI felt such an instant and intimate connection to him that I didn’t think twice about quitting my career and moving to a different state with him quite quickly, and despite that risk it actually worked out really well until recently.\n\nI began noticing last winter that I felt more like an accessory to my boyfriend’s life, and that he seemed like he was still living a bachelor life. The first major fracture of our relationship was when he merged businesses with a friend on a whim and moved cities to go work with him, meaning that instead of being home every night like he normally was, he was gone 3-4 days a week. I won’t lie to say that I was furious. I wanted to be happy and supportive of his business decisions, but he made literally no effort in discussing this to me beforehand.\n\nThe next fracture came from something that I had signed up for willingly, but it has become a problem as I’ve grown to start feeling resentful. My boyfriend owns a business with his family, who he is extremely close with. All of his time when he is back home gets put into the family business. In the beginning, I was really enthusiastic about this business, and I would volunteer time to get to know his parents and the community better, but now I want nothing to do with it because it feels like there’s way too much expectation for me to engage with it.\n\nHis parents were very welcoming to me, and they entrusted me to do a lot with the business which I was happy to do, but now that my boyfriend is gone most of the week, it seems like even more of my time is being spent maintaining aspects of my boyfriend’s life instead of me trying to carve a place for myself in my new home.\n\nThen there’s the problem that when my boyfriend is at home, all of his time goes into this family business, and so I feel even further away from the main cast of his life. Weirdly enough, now I’m much closer with my boyfriend’s sister than I am with my boyfriend, as her and I hang out and talk more than I do with him, which would be a lovely and beautiful thing if I also had that with my boyfriend, but instead I feel that if it weren’t for his sister supporting me, I’d be abandoned.\n\nFinally the last major fracture is the dog we have together. Our dog is a highly energetic breed and requires a lot of attention and time. This was no issue in the beginning and the dog always felt naturally like “my dog” but it was the expectation that both my boyfriend and I would take care of her. Yet now our dog seems to have been back-seated, just like me. \n\nFor example, if I’ve asked my boyfriend to watch the dog because I’m vacuuming or cooking or even want time by myself, he will take her for 20 minutes and then eventually lose concentration until she comes to find me in hopes I will play with her.\n\nI actually had a bit of a freakout about this when my boyfriend and I were invited to a big family celebration a few weeks ago. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to bring the dog because she is way too excitable around people and I just wanted to focus on meeting some of his extended family and making a good first impression with them, since he is so close to his family. My boyfriend begged me to take the dog with us because he missed her.\n\nI reluctantly agreed, only because he swore that “he would take care of her and that there would be a lot of other dogs there.” My boyfriend also promised he wouldn’t drink because my car was in the shop and we had to drive his vehicle, which is standard and something I can’t drive because I never learned how to drive stick. \n\nWe show up, and embarrassingly we are the only people there with a dog. My boyfriend abandoned me almost immediately to spend time and to catch up with his family members, who I couldn’t meet because my dog is extremely excitable around people, so I have to stay in the outer circle of the fun with her so that she can remain relaxed. \n\nWorse yet is the hostess, and a few people who helped her set up, swung by and commented that “they were hoping that this would be a no-dog party” and that “they would make sure I know next time when dogs aren’t allowed” and it felt so awfully embarrassing to me that I nearly cried. \n\nThere I was, all alone at a party where I don’t know anyone, with an animal tied to my hand which clearly was extremely unwelcomed, and to make it worse now looks like it was my idea because I’m hanging on the sidelines avoiding people instead of socializing.\n\nEven more devastating was when I did finally find my boyfriend, he was already halfway to being drunk, to which he laughed and said to me “we can just take a taxi!” Through gritted teeth, I then told him “We can’t. We have the dog!” \n\nThe only thing that saved us was my boyfriend’s extremely nice uncle, who I think was a mind reader or something. He came up to me, as I was nearly in tears and asked me how I was getting home. I explained the situation and he gave me the keys to his car so that me, the dog and my boyfriend could get home that night.\n\nThat last situation very much felt like the final straw and we had a massive blow out about it. It wasn’t the first conversation we had about this type of thing, and yet over and over and over again my boyfriend keeps telling me “I’m #1” and “tell me what to do so I can change.”\n\nBut I don’t want to be that person who is the dictator in someone else’s life and keep putting up ultimatums. I don’t want to have to feel like I’m competing with someone else’s life or like I have to explain to them how to treat me like a girlfriend instead of just some afterthought.\n\nWe had a conversation again last night where I told him I was unhappy, and I asked him if he understood why. I was hoping, praying, that from all of our conversations he would know. And yet all he could say was that he could tell I was unhappy in our relationship but he didn’t understand what for.\n\nI went numb. It feels like if I walked out tomorrow nothing in his life would change, except maybe he wouldn’t have to have conversations anymore about how impossible it is to make me happy.\n\nI just feel like an accessory and it hurts so bad.\n\nYet I still don’t know if this relationship is worth giving up because my boyfriend does love me and we align so well in our life goals. \n\nI finally broke down and spilled the beans to his sister, who calmly said “My brother is a good man and I can see he loves you very much, but he’s always been immature in his relationships and his idea of compromising is him saying he’s willing to compromise.” She then told me that she would support me no matter what I do.\n\nDoes anyone know what I can do?\n\nHas anyone ever felt like an accessory in their relationship?\n\n**TL;DR:** My boyfriend continues to live his life as a bachelor despite me living with him and us building a life together. He makes big decisions by himself without talking to me about them, and I feel like I have to run his life when he’s gone. His total freedom in his life makes me feel chained to maintaining our relationship instead of us being equal life partners. Is it over?",
    "human": "Yes. I was an accessory in an ex’s life. He wasn’t willing to carve out a life for us, I was there peripherally, entirely on his terms. He “didn’t get” why I was unhappy either.  It’s because he and your boyfriend ARE living the lives they want. It’s almost as if they feel THEIR happiness should be enough for you. Spoiler alert, it isn’t. I went and found someone who wanted to build a life WITH me instead of adding me to his. I recommend you do so as well.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated, hurt, and uncertain about the future of your relationship. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your story, and I'm here to offer some support and guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your feelings are valid. You're not being unreasonable or clingy; you're simply seeking a more equal and fulfilling partnership. It's normal to feel like an accessory when your partner prioritizes their own life and interests over yours.\n\nRegarding your boyfriend's immaturity in relationships, it's not uncommon for people to grow and mature in their relationships. However, it's crucial to consider whether your partner is willing to put in the effort to change and work on your relationship.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. **Communicate your feelings clearly**: Continue to express your concerns and feelings to your boyfriend. Try to avoid blaming or accusing language, as this can lead to defensiveness. Instead, focus on how his actions make you feel and what you need from him to feel more connected and valued.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship. Discuss what you're comfortable with and what you're not. Be specific about what you need from him in terms of communication, attention, and support.\n3. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities and hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment. This will help you maintain your sense of identity and confidence, making it easier to navigate the relationship.\n4. **Evaluate the relationship**: Take time to reflect on whether this relationship aligns with your values, goals, and needs. Ask yourself if you're willing to continue compromising on issues that are crucial to you.\n5. **Seek support**: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to discuss your feelings and concerns.\n6. **Consider counseling**: Couples therapy can be an excellent way to work through issues and develop healthier communication patterns. A professional can help you both identify patterns and work on building a more equal and fulfilling partnership.\n7. **Be prepared for the possibility of change**: If your boyfriend is unwilling to work on his issues and prioritize your needs, it may be necessary to reevaluate the relationship. Remember that you deserve a partnership that values and respects your feelings and needs.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in feeling like an accessory in your relationship. Many people have felt the same way, and it's not a reflection of your worth or lovability. You deserve a relationship that is built on mutual respect, trust, and communication.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to take your time and reflect on your feelings. You don't have to make any rash decisions or sacrifices. Take care of yourself, and remember that you deserve a relationship that makes you feel seen, heard, and valued."

I'm here to offer some advice that might help you find a balance between being honest about your feelings and maintaining a positive relationship with your brother.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to have differing opinions and feelings towards your brother's partner. It's natural to have strong emotions when you don't click with someone, but it's essential to recognize that your brother has made his choice, and you need to respect that.\n\nFor yourself and your family members who share your concerns, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: If you find yourself getting angry or stressed when interacting with your brother's partner, it's essential to establish some emotional boundaries.

Be specific about what's bothering you, but avoid being overly critical or judgmental. Approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and listen to his perspective as well. This might help you both understand each other better and find common ground.\n3. **Focus on shared values and interests**: Instead of dwelling on your dislike for his partner, try to focus on the things you have in common with your brother. Engage in activities or hobbies you both enjoy, which can help strengthen your bond and create positive memories.\n4. **Support your brother's relationship (from a distance)**: Even if you don't get along with his partner, it's crucial to support your brother's relationship. Avoid criticizing or undermining his partner behind his back, as this can create tension and damage your relationship with your brother. Instead, focus on being a supportive and loving sibling, even if you don't always see eye-to-eye.\n5. **Set an example for others**: If you're concerned about the way your family members are treating your brother's partner, try to set a positive example. Be kind, respectful, and courteous in your interactions with her, even if you don't always agree. This can help create a more positive atmosphere and show your brother that you're committed to maintaining a healthy and loving relationship with him.\n6. **Practice self-care**: Lastly, don't forget to prioritize your own well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and take time for self-reflection. This will help you cope with the stress and emotions that come with navigating a difficult situation.\n\nRemember, you can't change how others behave, but you can control how you respond to the situation. By setting boundaries, communicating openly, and focusing on shared values, you can maintain a positive relationship with your brother while still being honest about your feelings."

First of all, kudos to you for being aware of your limitations and not wanting to just give empty words of encouragement.

They're looking for someone to listen, validate their emotions, and offer some sense of comfort. So, instead of trying to come up with something profound to say, you could try the following:\n\n1. Acknowledge their feelings: \"I can tell you're really upset/stressed/frustrated. That sounds tough.\"\n2. Show empathy: \"I can imagine how frustrating it must be to feel like you're not doing well in school. I'd feel that way too.\"\n3. Validate their experience: \"It's okay to not do well on a test. It's not a reflection of your worth as a person.\"\n4. Offer a listening ear: \"Can you tell me more about what's going on? What's been stressing you out about this test?\"\n\nRemember, your partner is not looking for you to fix the problem or make it go away. They just need someone to be present and understanding. By doing so, you can create a safe space for them to process their emotions and feel heard.\n\nAs for what you shouldn't say, here are a few things to avoid:\n\n* \"You'll get it next time\" or \"Just try harder\" - these can come across as dismissive or unhelpful.\n* \"It's not that bad\" or \"It's not the end of the world\" - these can minimize their feelings and make them feel like you're not taking their struggles seriously.\n* \"You're just being dramatic\" or \"It's all in your head\" - these can be really hurtful and invalidating.\n\nBy being present, empathetic, and non-judgmental, you can be a great support system for your partner during this challenging time."

    "sentence": "TL;DR I lied to make my potentially dubious-looking friendships look less bad to my bf, wanting to avoid questioning. I knew that this was a dealbreaker for him. What can I do to fix this cycle?\n\nWe have had trust problems from 2 months ago when I avoided a question about my casual dating history. He questioned me until I told him that there were 2 guys I had hooked up with a year ago whom I still kept a distant platonic friendship with. He didn't trust me when I told him nothing had happened since and that the guys knew I was in a relationship, because I had tried to avoid telling him about them entirely. To fix this we decided I should tell the guys that I was in a relationship with my bf specifically. When he asked me to tell him what I had texted them, I lied that I had told them the full story when actually I had only started the conversation. I felt awkward dropping names with guys who didn't really care to know much about my relationships, and had intended to tell them about my bf in a longer chain of texts. Because of this further deception, we decided that to fix it I should cut the 2 guys out of my life, and I did.\n\nI just came back from a trip with my long-time close friend (28M). I told bf about this friend and how we had met when he tutored me when I was 12, and we had become friends for over 8 years now after ending the tutoring. My bf was suspicious of this friend being a creep and having groomer tendencies due to the age gap. In the midst of defending my friend, my bf asked how many rooms the Airbnb we stayed at on the trip had. I lied and said 2 when there had only been 1. In fact my friend and I are both in relationships and intended to sleep separately, and the place was advertised for 4 people, but the landlord made a mix-up with the sofabed that meant there was only 1 bed that we agreed to share. Absolutely nothing happened and boundaries were drawn, but in the moment I was afraid that my bf would have more reason to doubt my friendship, so I lied about the room situation. In hindsight it seems almost improbable that this chain of events leading to there being only 1 bed was coincidental, and I have no way of verifying this myself except for asking my friend for evidence.\n\nMy bf doesn't trust me and thinks I am a shitty person. I know trust is non-negotiable. In both situations I lied because I was afraid of the backlash from my bf of how my friendships looked, and believed I shouldn't receive suspicion about them because I have never crossed boundaries. But I have no excuse for crossing a line that is always worse than whatever I have to gain from avoiding the discomfort of a conversation. Can this be fixed?

While it's understandable, it's essential to recognize that this approach is not only harmful to your relationships but also to your own well-being.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that trust is built on transparency, honesty, and vulnerability. Your lies have created a sense of uncertainty and mistrust in your relationship, which will be challenging to overcome. However, it's not impossible to repair.\n\nTo break the cycle of deception, you need to acknowledge the harm caused by your actions and take responsibility for them. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Acknowledge your mistakes**: Recognize that your lies were wrong and hurtful. Apologize sincerely to your boyfriend for your actions, and explain the reasons behind your decisions. Be honest about your fears and insecurities, but avoid making excuses.\n2. **Be transparent**: Share the truth about your relationships, including the trip with your long-time friend. Be prepared to answer his questions and provide evidence to support your claims. This might be uncomfortable, but it's essential to demonstrate your commitment to honesty.\n3. **Work on rebuilding trust**: Trust takes time to rebuild, and it will require consistent effort from both parties. Focus on open communication, follow-through on your commitments, and be willing to listen to your boyfriend's concerns.\n4. **Identify triggers**: Reflect on what triggered your lies and how you can address those insecurities in the future. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these issues.\n5. **Re-evaluate your relationships**: Take a closer look at your friendships and assess whether they align with your values and priorities. Consider whether these friendships are healthy and respectful for you and your partner.\n\nRemember that fixing this cycle of deception will require patience, effort, and commitment from both you and your boyfriend. It's not a guarantee that your relationship will survive, but it's essential to take responsibility for your actions and work towards rebuilding trust.\n\nIn terms of stopping this cycle in the future, it's crucial to develop emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and effective communication skills. Practice honesty and vulnerability in your relationships, and prioritize transparency and open communication.\n\nLastly, remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you can be your authentic self and build trust with your partner. If your current relationship is not providing that, it may be worth re-evaluating whether it's the right fit for you."

Don't try to suppress those feelings or pretend they're not there. Instead, give yourself permission to feel them, and remind yourself that they're temporary.\n\nNext, take a few deep breaths and try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what's not working, try to identify what's working. What small victories can you celebrate? What small steps can you take to move forward? Sometimes, when we're feeling stuck, we can get so focused on the big picture that we forget about the little things that are going well.\n\nNow, let's talk about finding answers. Sometimes, we get so caught up in our own thoughts and feelings that we forget to look outside of ourselves for help. Reach out to someone you trust - a friend, family member, or mentor. Sometimes, all we need is someone to talk through our problems with us. And don't be afraid to ask for help! It's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to ask for guidance.\n\nAnd finally, remember that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to not know what's going to happen next. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to focus on what you can control in the present moment. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have all the answers. Instead, focus on taking small, incremental steps towards your goals, and trust that the rest will fall into place.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this.

Unfortunately, this type of comment can be a subtle form of ageism, implying that you're too old for your boyfriend.\n\nAs you said, your boyfriend thinks you don't look old, and you agree. However, societal norms and beauty standards often prioritize youth, and people might make assumptions about age based on appearance. It's not uncommon for people to comment on age differences in relationships, but it's rarely done in a respectful or appropriate manner.\n\nIt's important to remember that your relationship is about more than just physical appearance.

We don't hang out or text on a daily basis but we talk  sometimes and he's been texting me more often because of her christmas    present.\n\nWe do those huge get togethers at christman where all of our family, partners and family  friends (so also my bestie/roommate) are invited to my parents house and we just eat, drink and play games all night long. We have a group chat for planning purposes. My sister and her boyfriend are also in there. As  well as other family members, friends of my parents, neighboors and relatives. We all live close by.\n\nI recently moved in with my best friend and got a new bed a few days  ago. I couldn't get it upstairs on my own (big boxes and far too heavy)  so I texted in the group if anyone is close by to halp me. My sisters  boyfriend (Fake Name Jake) said he's in my area and will come over. He  did and he helped me to set it up. It took maybe an hour in total and I  offered that he can have dinner with me as a thank you. I made a pizza, we ate and talked about the upcoming christmas.\n\nNothing happened. We just talked as friends. He left and an hour later my  sister called me to accuse me of being into her boyfriend. She told me that I have enough guy friends and guys that are into me that could have  helped but I had to choose HER BOYFRIEND.\n\nI  have told her several times that I am not interested in Jake and that  there's nothing to worry about. She didn't believe me and just cussed me  out. She said things like I'm a (woman that liks to have sex with many men) and I'm not allowed to come to  the get together. I talked to my parents.

    "base_reply": "Wow, this is quite a situation! I'm here to help you navigate it.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable that your sister is feeling insecure about her relationship, especially given her history of self-doubt about her looks. It's possible that her insecurities are causing her to misinterpret your actions and Jake's help.\n\nRegarding your actions, it seems like you were genuinely appreciative of Jake's help and wanted to show your gratitude by inviting him for dinner. I don't think it's unreasonable to do so, especially since he went out of his way to assist you. It's not like you were trying to flirt with him or send any mixed signals.\n\nHowever, I can see why your sister might feel uncomfortable about the situation. It's natural to feel possessive about one's partner, especially after being in a relationship for three years. Perhaps your sister is feeling threatened by the idea that you're still capable of being friendly with her boyfriend, which is a normal part of having a social life.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to have an open and honest conversation with your sister. Acknowledge her feelings and concerns, and reassure her that your intentions are pure. You could say something like, \"Hey, sis, I know you're worried about me and Jake, but I want to assure you that I'm not interested in him romantically. I was just grateful for his help and wanted to show my appreciation. I value our family relationships and wouldn't do anything to jeopardize them.\"\n\nIt's also important to have a conversation with Jake about the situation. Let him know that your sister is feeling insecure and that you'd appreciate it if he could be more mindful of her feelings in the future. It's possible that Jake is not aware of the impact his actions are having on your sister, and a gentle reminder might help him be more considerate.\n\nLastly, I think it's essential to have a mediated conversation with your sister and Jake together. Your parents might be able to help facilitate a constructive discussion, or you could consider talking to a trusted family friend or counselor. It's crucial to resolve this issue before Christmas, as it could cause unnecessary tension and stress during the holiday season.\n\nRemember, communication is key in situations like this. Be patient, empathetic, and honest, and I'm sure you'll be able to find a resolution that works for everyone involved."

Before we started dating, he already had a good female friend that i am totally okay with and met a few times, since they already knew each other for a long time and see each other only from time to time.\n\n1 or 2 months ago he found a new female friend who is a student at the college we both attend. I am not against the idea of him finding new female friends in general, but i do feel suspicious of their friendship because they see each other quite regularly (about once a week, they live 1 minute apart). I currently only see him once a week as well. And they exclusively meet in the evenings or at nighttime by themselves in either of their apartments while drinking alcohol and watching a movie on a couch or bed.\n\nI told him that i am uncomfortable with him doing that and that i'd feel much safer if they met during daytime or at another place that isn't either of their apartments. However he refuses to compromise and accused me of having trust issues. He claims that they can only meet up in private places because she has \"serious issues\" that he wants to listen to and help with, and they're apparently serious enough that i am not allowed to know about them. Keep in mind that they haven't known each other for a long time and that he doesn't do that with either of his other friends, male or female.\n\nSo reddit, what are your thoughts on this?

    "base_reply": "I'm here to offer you a neutral and honest perspective. It's completely reasonable to feel concerned about the situation, and I'm not here to tell you that you're being crazy. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're uneasy about the frequency and setting of their meetups. Seeing someone you trust only once a week, and then finding out that your boyfriend is spending quality time with this new friend in private settings, can be unsettling. It's natural to wonder if there's more to it than just a casual friendship.\n\nSecondly, the fact that your boyfriend is unwilling to compromise and explain what's going on with his new friend is concerning. If he's genuinely trying to help her with serious issues, it's reasonable to expect him to be more open about the nature of their relationship. His refusal to share details and his defensiveness might indicate that there's more to the story.\n\nLastly, the fact that he's not meeting his new friend in public or during the day like he does with his other friends raises some red flags. It's possible that he's prioritizing this friendship over yours, which can be a sign of emotional investment or even something more.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that your boyfriend is definitely being unfaithful or that there's an ulterior motive behind his friendship. However, it's essential to have open and honest communication with him about your concerns. You've already expressed your feelings, and it's time for him to listen and work with you to find a compromise.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Have a calm and specific conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Avoid accusatory language and focus on your feelings and needs.\n2. Ask him to explain what's going on with his new friend, and why they're meeting in private settings. Be prepared to listen actively and try to understand his perspective.\n3. Reiterate your boundaries and express how you feel when you're not included in his life or when you don't know what's going on. Be clear about what you're comfortable with and what makes you feel safe.\n4. If your boyfriend continues to be uncooperative or dismissive, it may be a sign that he's not taking your feelings seriously or that there's something more going on. In this case, it might be wise to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it's healthy for you.\n\nRemember, relationships are about communication, trust, and mutual respect. If your boyfriend is unwilling to work with you to address your concerns, it may be a sign that he's not the right partner for you."

This will help you avoid snapping back at them, which can escalate the situation.\n2. **Don't take it personally**: Remember that their comment is often a reflection of their own insecurities, not your worth as a person. Try to separate their words from your self-worth.\n3. **Use humor (carefully)**: If you're comfortable with it, you can respond with a lighthearted joke or a witty remark that pokes fun at the situation.

It's not necessary or helpful.\"\n6. **Limit interactions**: If someone consistently makes you feel bad about yourself, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. Your mental health and wellbeing are important, and surrounding yourself with people who uplift and support you is crucial.\n7. **Model good behavior**: Show others how to treat people with kindness and respect by being mindful of your own words and actions. When you do this, you're more likely to attract like-minded people who will treat you with respect.\n\nRemember, you don't have to tolerate behavior that makes you feel bad about yourself.

You can start with something as simple as \"How's your semester going?\" or \"What do you think of the professor?\" and go from there.\n5. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key when making friends. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have.

Everyone has to deal with being alone at some point. Even if you lived with just her your whole life, one day she will die and then the roles are reversed. You visit her every week. I don’t even hang out with certain friends that often. You shouldn’t change anything you’re doing because of her. She’s the one who’s going to have to learn to cope with her empty nest syndrome. If I were you I’d gently recommend counseling, but don’t try to compromise any more than you have been. You’ll just be stunting your own growth.",
    "base_reply": "I can sense the guilt and concern you're feeling towards your mom's situation. It's great that you're aware of her loneliness and sadness, and you're visiting her regularly, which is a thoughtful gesture.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal for your mom to feel this way, especially since she's used to having you around. However, as you've pointed out, you're almost 20 and it's essential to start building your independence.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of making a hasty decision to move back in, why not have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your feelings and concerns? Let her know that you care about her and understand her loneliness, but you also need to prioritize your own life and goals.\n\nYou could say something like, \"Mom, I know it's tough for you to adjust to not having me around, and I'm sorry it's causing you so much sadness. I want to make it clear that I love you and value our relationship, but I also need to focus on my own life and future. I've made commitments and plans, and I don't want to disrupt those. However, I'm willing to find ways to spend more quality time with you and make sure you're not feeling too lonely. Perhaps we can explore other ways to stay connected, like regular video calls or weekend visits?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're empathetic towards your mom's feelings while also setting clear boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. It's essential to be firm but gentle in your communication, as your mom may still be struggling with the idea of you moving out.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own life and goals while still maintaining a strong relationship with your mom. You can still be there for her and support her without sacrificing your own well-being."

It's a common phenomenon, and I'm happy to help you tackle it.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to have these thoughts. It's human nature to wonder about what could be out there. The key is to strike a balance between appreciating what you have and being open to growth and exploration.\n\nFor your dating situation, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Practice gratitude**: Make a conscious effort to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship. Write down three things you appreciate about your partner each day. This can help shift your attention away from what could be and towards what is.\n2. **Communicate openly**: Talk to your partner about your feelings and concerns. Be honest about your thoughts, but also be respectful of their feelings and boundaries. This can help you both understand each other better and work through any issues together.\n3. **Set realistic expectations**: Remind yourself that there's no such thing as a \"perfect\" partner or situation. Everyone has flaws, and it's up to you to decide what you're willing to work with. Focus on the things that are truly important to you, rather than constantly comparing your relationship to hypothetical scenarios.\n4. **Explore within the relationship**: Instead of constantly thinking about what could be, try to explore new experiences and activities with your partner. This can help you build a stronger connection and create memories together.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: When you catch yourself thinking about other girls or possibilities, acknowledge the thought and gently refocus on the present moment. Mindfulness can help you stay grounded and appreciative of what you have.\n\nAs for the \"what ifs\" in general, remember that:\n\n1. **Uncertainty is a natural part of life**: You'll never know for certain what could have been if you hadn't made a particular choice. Focus on what you can control and let go of the what-ifs.\n2. **Appreciate the journey**: Instead of dwelling on what could be, try to appreciate the journey you're on. Focus on the lessons you've learned, the experiences you've had, and the growth you've undergone.\n3. **Practice self-reflection**: Take time to reflect on your own values, goals, and priorities. This can help you understand what you truly want and need, making it easier to appreciate what you have.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it may take time to develop a greater sense of contentment.

    "sentence": "How to converse with intrusive people? We all know those people, the ones who have a litany of questions every time you talk to them. They want to know as much information about you as your spouse would and maybe more. And then they give you advice on all aspects of life, because they know everything. \n\nUsually I can handle these types of interactions with strangers very well. I don't value their opinion too much, so I freely speak my mind. However I have a few family members and coworkers that are like this and I'm not quite sure how to say \"back the f**k off\" without coming across as a total  B. Especially because the questions aren't necessarily outlandish, it's just the amount of them and constant inquiry. \n\nAny tips on how to handle these convos in a low-key realistic way? \n\nIf it makes a difference, I'm a 29F who looks closer to 20. Any assertion comes seems to come across as emotional or bitchy. Soooooo HALP! \n\nThanks in advance!",

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Dealing with overly curious and intrusive people can be draining and frustrating. Since you're looking for a low-key and realistic approach, I've got some tips that might help you navigate these conversations without coming across as emotional or bitchy.\n\n1. **Set boundaries without being confrontational**: When someone asks an invasive question, you can respond with a simple, \"I appreciate your interest, but I'd rather not discuss that right now.\" or \"I'm not comfortable sharing that information.\" This sets a clear boundary without being confrontational or aggressive.\n2. **Use humor to deflect**: If you're comfortable with it, you can use a lighthearted tone to deflect their questions. For example, \"Wow, you're really curious about my life, aren't you?\" or \"I'm starting to feel like I'm on a job interview!\" This can help shift the focus away from their invasive questions and create a more relaxed atmosphere.\n3. **Practice active listening**: When they're giving unsolicited advice, listen attentively and nod along. This shows that you value their input, but don't feel obligated to act on it. You can also respond with a simple, \"I appreciate your perspective, but I'm going to take some time to think about it\" or \"I'll definitely consider that.\"\n4. **Change the subject**: If the conversation is getting too intense or overwhelming, try to steer it towards a different topic. You can say, \"Speaking of [new topic], have you heard about [related news or event]?\" or \"I've been meaning to ask you about [related topic].\"\n5. **Avoid getting defensive**: It's natural to feel defensive when someone is being overly intrusive, but try not to take it personally. Remember that their behavior is often a reflection of their own insecurities or need for control. Stay calm and composed, and focus on maintaining a healthy boundary.\n6. **Use the 'gray rock' technique**: Imagine yourself as a gray rock in a river – you're not absorbing all the energy and emotions around you. Stay neutral, and don't let their words or emotions affect your mood or behavior.\n7. **Prioritize self-care**: Dealing with overly curious or intrusive people can be draining. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities, like exercise, meditation, or spending time with people who uplift and support you.\n\nAs for your concern about being perceived as emotional or bitchy, remember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being. You don't have to be confrontational or aggressive to set boundaries – a calm, assertive tone can be incredibly effective.\n\nLastly, since you're 29F and appear younger, you might want to consider the following: as you get older, you'll likely develop a stronger sense of self and a more confident tone. For now, focus on being kind, assertive, and respectful in your interactions, and people will be more likely to respect your boundaries.\n\nI hope these tips help you navigate those pesky conversations!"

    "sentence": "So my gf and I have dated for almost a year now. It's a good relationship and I have never caught her in a lie. And to be clear, I don't care about the past and how many bodies a girl has, as long as she is honest from the jump.\n\nVery early when we started dating, she told me her body count pretty early on (it was 3) and was very transparent about her past dating / sexual experiences really without me even asking or prodding. Mentioned that she hadn't dated for a whole year and a half before seeing me. Collectively, I found her confiding strange, because it's pretty sensitive information, and I found it weird that she felt so comfortable telling me her count without me even asking. She didn't even proceed to ask what mine was. I also just find it crazy because she is so extroverted and quite attractive...but only has a body count of 3 before me?\n\nAnyhow, there's some things that make me feel like things aren't adding up. First, she was very willing to get sexual early on when we started dating. She said she just really liked me and felt comfortable with me..but after not dating for a year and a half, I think it's crazy that she felt comfortable enough to invite me to her room on the second date. We had sex within a month I think.\n\nShe mentioned really liking a guy before me that she dated for a month, but he ghosted her. And she said they only ever kissed. She liked this guy so much, but they only kissed - while she invited me to her room on the second date? It just doesn't seem to add up.\n\nI don't want to assume she is lying, but is this peculiar? Or am I being paranoid? Everyone says that a girls lie about their body count, especially when it is below 5. Not sure what to think\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Gf was very transparent and open about her body count early on when we dated without me even asking. This and some other details seem peculiar and part of me thinks she could be lying. Not sure what to think overall. Am I being paranoid?",

While it's great that your girlfriend was open about her past, some of the details you've shared do raise some red flags.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to be more reserved about their past experiences, especially sensitive ones like sexual history. The fact that she was willing to share her body count so early on could be a sign of her comfort level with you, but it's also possible she was trying to establish trust or even test your boundaries.\n\nRegarding her willingness to get intimate early on, it's possible she was genuinely drawn to you and felt comfortable with you, but it's also possible she was trying to accelerate the relationship to avoid feelings of intimacy or attachment. The fact that she didn't ask about your past experiences and was only interested in sharing her own could be a sign of imbalance in the relationship.\n\nThe discrepancy between her stories about the guy she liked before you (only kissing) and her willingness to be intimate with you early on is indeed peculiar. It's possible she's not being entirely truthful, or maybe she's not even aware of her own motivations or feelings.\n\nIt's not necessarily about assuming she's lying, but rather being aware of the inconsistencies and having an open conversation about your concerns. You could try asking her about these specific instances and see how she responds. Approach the conversation with empathy and avoid accusatory language, focusing on your own feelings and concerns rather than making assumptions about her honesty.\n\nRemember that people can change, and it's possible she's grown or learned from her past experiences. However, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and ensure you're comfortable with the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nBefore making any major decisions, take some time to reflect on your feelings and consider having an open conversation with your girlfriend. It's better to address these concerns now rather than letting them simmer and potentially causing more harm in the long run."

I (31F) have been seeing this guy (28F) since January.\nWe live less than 2 hours away, so we meet on weekends.\nAround 3 months ago I asked the big question to this guy \"what are we?\". He said that I'm very special to him, that he cares a lot about me and pointed out what a valuable woman he thinks I am. But told me he's not ready for a relationship yet, saying he needs some time. That he wants to build a relationship with me in the future, but he just can't now. \nHe also said this has nothing to do with me. Told me he feels vulnerable when he thinks about a relationship and also because he feels he needs to work on himself first.\n He just had a serious relationship on his early 20's. It lasted 6 months and it was super toxic. \n\nWe are exclusive and do everything what a couple does. Sex is great, we have deep intimate conversations. We talk all day long and trust on each other. We have a lot of fun.\nBut I just can't understand why wouldn't he want a relationship with me if he actually cares about me the way he says he does.\n\nI'm confused.

I can see and feel he loves me, but at the same time it hurts me a lot the fact that we are not in the same page, meaning he doesn't wants me the way I want him.\n\nIt creates me a lot of insecurities too.

So you can continue on this plateau or you can tell him that you do want one so if he doesn't then you don't see a future with him and call it quits. Otherwise you're probably going be posting this exact same scenario a year from now with no progress.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and feelings. It's natural to be confused and hurt when someone you care about doesn't want to commit to a relationship. Let's break down the situation:\n\nHe's told you he's not ready for a relationship, but he cares about you deeply and values you as a person. He's also aware of his past toxic relationship and wants to work on himself before committing to another relationship. This suggests he's taking responsibility for his own growth and well-being.\n\nHowever, his hesitation might be rooted in his past experience. It's possible he's scared of getting hurt again or repeating patterns from his previous relationship. This fear might be holding him back from committing to you.\n\nIt's also important to consider that he's not saying he doesn't want to be with you; he's saying he's not ready for a relationship. This distinction is crucial. He might still want to continue seeing you and building a connection, but he's not ready to label it as a relationship.\n\nAs for your insecurities about him being willing to be with other women, it's natural to wonder. However, it's essential to remember that his hesitation to commit is likely due to his own personal issues, not because he's not interested in you. It's unfair to assume he's looking elsewhere when he's been open about his feelings for you.\n\nI wouldn't recommend waiting indefinitely for someone who's not ready to commit. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider what you want from this relationship. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you willing to wait for someone who's not ready to commit?\n2. Are you comfortable with the uncertainty and lack of clarity around your relationship status?\n3. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship, and are they being met in this situation?\n\nTake the time to reflect on your feelings and priorities. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and feelings. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and avoid accusatory language. This can help you both understand each other better and potentially clear up any misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship where both parties are on the same page and committed to each other. If that's not the case, it might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is truly right for you."
