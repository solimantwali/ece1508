I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. \n\nAnyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck.

Approach this by seeking a therapist (not a marriage therapist- one just for you, to overcome your problem) so he can see that you acknowledge his feelings, and also for your sake as a person. \n\nI would also advise to move to another room in the house to further reiterate you're serious about changing. Your mere presence probably makes him uneasy,  and this way he can have room to feel more like himself. It shows respect and consideration,  which is a form of love.\n\nThroughout the process, remember he doesn't owe you anything. Not forgiveness, or even kindness. He's pissed off as hell- let him be. Be patient, be kind, listen well. Whenever you feel like you're about to take a step back in progress,  excuse yourself from the room to deal with your feelings. \n\nGood luck saving your marriage.\n\nSource: Domestic Violence survivor of a male - female relationship.

He's hoping to become a teacher and is currently working as a substitute. We've been dating for almost three years after meeting in college, but when I stumbled upon something that I bought to his attention, he made me out to be the enemy while accusing me of \"not being on his side\"\n\nEric is involved in a few role-play groups on Twitter, and he has a few accounts that portray various fictional characters. He's also into D&amp;D, but writing stories for his RP group to act out is his hobby, and while I'm not a part of the group, I followed some of the accounts to keep up with his storylines, and he sometimes asks me for opinions on his stories. However, I stumbled upon an account that I wasn't supposed to find, but did because some of his RP accounts followed it (as many of his accounts follow each other), and it was an account that impersonated one of his friends. Long story short... there's a guy named Evan who is in his D&amp;D group, and Evan is one of his closest friends. Evan also has a younger brother (Todd) who sometimes tags along to D&amp;D, and he is a talented artist who has drawn many of Eric's characters and profile photos for his RP accounts too. And while I'm not an active member of D&amp;D, I've met him a few times when I've tagged along on days when Eric would invite me\n\nEvan and Todd come from a military family where both of their parents served, but Evan went to college. Todd wanted to go into the service upon finishing high school, but Eric would try to convince him to go to college because he believed it was better than the service. However, Todd still wanted to enter. So, Eric spoke to Evan to try and get him on his side, but Evan reinforced that the choice was ultimately Todd's and that there are benefits to both the military and college. So, neither would be a bad choice, and I agreed with that too. However, when an injury would prevent Todd from being able to enter, Eric believed that he would opt for college, but he landed an internship through a connection with his father that would allow him to learn a trade instead, and that is what led to what happened recently\n\nEric made a Twitter that impersonated Todd, but unlike his RP accounts, he actually made it look like Todd's actual account and began using it to make fun of him. He downloaded photos of Todd and used them to make memes that degraded him for not going to college, some calling him \"stupid\" and \"how he got what he deserved\" by suffering the injury and not being able to enter, but he didn't stop there. He also downloaded photos from the accounts of family/relatives and began making fun of them for the internship he landed, posting photos of people who weren't Todd too. When I told him what I found and asked why he felt he could do this, he said that \"everyone sucks up to military families\" and that they're \"probably poor enough to get free college\" which is \"better than an internship\". When I pointed out a meme where he called Todd \"mentally re\\_\\_\\_\\_ted\", he said it was \"true\" because they were \"stupid to refuse college\" and \"think they're better than it\". When I told him that he has no right to berate Todd and a bunch of people related to him, he refused to take it down and said it's \"better than exploding in Todd's face\" when it really bothers him as someone who has a master's in teaching and wants everyone to know how important school is. But, when I told him that Todd is entitled to his own opinion, he accused me of \"taking Todd's side\" and \"not being sensitive of his ADHD\" and how he uses Twitter to vent when he's \"unable to focus\" which allows him to \"be more even keel in public\". When I asked if he had done this to anyone else besides Todd, he told me to \"mind my own business\" and refused to take it down. He also said that he had \"done this for a while\" and that only now I had an issue with it, and the account about Todd was a few weeks old\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter we talked that night, I planned to tell him that I wanted a break, but I didn't want to say it without preparing for him to potentially do the same to me on Twitter. So, after taking the advice of a lot of people, I decided to tell my family and relatives about how he had gone on a rampage of downloading photos of Todd's family/relatives and advised them to make their accounts private or block him, and a lot of them were really thankful that I told them. The main reason I did was because Eric downloaded photos of minors who were related to Todd, and I didn't want him doing the same to my family and making memes out of uninvolved people. I also spoke to Evan and told/showed him what had happened, and he was really upset and said that he and his parents were going to call the school Eric's interning/subbing at and let them know of what he's been doing not only to Todd, but also to minors in their family who he downloaded images of. He also said that he and his parents went to the police to address it, but as of writing, the account of Todd that Eric made is still somehow up and not yet deleted, and maybe it's because Eric made the account private after our initial conversation, but I don't know. I gave them all of my screenshots, but as of now, nothing has happened. Evan's parents also told/showed the school what happened, but he is still employed and subbing at the moment, and Evan said that they were having a hard time proving the account was Eric's although they are still trying to get it taken down. He also has relatives who are complaining to the school too about photos Eric downloaded of them and their children, but almost a month later, nothing has happened yet\n\nAfter talking to Evan and my family, I told Eric that we were done, but he began making posts about me on one of his RP accounts and how I was apparently \"cheating on him\" and \"trying to start rumors\", and I screenshotted what he posted, but still nothing has happened. He also started posting about some prescriptions I've taken that I never told anyone besides family, but my relatives have been supportive throughout. But, I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt. He's also started posting memes about me too, and I have record of all of it, and I'm hoping that with time and all of the people/relatives reporting that something can happen soon, but I'm slightly surprised nothing has happened yet. Lastly, I want to say that this whole thing has shown a side of him that I've never really seen before. Like, we've argued. But, stumbling across this account and what he \"uses to vent and cope with ADHD\" just made him so aggressive because he said that it was \"as if I was removing an inhaler from someone who needs it\" when we talked that night and he got so defensive. That's what he compared it too, me \"making fun of people with special needs\" as he's also posted about, and that's where I am now. I feel like I've done almost as much as I can, and waiting is hard. So, if anyone has any advice on how to push through this time with an ex who's trying to destroy everyone I know, I would really appreciate it. But, it's hard right now, and I'll end with this. He's also gone about posting images of me too, but nothing explicit as we've never taken those. However, he's started posting photos of me when I was in high school and in dance and making degrading comments about my body, and I've taken screenshots of those to the police too as I'm still waiting to see what happens. I've been told that it can be a process, but that has hurt the most and is what I'm trying to push through, and if anyone has any advice on how to just get past a toxic ex who goes to such measures, I would really appreciate it because right now is really hard. I'm hoping something happens soon, but maybe it's just a process, but I could just use all of the advice I could get\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: After our initial conversation where I confronted him on what I found, I wanted to break up, but not immediately until I got some things in order after many of the helpful comments from the first post, and I decided to warn family/relatives to block him or make their accounts private, but he's started posting about me in the same way he did to Todd",

He is currently a sergeant, and Eric is proud of him, but he doesn't know much about his military career because he doesn't have much time to ask. When I met him, he was on his first deployment, but he came back for a few weeks and we had dinner together once. He's a very nice guy who is quite chatty, but he's also very quiet about his military experiences, and I didn't know how to bring it up. When I met him again, he was back from his deployment, but he was quite reserved, and I didn't have much time to talk to him\n\nDuring a dinner I attended with Eric, he mentioned to me that he was looking for someone to draw some fan art for his RP group, and I thought that maybe Todd would be interested in drawing some. I asked him if he knew if Todd was interested, and he said no, but he would ask him. The next day, he asked Todd, and Todd said yes, but only if Eric was going to be the one to ask me. I was a bit confused by that, but I thought that maybe Todd was looking for a way to ask me to draw some fan art, so I agreed, and Eric asked me to send some art to Todd. However, after I sent it, Todd sent me a message asking me why I did it, and I told him that I did it because Eric asked me to. He then told me that he didn't ask me to, and that I should have only done it if he asked me directly, and that I should stop doing stuff for Eric behind his back. He then sent me a link to an Instagram post that Eric had made, where Eric was talking about me doing his fan art, and he was mad because I had shared the post, which made him look like an ass. I was confused by this because I never shared the post, but Todd claimed that I did, and I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't want to listen, and he blocked me. I didn't understand why he was so mad, but I was mad at him too because I felt that he was being unfair, so I blocked him as well\n\nAfter that, Eric was upset with me, and he told me that I was not on his side, and that I was sabotaging his friendship with Todd. He told me that Todd was his closest friend, and that I shouldn't have done what I did, and that I should have asked him before doing something for Todd. He told me that he didn't want to see me around Todd anymore, and that I should stay away from him. I was shocked by his reaction, and I asked him what I did wrong, and he told me that I was not a part of their group, and that I shouldn't have done anything behind his back. He told me that he trusted me, and that I shouldn't have betrayed his trust like that. I was confused by this because I didn't do anything wrong, and I felt that he was being unfair. I tried to explain to him what happened, but he didn't want to listen, and he got angry with me. He told me that he didn't want to see me anymore, and that I should leave him alone. I was very hurt by this, but I didn't want to argue with him anymore, so I left him alone\n\nI was sad and upset by this, and I felt that I had been unfairly treated by Eric. I thought that he was being unfair and that he was not on my side. I was confused by why he was being so angry with me, and I felt that I didn't do anything wrong. I felt that he was trying to make me look bad and that he was trying to sabotage my friendship with Todd. I didn't know what to do, so I went to talk to my best friend and confidant, and she told me to try to talk to Eric again and try to figure out what was going on. She told me to tell him that I didn't do anything wrong and that I was only trying to help him out, and that I didn't want to argue with him anymore. She told me that maybe he was going through a tough time, and maybe he needed some time to think about things. I decided to talk to Eric again, and I told him that I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was only trying to help him out, and that I didn't want to argue with him anymore.

He listened to me, and I apologized for whatever I did wrong, and he apologized for being mad at me, and he told me that he was sorry for being unfair to me. He told me that he was glad that I was on his side, and he asked me to forgive him. I forg"
