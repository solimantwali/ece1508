    "human_response": "Happiness is created, NOT found.  Make it.  You can't wait until happiness falls on your lap, because you'll end up waiting forever.\n\nIf you lack drive and such, then find a goal, plan how to achieve that goal, and execute the plan.  Keep doing this, and soon you'll realize these small wins and achievements make you a better person, AND make you happier with yourself.\n\nAnd NO, video game achievements and trophies don't count.",
    "model_response": "I'm glad you're willing to acknowledge and explore this feeling! It's normal to have ups and downs in life, and it's great that you're taking the first step towards addressing it.\n\nBeing unhappy with yourself can stem from various reasons, but since you mentioned lacking drive and determination, I'll focus on that aspect. Here are some suggestions to help you cultivate happiness and motivation:\n\n1. **Identify your values and priorities**: Reflect on what's truly important to you. What are your non-negotiables? What brings you joy and fulfillment? When you're aligned with your values, you'll feel more purposeful and motivated.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, just as you would to a close friend. Acknowledge that it's okay to have off days and that you're doing the best you can. Treat yourself with understanding and patience.\n3. **Set small, achievable goals**: Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This will help build momentum and confidence.\n4. **Find activities that spark joy**: Engage in activities that bring you pleasure and make you feel good. This could be reading, exercise, creative pursuits, or spending time with loved ones. Make time for these activities regularly.\n5. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth. Focus on learning and improvement rather than perfection.\n6. **Get enough sleep and self-care**: Prioritize rest and self-care. A well-rested and nourished body and mind are more likely to feel motivated and happy.\n7. **Seek accountability and support**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend or mentor. Having someone to hold you accountable and offer guidance can be a great motivator.\n8. **Practice mindfulness and gratitude**: Focus on the present moment and acknowledge the good things in your life. Gratitude can help shift your perspective and increase happiness.\n9. **Take breaks and allow yourself to relax**: It's essential to recharge and give yourself permission to take time off when needed. A clear mind and a sense of calm can help you approach challenges with more enthusiasm.\n10. **Re-evaluate your environment**: Sometimes, our surroundings can affect our mood and motivation. Consider making changes to your workspace, social circle, or living situation to better align with your values and goals.\n\nRemember, happiness and motivation are like muscles that need to be exercised regularly. Start with small, consistent efforts, and be patient with yourself as you work through this process.\n\nWhat resonates with you the most, or is there anything specific you'd like to focus on first?",

    "model_response": "I'm happy to help you weigh the pros and cons.\n\nAs an atheist, it's natural to have concerns about dating someone who believes in God, especially when it comes to raising children. Here's what some fellow atheists had to say:\n\n* Some said they wouldn't date someone who believes in God because they value their own non-belief and don't want to compromise on that. They'd rather find someone who shares their worldview.\n* Others said they wouldn't mind dating someone who believes in God, as long as the person is respectful of their non-belief and doesn't try to convert them. They'd focus on building a strong connection and communication.\n* A few mentioned that they'd consider dating someone who believes in God if the person is open to exploring their doubts and questions, and is willing to have open and honest discussions about their beliefs.\n\nRegarding coparenting, some key boundaries to consider:\n\n* You might want to discuss how you'll approach religious education or lack thereof for your kids. You could agree to not raise them in any specific religion, or explore alternative spiritual practices that align with your values.\n* You might need to establish clear guidelines for how you'll address religious or spiritual topics in your household. For example, you could decide to focus on secular values and ethics instead of religious ones.\n* You might want to discuss how you'll handle situations where your partner's beliefs conflict with your own. For instance, if your partner wants to take your kids to church, you might need to set boundaries around what they're exposed to or how often.\n\nIn your case, since you've only had one date, it's hard to say for sure whether this person is worth continuing to pursue. However, it's great that you're thinking critically about the potential challenges and considering what you want for your future together.\n\nIf you do decide to continue dating, I'd recommend having an open and honest conversation about your concerns and boundaries. You might ask questions like:\n\n* How do you envision your relationship and coparenting style?\n* How do you think your beliefs will influence your parenting decisions?\n* Are you open to discussing and exploring doubts or questions about your faith?\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own values and beliefs in a relationship. If you're not comfortable with the idea of dating someone who believes in God, it's perfectly fine to acknowledge that and move on. But if you do decide to pursue this person, being open and communicative can help you build a stronger connection and navigate potential challenges.",

    "sentence": "How to stop being an emotional abuser My marriage is on the verge of ending, and I know it's my fault. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. \n\nAnyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck. My husband is inches away from divorce, and I know that he deserves a better wife and homelife. How do I stop? Especially since I didn't know I was doing it. \n\nPlease help!",
    "human_response": "First step is responsibility. Remember that it doesn't matter that you didn't know you were doing it,  or how bad it makes you feel to be an abuser. Don't burden him by asking him to forgive you,  he has been through enough. \n\nHe probably feels disrespected, unimportant, and unloved. Approach this by seeking a therapist (not a marriage therapist- one just for you, to overcome your problem) so he can see that you acknowledge his feelings, and also for your sake as a person. \n\nI would also advise to move to another room in the house to further reiterate you're serious about changing. Your mere presence probably makes him uneasy,  and this way he can have room to feel more like himself. It shows respect and consideration,  which is a form of love.\n\nThroughout the process, remember he doesn't owe you anything. Not forgiveness, or even kindness. He's pissed off as hell- let him be. Be patient, be kind, listen well. Whenever you feel like you're about to take a step back in progress,  excuse yourself from the room to deal with your feelings. \n\nGood luck saving your marriage.\n\nSource: Domestic Violence survivor of a male - female relationship.

    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with emotional abuse in your marriage. It's not easy to acknowledge and confront our own flaws, especially when it's deeply ingrained. First, please know that you're not alone, and many people struggle with this issue. It's a process to change, but it's not impossible.\n\nSince you're aware of your actions and willing to change, that's a huge step forward. Here are some steps to help you stop emotional abuse and work towards a healthier marriage:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and accept responsibility**: Recognize that your actions have hurt your husband and children. It's essential to own your mistakes and take responsibility for your behavior.\n2. **Seek professional help**: Consult a therapist or counselor who specializes in relationship issues and emotional abuse. They'll help you identify the root causes of your behavior and develop strategies to change.\n3. **Learn about emotional abuse**: Continue to educate yourself on the signs, effects, and patterns of emotional abuse. This will help you understand your actions and how they've impacted your husband and children.\n4. **Practice self-reflection**: Regularly take time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Identify triggers that lead to emotional outbursts and work on developing healthier coping mechanisms.\n5. **Work on empathy**: Put yourself in your husband's shoes and try to understand how your behavior has affected him. Practice active listening and validation to improve communication.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries for yourself to prevent relapsing into old patterns. This might mean avoiding certain situations or people that trigger negative emotions.\n7. **Rebuild trust**: Rebuilding trust takes time and effort. Be patient, consistent, and genuine in your efforts to change. Your husband may need time to heal and rebuild trust as well.\n8. **Seek support**: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who encourage and motivate you to change. This could include friends, family, or online support groups.\n9. **Focus on self-care**: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. This will help you cope with the stress and anxiety that comes with changing your behavior.\n10. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that you're not a bad person, and you're capable of change. Forgive yourself for your past actions and focus on moving forward.\n\nRemember, healing and change take time. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work through this process. It's not easy, but it's worth it to create a healthier, happier marriage.\n\nRegarding your husband's desire for divorce, it's essential to respect his feelings and boundaries. If he's willing to work on the relationship, you can start by having open and honest conversations about your progress and goals. If he's not interested in reconciliation, it may be best to prioritize your own healing and well-being.\n\nPlease take care of yourself during this challenging time.",

    "model_response": "That can be frustrating! It's understandable that you're looking for some direction on how to handle this situation.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with decision-making, especially when it comes to their goals and aspirations. It's possible that your girlfriend is going through a phase of self-discovery or is simply feeling overwhelmed.\n\nHere are a few suggestions on how you can approach this situation:\n\n1. **Have an open and honest conversation**: Talk to your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you value your time together and would like to do activities that bring you both joy. Ask her if she's feeling overwhelmed or unsure about what she wants to do. This conversation can help her feel heard and understood, and might even prompt her to reflect on her own desires.\n2. **Explore her interests together**: Instead of presenting her with a list of activities, ask her about things she's been interested in or enjoyed in the past. You could also try doing something together that you know she's never tried before, which might spark a new interest.\n3. **Encourage self-reflection**: Suggest that she take some time to reflect on what she wants to achieve or accomplish in the short-term and long-term. This can help her gain clarity on her goals and values. You can even offer to help her brainstorm or set goals together.\n4. **Compromise and flexibility**: Be willing to compromise and be flexible. If she's not interested in doing something specific, suggest an alternative or find a middle ground. This can help you both find a solution that works for both of you.\n5. **Re-evaluate the relationship**: If this pattern persists and you feel like you're always having to take the lead or make all the decisions, it may be worth having a deeper conversation about the dynamics of your relationship. It's essential to ensure that you're both on the same page and that the relationship is balanced.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Avoid being too critical or judgmental, as this can create more tension and make the situation worse. By being patient, supportive, and open-minded, you can help your girlfriend find her way and strengthen your relationship.",

He's hoping to become a teacher and is currently working as a substitute. We've been dating for almost three years after meeting in college, but when I stumbled upon something that I bought to his attention, he made me out to be the enemy while accusing me of \"not being on his side\"\n\nEric is involved in a few role-play groups on Twitter, and he has a few accounts that portray various fictional characters. He's also into D&amp;D, but writing stories for his RP group to act out is his hobby, and while I'm not a part of the group, I followed some of the accounts to keep up with his storylines, and he sometimes asks me for opinions on his stories. However, I stumbled upon an account that I wasn't supposed to find, but did because some of his RP accounts followed it (as many of his accounts follow each other), and it was an account that impersonated one of his friends. Long story short... there's a guy named Evan who is in his D&amp;D group, and Evan is one of his closest friends. Evan also has a younger brother (Todd) who sometimes tags along to D&amp;D, and he is a talented artist who has drawn many of Eric's characters and profile photos for his RP accounts too. And while I'm not an active member of D&amp;D, I've met him a few times when I've tagged along on days when Eric would invite me\n\nEvan and Todd come from a military family where both of their parents served, but Evan went to college. Todd wanted to go into the service upon finishing high school, but Eric would try to convince him to go to college because he believed it was better than the service. However, Todd still wanted to enter. So, Eric spoke to Evan to try and get him on his side, but Evan reinforced that the choice was ultimately Todd's and that there are benefits to both the military and college. So, neither would be a bad choice, and I agreed with that too. However, when an injury would prevent Todd from being able to enter, Eric believed that he would opt for college, but he landed an internship through a connection with his father that would allow him to learn a trade instead, and that is what led to what happened recently\n\nEric made a Twitter that impersonated Todd, but unlike his RP accounts, he actually made it look like Todd's actual account and began using it to make fun of him. He downloaded photos of Todd and used them to make memes that degraded him for not going to college, some calling him \"stupid\" and \"how he got what he deserved\" by suffering the injury and not being able to enter, but he didn't stop there. He also downloaded photos from the accounts of family/relatives and began making fun of them for the internship he landed, posting photos of people who weren't Todd too. When I told him what I found and asked why he felt he could do this, he said that \"everyone sucks up to military families\" and that they're \"probably poor enough to get free college\" which is \"better than an internship\". When I pointed out a meme where he called Todd \"mentally re\\_\\_\\_\\_ted\", he said it was \"true\" because they were \"stupid to refuse college\" and \"think they're better than it\". When I told him that he has no right to berate Todd and a bunch of people related to him, he refused to take it down and said it's \"better than exploding in Todd's face\" when it really bothers him as someone who has a master's in teaching and wants everyone to know how important school is. But, when I told him that Todd is entitled to his own opinion, he accused me of \"taking Todd's side\" and \"not being sensitive of his ADHD\" and how he uses Twitter to vent when he's \"unable to focus\" which allows him to \"be more even keel in public\". When I asked if he had done this to anyone else besides Todd, he told me to \"mind my own business\" and refused to take it down. He also said that he had \"done this for a while\" and that only now I had an issue with it, and the account about Todd was a few weeks old\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter we talked that night, I planned to tell him that I wanted a break, but I didn't want to say it without preparing for him to potentially do the same to me on Twitter. So, after taking the advice of a lot of people, I decided to tell my family and relatives about how he had gone on a rampage of downloading photos of Todd's family/relatives and advised them to make their accounts private or block him, and a lot of them were really thankful that I told them. The main reason I did was because Eric downloaded photos of minors who were related to Todd, and I didn't want him doing the same to my family and making memes out of uninvolved people. I also spoke to Evan and told/showed him what had happened, and he was really upset and said that he and his parents were going to call the school Eric's interning/subbing at and let them know of what he's been doing not only to Todd, but also to minors in their family who he downloaded images of. He also said that he and his parents went to the police to address it, but as of writing, the account of Todd that Eric made is still somehow up and not yet deleted, and maybe it's because Eric made the account private after our initial conversation, but I don't know. I gave them all of my screenshots, but as of now, nothing has happened. Evan's parents also told/showed the school what happened, but he is still employed and subbing at the moment, and Evan said that they were having a hard time proving the account was Eric's although they are still trying to get it taken down. He also has relatives who are complaining to the school too about photos Eric downloaded of them and their children, but almost a month later, nothing has happened yet\n\nAfter talking to Evan and my family, I told Eric that we were done, but he began making posts about me on one of his RP accounts and how I was apparently \"cheating on him\" and \"trying to start rumors\", and I screenshotted what he posted, but still nothing has happened. He also started posting about some prescriptions I've taken that I never told anyone besides family, but my relatives have been supportive throughout. But, I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt. He's also started posting memes about me too, and I have record of all of it, and I'm hoping that with time and all of the people/relatives reporting that something can happen soon, but I'm slightly surprised nothing has happened yet. Lastly, I want to say that this whole thing has shown a side of him that I've never really seen before. Like, we've argued. But, stumbling across this account and what he \"uses to vent and cope with ADHD\" just made him so aggressive because he said that it was \"as if I was removing an inhaler from someone who needs it\" when we talked that night and he got so defensive. That's what he compared it too, me \"making fun of people with special needs\" as he's also posted about, and that's where I am now. I feel like I've done almost as much as I can, and waiting is hard. So, if anyone has any advice on how to push through this time with an ex who's trying to destroy everyone I know, I would really appreciate it. But, it's hard right now, and I'll end with this. He's also gone about posting images of me too, but nothing explicit as we've never taken those. However, he's started posting photos of me when I was in high school and in dance and making degrading comments about my body, and I've taken screenshots of those to the police too as I'm still waiting to see what happens. I've been told that it can be a process, but that has hurt the most and is what I'm trying to push through, and if anyone has any advice on how to just get past a toxic ex who goes to such measures, I would really appreciate it because right now is really hard. I'm hoping something happens soon, but maybe it's just a process, but I could just use all of the advice I could get\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: After our initial conversation where I confronted him on what I found, I wanted to break up, but not immediately until I got some things in order after many of the helpful comments from the first post, and I decided to warn family/relatives to block him or make their accounts private, but he's started posting about me in the same way he did to Todd",
    "human_response": "What a horrible person he is! You have an amazing amount of strength to be able to stand up to that nonsense!

    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt, frustrated, and concerned about the situation. Here are some thoughts that might help you navigate this challenging time:\n\n1. **Take care of yourself**: It's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being during this period. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n2. **Document everything**: You've already done an excellent job of keeping records of the screenshots and conversations. Continue to do so, as this will be crucial evidence if you need to take further action.\n3. **Support system**: Surround yourself with loved ones who care about you and are supportive. Having a strong network of friends and family can help you feel less isolated and more empowered to deal with the situation.\n4. **Don't engage**: Try to avoid engaging with Eric's posts or responding to his messages. This can escalate the situation and give him the attention he's seeking. Instead, focus on moving forward and taking care of yourself.\n5. **Consider a restraining order**: If Eric's behavior is becoming increasingly harassing or threatening, you may want to consider obtaining a restraining order to protect yourself.\n6. **Block and report**: Make sure to block Eric on all social media platforms and report his accounts for violating terms of service. This will help limit his ability to harass you and others.\n7. **Focus on the future**: While it's natural to feel angry and hurt, try to focus on your own growth and well-being. Think about what you want to achieve in the future and work towards those goals.\n8. **Seek professional help**: If you're struggling to cope with the emotional impact of this situation, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support as you navigate this challenging time.\n9. **Remember, you're not alone**: Many people have gone through similar experiences and have come out stronger on the other side. You are not alone, and there are resources available to help you.\n10. **Take things one step at a time**: It's essential to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to \"get over\" the situation quickly. Allow yourself to process your emotions and take the time you need to heal.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. You don't deserve to be harassed or bullied by someone who is supposed to care about you. Keep in mind that it's not your fault, and you're not responsible for Eric's behavior.",

    "sentence": "I've (25F) been dating my partner (26M) for around 9 months. He has been my first romantic relationship.\n\nWe've  been having conversations around sex for a couple of weeks, he seemed  very keen and like he was looking forward to it. I've been initiating  the discussions, because I asked him to take it slow, and I grew up in a  not very physically affectionate household, and it's been a learning  experience to allow myself to enjoy romantic attention in that way. But  we talked about how we have a similar view of sex, not interested in  casual sex and wanting emotional connection as a key part of it, which  we both felt like we had and were ready for sex.\n\nSo  yesterday we were hanging out and he told me that he was very attracted  to me in that moment and had an erection, and so I asked him if he  wanted to go to the bedroom, and he said yes, but didn't move. So I  checked in, and told him we didn't have to have sex if he didn't want  to, but he said he did. Before we had sex, I opened up and told him it  was my first time, and that I wanted him to take it slow and him take  the lead a bit. We started having sex, and he was silent with no  checking of consent, quite rough, and not as caring or affectionate as I  would have hoped, even when I tried to tell him what I liked, he didn't  listen, and it just felt really mechanical.\n\nAs  soon as he was done, his head hit the pillow and he said \"Oh, here's  something I haven't mentioned yet, I'm asexual I think, but I really  don't know for sure\". This shocked me because he specifically told me he  wasn't, he just preferred sex in relationships and with partners. I  asked him about it a little more, and he said \"I could go our whole  relationship without having sex, I don't really like it or care about it, and my maximum amount of sex would be once every week or even every  fortnight, because I know you want it\".\n\nI said to him that my minimum was at least once a week, and I thought  that this was a pretty significant issue that we'd need to talk about  more, because I don't want to feel like I'm forcing him to have sex for  my sake. He then asked me how I felt if \"we never had sex at all?\", and  \"how would you have felt if we didn't have sex tonight?\". I said I was  looking forward to it, but of course he could say no at any time, and he  seemed to understand, but said he didn't really know what he wanted.\n\nBut  I went home and started thinking about the conversation, feeling like he wasn't 100% truthful in giving consent that he wanted sex, especially now knowing he is asexual, and him trying to gauge if he would have  ruined things by saying no. So I called him today, basically saying that  I was upset that he withheld his asexuality identity before sex, when I  had opened up a vulnerable dialogue right before telling him that I was  a virgin, and that he didn't give me the opportunity to make up my mind  to have sex with someone that didn't really care whether it happened or  not.\n\nI asked him point blank did  he really want to have sex with me, and he said \"yes\", and I called him  out on the mixed messages, and asked him again to be 100% truthful,  when he finally said, \"No, I didn't want to have sex with you\". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that my first experience wasn't consensual and he didn't want to be there, and I don't know how to process or handle this.\n\nI  basically told him I needed space to think and process this experience,  and that he needed to go and think about what he actually wants,  whether he sees any sex life with me at all, and how he can communicate  clearly about when he wants it or when he doesn't. But I feel like  there's been a huge violation of trust, and I don't know if I can trust him to give me genuine consent, or if he's giving me consent to keep the  peace.\n\nI guess I'm wondering  whether this relationship is salvageable, and how other people manage  being in a relationship with an asexual partner and a partner with a high libido?\n\nTL;DR - My boyfriend admitted that he was asexual after taking my virginity, told me he doesn't like sex, and didn't even want to have sex with me and he lied and told me that he did.\n\nThank you for your advice, I'm really hurt and confused and struggling to think straight!",
    "human_response": "The issue is much more strongly a lack of honest communication from one side of the relationship. How can you trust in the future what he's telling you about sex if he wasn't honest this time? So even if you're able to make an arrangement based on your needs and his supposed asexuality, can you believe and trust that it is a true, consensual, thought out communicated position. Your relationship has trust issues because he did not treat communication properly.",

The fact that your partner didn't disclose his asexuality before sex, and then proceeded to have sex with you without being genuinely interested in it, is a significant breach of trust.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your partner's asexuality is not your fault, and it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" him or make him more interested in sex. However, it's essential to have open and honest communication about your needs and desires in the relationship.\n\nAs for whether the relationship is salvageable, it ultimately depends on how you and your partner choose to move forward. If your partner is willing to work on being more honest and transparent about his feelings and desires, and if you feel comfortable having open and honest conversations about your needs, then it might be possible to rebuild trust and work through this issue.\n\nHowever, if your partner is unwilling to be honest with you and prioritize your feelings and desires, then it may be difficult to move forward in the relationship.\n\nRegarding being in a relationship with an asexual partner and a partner with a high libido, it can be challenging, but it's not impossible. It's essential to have open and honest communication about your needs and desires, and to find ways to compromise and find solutions that work for both partners.\n\nHere are some suggestions for moving forward:\n\n1. Take time to process your feelings and emotions. It's essential to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself space to heal and reflect on the experience.\n2. Have a calm and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns. It's essential to express your needs and desires clearly and assertively, and to listen to your partner's perspective as well.\n3. Consider couples therapy to work through the issues and find ways to communicate more effectively.\n4. Prioritize self-care and prioritize your own emotional and physical well-being.\n5. Consider whether you're willing to continue the relationship and work through the challenges, or if you need to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy and fulfilling for you.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect, care, and honesty in your relationships. It's essential to prioritize your own feelings and needs, and to seek support and guidance when needed.",

It's great that you're considering the bigger picture and acknowledging your partner's feelings.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your partner's reaction is valid, even if you don't agree with their perspective.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that his feelings and concerns are not necessarily rational or based solely on the probability of pregnancy.\n\nWhen communicating with your partner, it might be helpful to acknowledge his feelings and validate his concerns. You could say something like:\n\n\"I understand why you're upset, and I apologize for not telling you about missing the placebo pill. I know it's a big deal for you, and I respect that. However, I want to remind you of our previous conversations about my birth control methods and our consistent use of condoms. I understand that it's a placebo pill, but I know it's important to you that I'm honest with you.

I'm committed to being more open and honest with you about my birth control decisions going forward.

He would oscillate between extremely sweet in an overbearing way, calling me pet names and using a sweet voice, lots of hugging etc. to blowing up at a moment\u2019s notice. I never knew when it was going to happen or what would cause it. When I was a preteen / teen it might be a \u201ctone\u201d I had in my voice, he would scream and swear at me and call me a fucking brat until I cried. When I was a little kid (3 or 4) I once called 9-1-1 on a dare from my sister. It didn\u2019t even ring, I hung up out of fear, he found out and came in and screamed at me at the top of his lungs and I cried the entire day. He would threaten to hit me sometimes but never did, although I did get spanked as a child. One time when I was 3 or so I cut a little piece of my sister\u2019s hair off (she told me to) and he screamed and threatened to \u201cshave my whole fucking head\u201d etc. He was alcoholic for a while during the recession and picked us up from school events while drinking in the car. My sister threatened to tell and he yelled at us and told us not to \u201cthrow him under the bus\u201d.\n\nThen when he was nice again he would touch my arm or something and I\u2019d recoil, and he\u2019d ask what was wrong with me, I was his daughter, he had a right and so on. He said he loved me and wanted to spend time with me but because I was afraid of him snapping I\u2019d hide in my room and lock the door. He\u2019d threaten to take the door off the hinges (he didn\u2019t, but he would angrily shake it and bang on it if he saw it was locked). Lots of other stuff too, like him insulting and screaming at me for not believing everything he did (he thinks global warming is a hoax, voted for Trump, is racist and homophobic), he was drunk and high on my birthdays, but I could just keep going on.\n\nI went back for Christmas this year mostly out of guilt and for the first time ever he was strangely fine. No screaming, no insults, no excessive drinking, and he didn\u2019t bring up politics. No guilt tripping when I didn\u2019t want him touching me. He\u2019s been in therapy and is working on himself. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s better, but I still am really suspicious and I can\u2019t forgive everything he\u2019s done. He\u2019s never made those apologies himself or brought up how he treated us. He thinks he was the \u201cbest dad ever\u201d and that\u2019s why my sister and I got straight As and went to amazing schools (it was because we worked our asses off to get out of their house.) I succeeded with no thanks to my parents. They try to make me feel indebted because they \u201cfed me and put a roof over my head\u201d when there are \u201cchildren in Africa dying.\u201d I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive my dad (or my mom for enabling him - she\u2019s not a good person either). I think he\u2019s a narcissist and while I\u2019m really shocked the therapy seems to be working, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forgive him and I\u2019m not sure if I want to. I feel guilty for not wanting to forgive him. I never really sat down and told him everything I feel and think, but I don\u2019t want to. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to - it\u2019s very clear he was not good to me or my sister. I\u2019m low contact but also considering going no contact because I feel it would relieve a burden for me. Should I want to try? Just looking for advice on how to navigate my feelings here.\n\nTLDR; my dad was abusive in the past and is in therapy and has been better for several months, but I don\u2019t want to forgive him, and am considering going no contact.\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people are asking - I have been in therapy in the past and am looking for a new therapist now due to coverage changes.

However, it's crucial to recognize that his actions and words alone are not enough to erase the harm he caused. Forgiveness is a complex and personal process, and it's not something that can be forced or expected of you.\n\nGiven your feelings, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being. If being in low contact with your father is currently manageable for you, it might be a good idea to continue that arrangement. If, however, you're feeling overwhelmed or burdened by the relationship, going no contact might be the best decision for you.\n\nBefore making a decision, consider the following:\n\n1. Reflect on your reasons for staying in low contact or considering no contact. Is it to protect yourself from potential triggers or to avoid dealing with your feelings? Are you doing it out of a sense of obligation or guilt?\n2. Consider seeking support from a therapist or trusted friend/family member to help you process your emotions and work through your feelings about your father.\n3. Remember that forgiveness is not a one-time event, but a process. You might need time, space, and support to work through your emotions and come to a place of acceptance or forgiveness, if that's something you choose to pursue.\n4. Keep in mind that your father's actions and words alone are not a reflection of your worth or deservingness of love and respect. You are worthy of love and respect regardless of his behavior.\n\nRemember, your well-being is paramount. Take the time you need to prioritize your own healing and self-care.",

    "sentence": "My [30sF] neighbor is a young man in his early 20s. He is autistic, quite high-functioning. Lives with his dad and I believe his grandma and siblings. Sweet guy, knowledgeable on lots of subjects. He is very talkative, so it's often difficult to exit a conversation when I need to, but overall he's a pleasant guy who really enjoys socializing. I have learned the best ways to set conversational boundaries kindly but clearly, and we get along fine.\n\nI am a very introverted person. I need a LOT of quiet time to stay sane. I am a stay-at-home parent (we have a 3-year-old) so quiet and solitude is a blessed rarity around our house.\n\nIn the warmer months, we (my husband [30sM], our son, and myself) spend a ton of time in our yard, which I consider our second living room in the spring and summer. It's where we eat, play, and where I do my gardening, which is my one big hobby/passion. Pretty much every time our neighbor hears me hanging out in the yard with my son, he comes over and knocks on the gate. I have let him in to have a short visit a handful of times, and it was fine. \n\nBut after several instances, I found that it was causing me a lot of stress and exhaustion to navigate these visits because A) I had not been expecting to socialize, so half the time I'm in jammies or my son is naked or I'm just plain grumpy because life is busy and tiring; B) I was trying to get things done in my yard, and I'm itching to get back to the task I was focused on; C) I have to also keep one eye on my demanding toddler the whole time, which can already be very draining even without having to socialize simultaneously; D) I was experiencing anxiety going outside because I expecting him to knock at any moment for a nice long chat; E) sometimes we are having a visit with my immediate family or close friends, and we want to spend time with just them; and F) I have to be quite vigilant because I've noticed neighbor does not have a sense of appropriate physical boundaries with my son, who is very friendly and physically affectionate with pretty much everybody. Wants to pick him up like a baby, lets him hug and kiss him and climb all over his lap, etc. He doesn't mean any harm but it's still just an additional thing I need to think about when he's over.\n\nSo I stopped letting him in and just stood at the gate for quick neighborly chats when he would come by. He makes it clear he wants to come inside the yard, but I always have a reason to keep the visit short and light. I say things like, \"We're having some family time/we're eating dinner/we're not feeling great today/we're really busy getting stuff done, so we'll see you another day, but thanks for stopping by!\" But he will come over the next day to see if it's a good time, or he will ask if we can schedule a visit. He will also text me frequently, although I usually do not respond, except on holidays to return well wishes.\n\nI feel un-neighborly saying it, but at the root of all this is that I'm just not interested, or even mentally able, to socialize with an acquaintance this often. I don't even socialize with my own parents this much, and they live two blocks away. My quiet time, privacy, and calm/happy outdoor time with my family are sacred. I have not explained this at length to my neighbor, because I'm not sure how to state it without hurting his feelings. But if I'm completely honest, we do not have anything in common and I am just not interested in having a social relationship with him except occasionally saying hello in passing, like I do with our other neighbors.\n\nMy goal, put frankly, is for him to never knock on our gate at all. For me, it is the equivalent of him knocking on my front door for a visit. I feel like I sound like a horrible callous person for wanting him out of my life, but it's just how I feel and it's the boundary I need. I also can't stand it when people drop by unexpectedly, even people I know really well.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to say that will reach him, since he simply doesn't understand social cues. I like him, I think he's perfectly friendly, and I do not want him to feel badly, because I think it's wonderful that he gets himself out there and socializes. I know he makes the rounds every day with several houses (and I also know another family we're friendly with, his neighbor on the other side, is experiencing the same discomfort that we are). If we have parties where neighbors are invited, he is included. But that is the extent of my desired relationship with him. How can I tell someone, clearly and explicitly but without hurting their feelings, that I don't want them knocking on my door?\n\nTL;DR My [30sF] autistic neighbor [20sM] knocks on my gate for a long chat every time we are outside, several times a week in nice weather, and as an introvert, it is exhausting me. How to set boundaries kindly but firmly?",
    "human_response": "As an autistic person, just tell him. Literally. Say it. \n\n\u201cHey, we love you coming around when you come for parties and what not, but we don\u2019t like when you just turn up without a direct invitation. Can you not do that anymore?\u201d",
    "model_response": "I understand your concerns and boundaries. It's great that you've already established a system of politely declining his requests to enter your yard, but it's clear that he's not picking up on the cues. Since he's autistic, it's likely that he's genuinely trying to connect and socialize, but he may not understand the nuances of social boundaries.\n\nTo approach this situation, I suggest having an open and honest conversation with your neighbor. It's better to be direct and clear about your boundaries rather than leading him on or giving him false hope. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Choose a good time to talk: When you're both outside, and you're not feeling rushed or stressed, take a moment to talk to your neighbor. You might say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to take a minute to talk to you about our interactions. I value our neighborly chats, but I need to be honest with you - as an introvert, I need some quiet time to recharge. When you knock on the gate, I know you're trying to socialize, but it's becoming overwhelming for me.\"\n2. Be specific and clear: Explain your reasons for not wanting to socialize as frequently as he does. You can say something like, \"I have a busy schedule with my family, and I need some dedicated time to focus on my son and my own well-being. When you knock on the gate, it interrupts my flow and makes it difficult for me to get back to what I need to do.\"\n3. Set boundaries: Let him know that you appreciate his enthusiasm, but you'd prefer it if he didn't knock on the gate as frequently. You can say something like, \"Going forward, I'd prefer it if we kept our interactions to quick hellos and catch-ups when we're outside. I know it might be disappointing, but I hope you understand that this is what I need.\"\n4. Offer alternatives: If you do want to spend time with him, suggest alternative ways to connect, such as a weekly phone call or a planned visit at a different time. You can say something like, \"If you'd like to catch up, we could schedule a call or meet up at a different time. That way, I can make sure I have the time and energy to devote to our conversation.\"\n5. Be firm but kind: Remember to be firm and clear in your boundaries, but also be kind and understanding. Acknowledge that he's trying to connect and that you appreciate his enthusiasm. You can say something like, \"I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and I value our friendship. Let's focus on keeping our interactions to quick hellos and planned visits, and I think that will work out well for both of us.\"\n\nRemember that setting boundaries is not about being mean or callous; it's about being honest and clear about your needs. By being direct and respectful, you can help your neighbor understand your boundaries and find a mutually respectful way to interact.",

    "model_response": "I love that quote! It's indeed a powerful concept. Discipline is a crucial aspect of personal growth, and it's great that you're recognizing its importance. Maintaining discipline, however, can be a challenge. Here are some strategies to help you cultivate and sustain a disciplined mindset:\n\n1. **Set clear goals**: Identify what you want to achieve and set specific, measurable, and attainable goals. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks to help you stay focused.\n2. **Create a routine**: Establish a daily routine that includes time for self-reflection, journaling, or meditation. Consistency breeds discipline. Start with small, achievable habits and gradually increase their frequency or duration.\n3. **Track progress**: Keep a journal or use a habit-tracking app to monitor your progress. Seeing your accomplishments can boost motivation and help you stay accountable.\n4. **Develop a pre-commitment ritual**: Before starting a task, perform a small, ritualistic action that signals to your brain that it's time to focus. This could be as simple as making a cup of coffee, doing a quick stretch, or saying a motivational phrase.\n5. **Understand the why**: Connect with your reasons for wanting to develop discipline. Remind yourself why this is important to you, and let that purpose drive your actions.\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant. This helps to build momentum and reinforce the idea that discipline is a sustainable habit.\n7. **Be kind to yourself**: Don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. Recognize that setbacks are opportunities to learn and adjust. Get back on track as soon as possible, and remember that discipline is a journey, not a destination.\n8. **Find accountability**: Share your goals and progress with a trusted friend or mentor. This can provide an added motivation to stay on track, as you'll feel more responsible for reporting back to them.\n9. **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness exercises can help you develop greater self-awareness, allowing you to recognize when your mind is wandering and refocus your attention.\n10. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to make discipline a part of your daily routine, so it becomes second nature.\n\nRemember, developing discipline is a process that takes time and effort. It's normal for motivation to ebb and flow, but by incorporating these strategies, you can cultivate a more disciplined mindset that will help you achieve your goals and maintain it over time.\n\nKeep in mind that discipline is not about forcing yourself to do things you dislike, but rather about creating a system that supports your growth and well-being. By making small, incremental changes, you'll be more likely to stick to your goals and maintain a disciplined mindset in the long run.",

I didn't feel ready to have sex yet so I didn't. He asked if I was ready a couple of times but I said no and he didn't push the matter.  We celebrated our 3rd anniversary by going to a concert and dinner and drinks.  Then about 2 weeks later, he broke up with me and I was totally devastated. I literally cried for like 2 days nonstop.

When you're confident in your own worth, you'll be less concerned with what others think.\n10. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're human. Forgive yourself for any perceived transgressions and move forward with kindness and compassion.\n\nRemember, gaining control over the feeling of caring what others think takes time, patience, and practice. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With time and effort, you'll develop a more balanced perspective, and you'll find that you're no longer controlled by the opinions of others.",

    "sentence": "My fiancee and I go through difficult times. We try to get pregnant, we try to find an affordable house, we try to manage our stressful full time jobs, and keep our chaotic families at bay. Yesterday we had a very lovely Sunday (went to a lake, enjoyed ourselves, had some ice cream) until in the evening she did a test and found out that she's again not pregnant. She was devastated. I tried to comfort her, listen, take care of her. But she began to push me away, first with comments like \"you don't care\", then physically. She said that she regrets not pressuring me into having a baby 5 years ago (and finding a house, and more). Then we argued about whether she blames me for our problems (which we often do, and which she never directly answers). We do that often, but I tried hard not to defend myself and still just be there for her. \n\nWhen we went to bed I tried to comfort her again, but she again pushed me away and even said \"leave me alone\". So I retreated back to my side of the bed, and eventually slept away.\n\nThis morning, she began accusing me of exactly that: I would not care, I would keep my distance, turn around and just go to sleep.\n\nI don't know how to handle this situation. I get it when someone says s/he needs distance. Even her friends told me to keep distance and let her breath. But every time I do that, she gets even more furious. How do you comfort someone who tells you with both words and body language that she does not want to be comforted; but later on accuses you of not being there for her?\n\nTL;DR: every time my girlfriend is sad I try to comfort her, but then she pushes me away, so I keep my distance. Some time later she blames me for exactly that behaviour of keeping my distance. How does one handle this?",
    "human_response": "So I am sometimes guilty of this myself: pushing my partner away (or anyone really) and then when they do give me space, it validates my irrational belief that they don't want me around. \n\nAnd I realised that I was seeking validation but I wasn't willing to accept it because I didn't feel that I deserved it. \n\nTell your partner that you love her, that you are there for her, and all she needs to do is ask you. Be it verbally, or non-verbally. But also tell her that you can't read her mind and that she needs to be straight with you about what she needs.\n\nBest of luck OP. Hope you both get through these trying times together.",
    "model_response": "I can sense the frustration and concern in your words. It's like you're caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, you want to be there for your girlfriend during her difficult times, but on the other hand, she's pushing you away and then blaming you for not being there.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel stuck and unsure about how to navigate this situation. It's not uncommon for people to push away those they love during times of distress, and it's even more challenging when they later accuse you of not being there for them.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to comfort her, try to validate her emotions. When she's pushing you away, acknowledge her feelings and let her know that you understand she's struggling. You can say something like, \"I can see that you're really upset, and I'm here for you. I'm not going anywhere, but I also understand that you need some space right now. Can we find a compromise? Maybe we can take some time apart, and then come back together when you're ready to talk or be close?\"\n\nThis approach acknowledges her feelings and gives her space without abandoning her. It also opens up the possibility for a later conversation about what she needs from you during those difficult times.\n\nRegarding her accusations, try not to take them personally. It's possible that her anger and frustration are a result of her own emotional pain and sense of powerlessness. When she accuses you of not caring or keeping your distance, try to respond with empathy and understanding. You can say something like, \"I know you're feeling really hurt and frustrated right now, and I'm here to listen. I understand that it's hard for you to see things clearly when you're upset. Can we talk about what's really going on for you, and how I can support you better?\"\n\nRemember that you can't fix her emotions or make her feel better overnight. What you can do is be present, empathetic, and understanding. By doing so, you're showing her that you care about her feelings and are willing to work through the tough times together.\n\nLastly, consider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're struggling to navigate this situation and that you need her to be honest with you about what she needs from you during these difficult times. It's possible that she's not even aware of the impact her actions are having on you, and a conversation can help clear the air and improve your communication.",

    "model_response": "Dealing with a 14-year-old sibling can be challenging, especially when they're making choices that concern you. It's natural to worry about their well-being and future. Here's a balanced approach to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. **Stay calm and composed**: It's essential to manage your emotions when dealing with a teenager. Take a deep breath, count to ten, or step away for a moment to collect your thoughts before reacting. This will help you respond more effectively.\n2. **Have an open and honest conversation**: Choose a private setting where your sister feels comfortable and won't be distracted. Use \"I\" statements to express your concerns, avoiding accusatory language. For example: \"I've noticed you've been hanging out with a new group of friends, and I'm worried about the influence they might have on your life.\" This approach shows you care about her feelings and are coming from a place of concern.\n3. **Listen actively**: Give your sister space to share her perspective, and actively listen to what she has to say. Avoid interrupting or dismissing her thoughts. This will help her feel heard and understood, which can reduce defensiveness.\n4. **Focus on the issues, not the person**: Instead of attacking her character or labeling her as \"horrible,\" address specific behaviors or choices that concern you. For example: \"I'm worried about the impact of skipping school to hang out with friends. How can we find alternative ways for you to spend time with friends that don't compromise your education?\"\n5. **Set clear boundaries and consequences**: Establishing clear rules and consequences can help your sister understand the expectations. Make sure she knows that you're not trying to restrict her freedom, but rather to protect her well-being and future.\n6. **Offer support and resources**: Help your sister find positive influences and activities that align with her interests. Encourage her to join clubs, teams, or volunteer work that can provide a sense of belonging and purpose.\n7. **Seek professional help if needed**: If your sister's behavior persists and is causing significant distress or harm, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide guidance and support to help her develop healthier habits and coping mechanisms.\n8. **Lead by example**: As a role model, it's essential to demonstrate positive behaviors and values yourself. Your sister is more likely to follow your example than your words, so make sure you're practicing what you preach.\n9. **Be patient and persistent**: Changing habits and behaviors takes time, effort, and consistency. Be patient and continue to have open conversations with your sister, even if progress is slow.\n10. **Take care of yourself**: Lastly, don't forget to prioritize your own well-being. Dealing with a challenging sibling can be emotionally draining. Make time for self-care, seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed, and remember that you're not alone in this journey.\n\nRemember, as a sibling, you have a unique opportunity to influence your sister's life. By approaching the situation with empathy, understanding, and guidance, you can help her develop healthier habits and a more positive outlook for her future.",

The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to.

That takes a lot of courage.\n\nGiven your circumstances, it might be challenging to find people who understand and accept you for who you are. However, I want to encourage you to keep trying. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Online communities:** While you mentioned you don't want to add anyone on other platforms, you might consider joining online forums or social media groups focused on topics that interest you, such as parenting, autism, or self-care. You can participate in discussions, share your experiences, and connect with others who might understand you better.\n2. **Local resources:** Look for local organizations, community centers, or libraries that offer programs or events for single parents, new mothers, or people with disabilities (if you're indeed on the autism spectrum). These might be great places to meet others who share similar experiences and interests.\n3. **Language exchange:** Since you mentioned your coworkers don't speak English, you might consider reaching out to local language exchange programs or online resources that connect people who want to learn English with native speakers. This could be a great way to meet new people and practice your language skills.\n4. **Support hotlines:** There are several hotlines and helplines that offer support for single parents, survivors of abuse, and people with disabilities. You can find a list of resources online or through your local health department.\n5. **Self-care:** Don't underestimate the importance of self-care. Make time for activities that bring you joy, even if it's just 15-20 minutes a day. This could be reading, drawing, taking a walk, or practicing meditation.\n\nRegarding your concerns about moving, it's understandable that you're hesitant. However, you might consider reaching out to local organizations that support people from diverse backgrounds, such as the African American Community Resource Center or the Somali Community Center in Mankato. They might be able to provide guidance on finding welcoming communities or resources.\n\nLastly, please remember that you're not alone in your struggles. It's okay to acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed, and it's okay to ask for help. You deserve support and understanding, and I'm here to offer what I can.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. You got this, and you're stronger than you think.",

But, I'm here to tell you that it's okay to acknowledge that it's time to move on.\n\nFirstly, let's address the notion that you feel obligated to play World of Warcraft because of the time and money you've invested. While it's true that you've put in a lot of effort, it's important to recognize that your happiness and well-being are more valuable than any amount of time or money. You can't put a price on your mental health and emotional well-being.\n\nSecondly, let's talk about the idea that you feel like you'd be wasting your investment if you quit. Newsflash: you're not going to get that time and money back, no matter what. But, what you can do is take that energy and redirect it towards something that brings you joy and fulfillment. You can use that time and money to invest in yourself, your relationships, or your passions.\n\nNow, I know it's scary to think about leaving behind the progress and memories you've made in the game. But, the truth is, those memories will always be there, and you can always look back on them fondly. You don't have to be actively playing the game to hold onto those memories. And, who knows, you might find that you're able to create even more meaningful memories by stepping away from the game and focusing on other aspects of your life.\n\nLastly, let's address the toxic community aspect. It's amazing that you're recognizing that it's affecting your mental health and well-being. That's a huge step! It's okay to prioritize your own well-being over the game and the community. You don't have to be part of something that's causing you harm.\n\nSo, how can you convince yourself to quit? Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n1. Acknowledge that it's okay to let go. It's okay to admit that the game is no longer bringing you joy and that it's time to move on.\n2. Recognize that your happiness and well-being are more important than any amount of time or money you've invested.\n3. Make a plan for how you'll redirect your time and energy. This could be towards a new hobby, a new game, or simply spending more time with loved ones.\n4. Celebrate your progress and memories. Acknowledge the good times you've had in the game and the friends you've made, but don't feel like you need to be actively playing to hold onto those memories.\n5. Take small steps. Don't feel like you need to quit cold turkey. You can start by taking a break, or reducing the amount of time you spend playing. See how that feels, and then make a decision from there.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize yourself and your well-being. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and sometimes that means letting go of something that's no longer serving you.",

Then I convince myself that I must finish my train of thought if I'm going to convince anyone of my position, which causes me to spew out 100 smaller arguments within the context of a larger idea (this technique is known as the [Gish Gallop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)). Online it's not so bad b/c people can reread and quote what I've said, but IRL it makes it impossible for others to get a word in or have a constructive dialog. \n\nI hate that I do this and I'm looking for techniques to stop myself. \n\nWhatcha got, Reddit?",
    "human_response": "Most importantly: know the purpose and the structure of an effective debate.  If your debate fails either one of these, it is not effective, and you should back away.\n\nThe purpose of a debate is to argue a subjective opinion built upon objective facts to convince others your opinion is correct.  If you try to argue a point whose only supporting evidence is other opinions you have, you should have a discussion instead, which is where you just discuss opinions in a relaxed manner.\n\nThe structure of a debate is \"point, counter-point, rebuttal\".  State a single, specific opinion you have, then state some facts that surround it.  Limit each fact to 30 seconds or so, and do not bring up multiple facts at once.  Then, let your opponent respond to that fact.  Then you can discuss your opponent's response, and segue onto the next fact.\n\nBreathe.  Taking a deep breath is the best general advice I can give you.  It punctuates your speech, calms you down, lets you gather your thoughts, and allows your opponent time to respond.\n\nRecognize your audience.  You are almost never trying to convince the person you are debating with that you are right; you are convincing some third party, such as people listening to the discussion that you are right.\n\nPrepare your points.  It is fine if to prove your point you must first say 100 other things, but you have to space them out, let people examine and question each one either individually or in small sets, and let them soak in.  If you find yourself speaking until you are out of breath, make sure you take a nice long inhale, and then let your opponent speak about that.\n\nRemain calm and collected.  If you get angry or even seem that way, people are less inclined to side with you.  Speak level and slowly by practicing your breathing and not getting excited.  If you hear your voice raising, take a deep breath.\n\nFinally, recognize when a debate is futile.  If you are not getting anywhere, the other person is yelling, or they just aren't understanding what you are saying, sometimes it is best to just realize the person is not going to get it and to walk away or change the subject.",
    "model_response": "The Gish Gallop, a classic debating tactic that can be both persuasive and alienating. It's great that you're aware of your tendency and willing to work on it. Here are some techniques to help you curb your enthusiasm and foster more constructive debates:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Before you respond, make a conscious effort to listen carefully to the other person's perspective. Repeat back what you've understood from their argument to ensure you're on the same page. This will help you stay focused and avoid dominating the conversation.\n2. **Pause and breathe**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, take a deep breath and pause for a moment. This simple pause can help you regain composure and avoid launching into a Gish Gallop.\n3. **Set a timer**: Challenge yourself to limit your responses to a specific time frame, say 30 seconds to 1 minute. This will help you stay concise and avoid overwhelming others with too much information.\n4. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of launching into a lengthy argument, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share their thoughts and opinions. This can help shift the focus away from your own views and create a more collaborative atmosphere.\n5. **Use the \"3-2-1\" rule**: When responding, try to summarize the other person's argument in 3 sentences, acknowledge their point in 2 sentences, and then add your own perspective in 1 sentence. This helps you stay focused and avoid dominating the conversation.\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your emotions and physical responses during debates. Regular mindfulness practice can reduce your stress levels and help you stay calm and composed in heated discussions.\n7. **Seek feedback**: Ask trusted friends or family members to observe your debating style and provide feedback on how you can improve. They may notice patterns or behaviors that you're not aware of and offer suggestions for change.\n8. **Learn to agree to disagree**: It's okay to acknowledge that you may not see eye-to-eye with someone, and that's okay. Practice accepting that it's possible to have differing opinions and move forward without feeling the need to \"win\" the argument.\n\nRemember, the goal of a debate or discussion shouldn't be to \"win\" or prove a point, but to engage in a respectful and constructive exchange of ideas. By practicing these techniques, you can become a more effective and respectful communicator.",

For example, \"I saw your post about [shared interest] on social media, how's your project going?\"\n3. Ask open-ended questions: Instead of asking yes or no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves.

And keep ruminating what might go wrong and if I've made any mistakes at work.\n\nI know it'll get better when I'm more familiarized with my job scope.

    "model_response": "I'm glad you reached out for help! Feeling physically suffocated at work can be really tough to deal with. I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some advice that might help you cope with the stress and anxiety.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're acknowledging that it's normal to feel overwhelmed in a new role. It's okay to not know everything, and it's normal to feel anxious about making mistakes. However, it's essential to recognize that rumination can be a significant contributor to your physical symptoms. Try to catch yourself when you start spiraling into negative thoughts and redirect your attention to the present moment.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you feel more centered and breathe easier:\n\n1. **Deep breathing exercises**: Take short breaks throughout the day to practice deep, slow breaths. Inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. This can help slow down your heart rate and calm your nervous system.\n2. **Physical activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety. Try to incorporate some physical activity into your daily routine, even if it's just a short walk during your lunch break or a few jumping jacks during commercial breaks while watching TV.\n3. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness meditation or guided relaxation exercises to help calm your mind and body. You can find plenty of free resources online, or download an app like Headspace or Calm.\n4. **Prioritize tasks**: When you're feeling overwhelmed, it's essential to prioritize your tasks and focus on the most critical ones first. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and take regular breaks to avoid burnout.\n5. **Boundary setting**: Learn to say \"no\" to non-essential tasks and set realistic expectations with your colleagues and manager. Remember, you're not expected to do everything on your own.\n6. **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation outside of work. Whether it's reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing yoga, prioritize self-care to help you unwind.\n7. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. Sharing your concerns with someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood.\n8. **Reframe your thinking**: When you start to feel anxious about making mistakes, remind yourself that it's a natural part of the learning process. Reframe your thoughts by focusing on what you've accomplished and what you've learned so far.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed in a new role. By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you might find that you're better equipped to handle the stress and anxiety, and your physical symptoms start to improve.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to prioritize your well-being and take care of yourself during this time. If your symptoms persist or worsen, consider speaking with a healthcare professional for further guidance.",

    "sentence": "She's a friend of my boyfriend from university. I met her once at my boyfriend\u2018s birthday party a year ago. They were having fun remembering the evenings the two of them spent together drinking wine.\n\nA couple of weeks later he told me he would be meeting up with her to have a few glasses of wine again.  \nI then asked him how he knew her and if there was ever anything between them. He just said 'No, but she would be pretty... she's always been in relationships though.\u2018 That was the end of the conversation.  \nHe apparently didn't end up seeing her because he was too busy. He never mentioned her again for a whole year.\n\nLast week I asked my boyfriend if she would come to his birthday party this summer again and if he ever saw her over the year since he never mentioned her. He reluctantly admitted 'Yes, I might have seen her once or so'. I kept on asking and then it turned out he drove over an hour to spend the evening with her at her parents' house a couple of months ago. I wanted to know why he didn't tell me about it (we ask how each others day went everyday!) and he was just ''I probably just forgot to tell you or I didn't want to make you worry, I don't know\" \"You're making a big deal out of nothing.\" ''Am I not allowed to have pretty female friends'' \"You're being extremely jealous'', \u201cYou\u2018re overreacting\u201c,...  \n\nApart from that, she also came to his parents restaurant with her family twice or so over the year and probably saw him as well. At least he did end up saying (completely annoyed though):'I will deliberately tell you beforehand when I see her in the future'. The next time we had a conversation about this he wanted to reassure me their friendship is purely platonic.\n\nAnyways, I used to feel like I can trust my boyfriend 100%, and now I am constantly worried. Around that month that he met up with her I had this weird gut feeling that he has met someone else or that I can't trust him anymore... I've talked to him about his female friend three times after finding out but I still don't feel better. I would like for the relationship to work and I want to trust him, but I don't know how to go about this. What can I do to be able to trust him again fully?  \n\n\nTL;DR : She's an old friend of my boyfriend who he has spent a lot of evenings drinking wine with. I met her once at a party and I asked who she was. He said she's and old friend, nothing ever happened between them but that she would be pretty and that she\u2019s always been in relationships. He never mentioned her again for a whole year. I asked him about her a week ago and it turned out that he drove over an hour to see her for an evening at  her parents house a couple of months ago. We talk about our day everyday and he didn't mention seeing her. When I told him that it bothered me that he wasn't honest he told me I'm overreacting. I want our relationship to work but I can't fully trust him anymore.\n\n\nEdit: Should I tell him I sometimes feel so bad about it it\u2018s making me consider leaving the relationship?\nEdit Edit: I used to feel really secure in the relationship because I was his first ever girlfriend and the first girl he ever introduced to his family (even though I am sure he had other options) and he made me feel really special. \n\nEdit Edit Edit: I\u2019m currently at my boyfriend\u2019s place and skimmed through their messages... He met up with her in March. She messaged him at 1:30am \u201eDid you get home safely\u201c, he was like \u201eYes, everything went well\u201c and she wrote \u201eI had a really nice time with you\ud83d\ude0a\u201c. He then messaged her about once a month asking her how she\u2018s doing and inviting her to his events or asking if she wants to meet up but she always cancelled... I didn\u2018t go any further back than MarchSorry for the length of my postMy friends are telling me I should just forget about this whole situation and not ruin my relationship because of 'jealousy'.

    "model_response": "I understand your concerns and feelings of insecurity. It's natural to feel that way given the situation. Here's my take on things:\n\nFirstly, it's not about being jealous; it's about feeling betrayed and hurt that your partner didn't prioritize honesty and transparency with you. You've shared your daily lives with each other, and it's reasonable to expect openness about social interactions.\n\nYour boyfriend's responses to your concerns, such as \"You're making a big deal out of nothing\" and \"You're being extremely jealous,\" are dismissive and unhelpful. It's essential to address these issues directly and assertively.\n\nTo regain trust, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Approach the conversation calmly and specifically, focusing on your own feelings and needs rather than accusing him of wrongdoing. You might say something like:\n\n\"I've been feeling really hurt and insecure since finding out about your meeting with [her name]. I understand that you're entitled to have friends, but I feel like you didn't prioritize honesty and transparency with me. It's making me wonder if there's something I'm missing or if you're not being fully open with me. Can we work on rebuilding trust and communication in our relationship?\"\n\nIt's also essential to establish clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship. You might discuss what you're comfortable with regarding his interactions with female friends and what you expect from him in terms of honesty and communication.\n\nAs for your friends' advice to \"just forget about it and not ruin your relationship,\" I wouldn't agree with that. It's essential to address the issue and work through it together. Ignoring the problem might lead to further resentment and mistrust.\n\nRegarding your feelings of insecurity, it's understandable given the situation. You've been his first girlfriend, and he's made you feel special. It's natural to feel concerned about losing that specialness. However, it's crucial to remember that relationships evolve, and it's normal to face challenges. You can work through this together and strengthen your bond by being open and honest with each other.\n\nLastly, it's not about being \"overreacting\" or \"jealous.\" It's about feeling valued, respected, and trusted in your relationship. You deserve that, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nRemember, trust is built on open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to work through challenges together.",

    "human_response": "Where I'm at students qualify, and they expanded eligibility because of the pandemic. You might live somewhere different though.",
    "model_response": "The short answer is: it's possible, but not necessarily likely. Here's why:\n\nWhen you fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), your information is shared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The USDA uses this information to determine eligibility for SNAP benefits.\n\nHowever, the FAFSA only shares limited information with the USDA, such as your income, family size, and student status (i.e., undergraduate, graduate, or professional). The USDA does not receive information about your academic performance, academic program, or financial aid awards.\n\nThat being said, if you're receiving financial aid or other forms of assistance, such as scholarships or grants, and you're also applying for SNAP benefits, there might be some overlap between the two programs. For instance, if you're receiving a large amount of financial aid, it could potentially impact your SNAP eligibility.\n\nIf you're concerned about confidentiality, it's essential to remember that SNAP officials are bound by confidentiality laws and regulations. They're only authorized to use the information they receive from the FAFSA for determining eligibility and administering the program.\n\nTo minimize the risk of your college status being disclosed, consider the following:\n\n1. Only provide accurate and necessary information on the FAFSA.\n2. Be cautious when discussing your financial situation or aid packages with SNAP officials, as they may ask follow-up questions.\n3. If you're concerned about your eligibility for SNAP benefits, you can contact your local SNAP office or a social worker for guidance.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to be honest and transparent when applying for government assistance programs. While it's unlikely that SNAP officials will discover your college status solely based on your FAFSA information, being truthful and cooperative can help ensure a smoother application process and avoid any potential issues down the line.",

Here are some tips to help you keep work at work and reduce mental obsessing:\n\n1. **Set clear boundaries**: Establish a \"shutdown\" routine before leaving work. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, doing some stretching, or meditating for 5-10 minutes. This helps signal to your brain that work mode is over.\n2. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation outside of work. This could be reading, exercise, or spending time with loved ones. A happy, fulfilled you is less likely to ruminate on work-related thoughts.\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: When you catch yourself thinking about work outside of work hours, acknowledge the thought and gently redirect your attention to the present moment. Try a mindfulness app like Headspace or Calm to help you develop this habit.\n4. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative self-talk by reframing mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of beating yourself up over a mistake, focus on what you can do differently next time.\n5. **Limit social media and news**: Avoid scrolling through work-related social media or news outside of work hours. This can perpetuate the cycle of work-related thoughts and anxiety.\n6. **Schedule downtime**: Make time for relaxation and leisure activities in your daily planner. Treat them as non-negotiable appointments to ensure you prioritize your well-being.\n7. **Seek support**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend, family member, or mentor. Talking through your concerns can help you gain perspective and develop a support network.\n8. **Re-evaluate your work environment**: If you find yourself constantly checking work emails or taking work calls outside of work hours, consider setting boundaries with your manager or colleagues. You can also explore ways to optimize your workspace to promote a healthy work-life balance.\n9. **Practice gratitude**: Reflect on the things you're grateful for outside of work, no matter how small they may seem. Focusing on the positive aspects of your life can help shift your attention away from work-related worries.\n10. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Remember that it takes time to develop new habits and shift your mindset. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Be patient, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if you're struggling with persistent mental health concerns.",

I'm currently a college student but I had to stop because of some issues.\n\nDuring the first semester in college I was doing fine, just like how a normal student would.

Then the first semester finals came, there were a lot of projects that was needed to be done, some of them are group projects but I did almost all of it alone. Some of my friends needed my help with their projects and I kindly helped all of them. It was very tiring and stressful, as far as I can remember it was the first and most stressful weeks of my academic life but despite all of the struggles I managed to survive the first semester.\n\nThe second semester started, two to three weeks in I was still doing fine but eventually I became less inspired as day goes by. I slowly stopped doing homework, I stopped attending classes, I feel very drained. Those days of not attending classes became a month, I just stopped doing anything. Every time I try to do some school related stuff all of a sudden I feel sleepy, out of energy and uninterested. I just started avoiding everything that is school related. I had one friend that I talk to often but when he messages me about academics I just ignore his messages, when I feel like his message is gonna be related to academics I immediately stop reading it and not talk to him.

It's not uncommon for students to experience burnout, and it's great that you're taking a step back to re-evaluate your situation.\n\nSince you're planning to return to college next school year, let's focus on strategies to help you overcome your current feelings and get back on track. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Take small steps**: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the thought of catching up on everything, start with small, manageable tasks. Set aside 15-20 minutes each day to work on a specific task, like reviewing notes, reading a chapter, or doing a simple assignment. This will help you build momentum and confidence.\n2. **Reconnect with your why**: Reflect on why you wanted to attend college in the first place. What are your goals and aspirations? What do you hope to achieve? Connecting with your purpose can help you regain motivation and enthusiasm.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, or month, including dedicated time for studying, self-care, and relaxation. Sticking to a routine can help you establish a sense of structure and accountability.\n4. **Seek support**: Reach out to your friend who you haven't been talking to about academics. Share your struggles with them, and ask for their support and guidance. You can also consider talking to a counselor or academic advisor for additional help.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Exercise, meditation, reading, or hobbies can help reduce stress and increase energy levels.\n6. **Re-evaluate your expectations**: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect. You don't have to be a straight-A student or a high-achiever. Focus on making progress, not perfection.\n7. **Take breaks**: Remember that it's essential to take breaks and rest when needed. Allow yourself time to recharge and come back to your studies when you're feeling more refreshed.\n\nRemember, overcoming burnout and regaining motivation takes time. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results.\n\nLastly, while Reddit can be a great resource, it's not the only place to seek help. Consider reaching out to your college's counseling services, academic advisors, or mentors for personalized guidance and support.\n\nYou got this! You can start fresh and build momentum.",

Is it just physical attraction or is there something more? Are you connecting on a deeper level, sharing similar values, or finding common interests? If it's just physical attraction, take some time to get to know them as a person before jumping into romantic territory.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on building a friendship first. Ask them about their interests, hobbies, and passions. Share your own and see if there's a common ground. This will help you develop a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding, which can be a great foundation for a strong relationship.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that it's okay to take things slow. Don't feel pressured to rush into a romantic relationship just because you're attracted to someone.

Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also meet like-minded people.\n3. **Attend local events and gatherings**: Look for events in your community, such as concerts, festivals, or street fairs. You can also search for events on social media or local newspapers.\n4. **Use your job to your advantage**: While you mentioned you can't relate to coworkers on a personal level, you can still use your job to meet new people. Attend industry events, join professional associations, or participate in company-sponsored social activities.\n5. **Host your own gathering**: Invite your neighbors, colleagues, or acquaintances over for a potluck dinner, game night, or movie night. This can be a great way to break the ice and build connections in a relaxed setting.\n6. **Be patient and persistent**: Building friendships takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep attending events, joining groups, and reaching out to people until you find your tribe.\n7. **Be open-minded and friendly**: Approach new people with an open mind and a positive attitude. Be willing to listen, ask questions, and show genuine interest in getting to know others.\n\nRemember, making friends as an adult can take time, but it's not impossible. Focus on building meaningful connections with people who share similar interests and values, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Good luck!",

You'll find more like minded people to yourself. A lot of it can be random, who you end up sitting next to in class.",
    "model_response": "I'm glad you're thinking ahead and wanting to improve your social life. Making friends takes time and effort, but it's definitely possible. Here's some advice that might help:\n\nFirst, let's focus on being a good friend yourself. When you're genuinely interested in others and show kindness, empathy, and active listening, people are more likely to want to be around you. So, start by:\n\n1. Being a good listener: When you're in conversations, focus on what the other person is saying, and show genuine interest. Ask follow-up questions and try to understand their perspective.\n2. Show genuine interest in others: Ask people about their hobbies, passions, and interests. Find common ground and show enthusiasm for their passions.\n3. Be kind and respectful: Treat others with kindness, even if they're not your closest friends. A simple \"hello\" or \"how was your weekend?\" can go a long way in building relationships.\n\nNow, let's talk about making connections:\n\n1. Join a club or extracurricular activity: This can be a great way to meet like-minded people who share your interests. Even if you're not the best at something, it's okay to join and learn.\n2. Volunteer: Helping others through volunteering can be a great way to build connections and make new friends. You can search for local volunteer opportunities or check with your school to see what's available.\n3. Attend school events: Go to school events, such as sports games, concerts, or plays. These can be great opportunities to meet new people and break the ice.\n\nFinally, be patient and don't get discouraged. Making friends takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on building meaningful relationships rather than trying to accumulate a large number of acquaintances.\n\nAs for being known, it's not necessarily about being \"well-known\" as much as it is about being genuine and authentic. When you're being yourself and showing interest in others, people are more likely to notice and remember you.\n\nRemember, it's not about being the \"cool kid\" or being popular; it's about being a good person and building genuine connections with others.",

    "model_response": "Making friends with people who have little similarity or even biases against each other can be a challenging but rewarding experience. Here are some good ways to make them more comfortable and familiar:\n\n1. **Find a neutral ground**: Look for a common interest or activity that you both enjoy, even if it's not something you typically do. This can be a great conversation starter and help build a connection.\n2. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes or no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage sharing and storytelling. This can help you get to know each other better and build empathy.\n3. **Listen actively**: When the other person is speaking, make eye contact, nod, and show you're engaged. This can help them feel heard and understood, which can break down barriers.\n4. **Avoid taking things personally**: Remember that biases and differences are a natural part of human nature. Try not to take things personally and focus on finding common ground.\n5. **Be patient and respectful**: Building trust and rapport takes time. Be patient and respectful, and don't try to force the relationship or change the other person's views.\n6. **Find ways to show vulnerability**: Share your own struggles, fears, and insecurities to create a sense of mutual understanding and empathy.\n7. **Celebrate differences**: Acknowledge and celebrate the things that make each other unique, rather than trying to change or conform to each other.\n8. **Meet in a comfortable setting**: Choose a neutral location or setting that makes both of you feel comfortable and relaxed.\n9. **Avoid controversial topics**: At least initially, avoid discussing controversial or sensitive topics that may create tension or conflict.\n10. **Follow up and follow through**: After meeting, follow up with the person and check in on how they're doing. This can help build trust and show that you're committed to the friendship.\n\nRemember, building a strong connection with someone who has biases against you or has little similarity requires effort, patience, and understanding. By focusing on common ground, active listening, and mutual respect, you can create a foundation for a meaningful and lasting friendship.",

It's not uncommon for people to feel this way, especially when they compare themselves to others and feel like they're not measuring up.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your siblings are not better than you because of their talents or achievements. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's unfair to compare yourself to others. You are unique and valuable just as you are.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your family loves and cares for you deeply, and they don't see you as a burden. They may not say it often, but they appreciate the effort you put into being a part of their lives, even if you don't always feel like you're contributing in the way you want to.\n\nAs for feeling like you're not fun or interesting, that's not necessarily true. You may not be naturally outgoing or charismatic, but that doesn't mean you can't find ways to connect with others and have meaningful relationships. It might take some effort and practice, but you can develop your social skills and find common ground with others.\n\nRegarding your desire to drink and be alone, it's understandable that you might feel like that's the only way to cope with your emotions. However, I want to encourage you to explore other ways to deal with your feelings. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor? They can help you work through your emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your family wants you to be happy and fulfilled. They may not know exactly what you need, but they care about you deeply and want to support you. Instead of pushing them away, try opening up to them about your feelings and see if they can offer any guidance or support.\n\nLastly, I want to remind you that you are not a burden. You are a valuable member of your family and society, and you have so much to offer. It's okay to struggle, and it's okay to ask for help. You are not alone in this feeling, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help.

Remember, it's okay to take calculated risks and face uncertainty \u2013 it's often where the greatest growth happens.\n\nHere's a suggestion: take some time to reflect on what drives your passion for music. What specific aspects of it bring you joy? Is it the creative process, performing, or the emotional connection with others? Clarifying your motivations will help you stay focused and resilient in the face of criticism.\n\nIt's also important to surround yourself with people who believe in you and your abilities. Look for mentors, peers, or online communities that share your passion and can offer support and constructive feedback. And don't be afraid to take small steps towards your goal, even if it means starting small or experimenting with different genres or styles.

Don't worry, I've got some tips to help you manage those pesky shakes:\n\n1. **Breathe deeply and slowly**: When you start to feel the jitters, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four. Repeat this a few times.\n2. **Relax your shoulders**: When we get nervous, our shoulders tend to scrunch up towards our ears. Make a conscious effort to relax them, keeping them down and away from your ears. This can help reduce overall tension.\n3. **Use positive self-talk**: Instead of thinking \"Oh no, I'm going to shake like a leaf,\" tell yourself \"I've got this. I've prepared well, and I can handle this.\" Focus on your strengths and accomplishments.\n4. **Physical relaxation techniques**: Try some simple physical relaxation techniques like rolling your shoulders, stretching your arms and legs, or tapping your feet. These can help release tension and calm your body.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your body's physical sensations, including your nervous system. Regular practice can help you better manage anxiety and reduce physical symptoms like shaking.\n6. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: When you know you'll be in a high-stakes situation, prepare as much as possible. This can help reduce anxiety and increase confidence, which can, in turn, reduce shaking.\n7. **Get comfortable with imperfection**: Remember that it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to make mistakes or show some vulnerability. It's a natural part of being human.\n8. **Consider a pre-performance ritual**: Develop a pre-performance ritual that helps you relax, such as taking a few deep breaths, visualizing success, or doing a quick physical stretch. This can help signal to your body that it's time to relax and perform.\n9. **Practice relaxation in low-stakes situations**: Practice relaxation techniques in everyday situations, like when you're waiting in line or sitting in traffic. This can help you build confidence in your ability to manage anxiety and reduce shaking.\n10. **Seek professional help**: If your shaking is severe or interferes with your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can help you address underlying anxiety or other issues that may be contributing to your shaking.\n\nRemember, it's a process to overcome shaking, and it may take some time and practice.

It's normal to feel that way in new situations, and it's great that you're acknowledging it. Here are a few tips to help you feel more comfortable:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Research the bar you're planning to visit, check their events or specials, and arrive early to get a good spot. This will help you feel more familiar with the environment and reduce anxiety.\n2. **Dress to impress (but not too much)**: Wear something that makes you feel confident and comfortable. You don't need to dress to the nines, but put in a bit of effort to show you care. Avoid revealing or overly flashy clothing that might make you feel self-conscious.\n3. **Start with a goal, not an expectation**: Instead of going in with the expectation of meeting someone, focus on enjoying the experience and being open to whatever happens. This mindset shift can help you relax and be more present.\n4. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to be alone and that you're not missing out on anything.

Talk about the bar, the music, or a recent event. Avoid topics that might be too heavy or personal.\n2. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to the other person and show genuine interest in what they're saying. This will help build a connection and make the conversation more enjoyable.\n3. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in any social situation. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People are more likely to be drawn to someone who is genuine and comfortable in their own skin.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay if you don't meet someone special that night. The goal is to have a good time, learn to navigate social situations, and build confidence. Even if you don't meet someone, you'll still have gained valuable experience and skills that will help you in the future.\n\nAs for the guys not throwing you a glance, don't take it personally. People are often more focused on their own lives and might not even notice you. Instead, focus on the people who do catch your eye and engage with them in a friendly manner.\n\nRemember, confidence and positivity are attractive traits, so own your space and be proud of yourself for taking the leap!",

    "sentence": "How to think outside the box and actually contribute in a corporate job. I'm a software developer, and I'm really good at taking requirements and making them \"come to life\". However, where I feel like I lack the most is my ability to think outside the box and come up with cool solutions to things or new ideas that will actually make a difference.\n\nExample: I was invited to a 2016 planning meeting, and literally had no idea where to even start. I always question whether my ideas will be laughed at or will even be good enough for the business to be taken seriously, and that lack of confidence prevents me from speaking up.\n\nWhenever I'm in a meeting, I always hold back on spewing ideas (again, due to lack of confidence). Generally someone else will voice a similar idea and get solid recognition. I then decide to speak up and voice other ideas which don't get the same reactions and are mostly ignored. This bothers me so much - the fact that I hold back on saying ideas that people will like, and end up letting someone else take the spotlight. It almost feels like people hate on my ideas just because, even though I'm sure that's not the case.\n\n/rant",
    "human_response": "make sure your ideas do not come across as gripes.  \n\nThey should be actionable and even better if you just make them happen.",
    "model_response": "I totally get it! It's frustrating to feel like your ideas are being ignored or dismissed, especially when you're aware that you're a skilled developer who can bring requirements to life. It's even more disheartening when you feel like you're being held back by your own self-doubt.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle that confidence issue. It's normal to feel uncertain about sharing your ideas, especially in a corporate setting where there might be a fear of being laughed at or dismissed. But here's the thing: most people don't laugh at ideas out of malice; they might just not be aware of the potential value of your idea or might not have the same perspective.\n\nTo build your confidence, try reframing your thinking. Instead of thinking \"my idea won't be good enough,\" try thinking \"I have a unique perspective to share\" or \"I'm excited to share my idea and see how it can be improved.\" Remember that it's okay to have imperfect ideas, and the goal is to learn and grow together as a team.\n\nNow, let's talk about speaking up in meetings. It's great that you're aware of your tendency to hold back and let others take the spotlight. Here's a strategy to help you overcome that:\n\n1. Prepare beforehand: Take some time to brainstorm ideas and jot them down. This will help you feel more confident and prepared to share your thoughts.\n2. Start small: Begin by sharing a small, low-risk idea that you're passionate about. This can help you build momentum and get your voice heard.\n3. Focus on the problem, not the solution: Instead of pitching a specific solution, focus on the problem you're trying to solve. This can help you and others build a shared understanding of the issue and come up with more innovative solutions together.\n4. Practice active listening: Pay attention to others' ideas and show that you're engaged. This can help you build trust and rapport, making it easier to share your own ideas.\n5. Don't take it personally: Remember that people's reactions to your ideas are not a reflection of your worth as a developer or a person. Focus on the idea itself, not your ego.\n\nTo take it to the next level, try to think outside the box by:\n\n1. Asking questions: Encourage others to share their perspectives and ideas by asking open-ended questions. This can help you gain a deeper understanding of the problem and come up with more innovative solutions.\n2. Exploring what-ifs: Play \"what-if\" scenarios with your colleagues to generate new ideas and possibilities. This can help you think creatively and come up with novel solutions.\n3. Seeking feedback: Don't be afraid to ask for feedback on your ideas. This can help you refine your thinking and build confidence in your ideas.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to make mistakes. It's a natural part of the innovation process, and it's how we learn and grow. By building your confidence, speaking up in meetings, and thinking outside the box, you'll be well on your way to contributing more meaningfully in your role as a software developer.",

It's understandable that you're feeling upset and unsure about what to do.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's normal to feel some level of discomfort or jealousy when your partner has a history with someone else, especially someone as charismatic as a Rockette dancer. It's natural to wonder if your partner still has feelings for this person or if they're still close.\n\nHowever, the fact that your partner didn't invite you to meet his family or discuss plans with you beforehand is a red flag. It's not about you being insecure or jealous; it's about feeling excluded and disrespected.\n\nHere's the thing: your partner's actions, or lack thereof, are sending a message. By not involving you in the plans and reaching out to his ex instead, he's prioritizing someone else's company over yours. That's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nI wouldn't say your friends are biased; they're probably just reacting to your emotions and concerns. You're right to seek a more objective perspective.\n\nBefore deciding what to do next, consider this: are you willing to continue in a relationship where your partner doesn't seem to value your feelings or boundaries?

You deserve to feel seen, heard, and valued by your partner. If your partner is unwilling or unable to provide that, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

I\u2019ve been on many dates and within 15 minutes I knew this one was special. We connected and vibed incredibly well and ended up spending the night and morning/afternoon together before I had to fly out. By the end, we were talking about not knowing how to go back to our normal lives after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk for a few weeks, but I eventually reached out and we had a proper phone call for 2 hours that re-ignited the spark I felt when seeing her. After that call we talked by text or phone nearly every day. I have a very high standard for people I date and felt really comfortable with her. We lived on different sides of the country so we knew this was special to still be giving things a shot. 2 weeks after the phone call, I bought tickets to see her along with family in 4 weeks. I saw her for a weekend, spent a week with family, then planned on spending a week with her after that (turned into 2). Things went very well and felt really good and for the first time in a very long time I felt like I was falling for somebody. The first weekend felt incredible and very romantic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward about a month after that visit, I was staying with her again and we talked about monogamy (for the 2nd time - I proposed it at the end of the 2 week visit and she said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that yet, even though she was only seeing me). During that talk, I asked her the last time she slept with somebody else, and she said it was sometime after we started talking. That was fine by me. I decided to stop seeing anybody else the day after our phone call, because I really felt like this was special). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days after that, she told me that she had miscalculated the days, and slept with somebody in-between my visits. She was seeing this person casually (the guy wanted more) from around the same time we started talking on the phone, up until their last visit after I flew out the first time, and flew back the 2nd time. She said she really didn\u2019t want to the last time, but \u201clogically\u201d she needed to make sure I was right for me by sleeping with him one last time (??).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHearing this crushed me. She consistently told me and made me feel like she was only thinking about me and I genuinely thought this might be a start of something really serious.

She told me it was because she was scared, which is understandable, but upsetting to know she wasn\u2019t ever going to tell me this without me prying.

Keep the conversation light and casual, especially in the beginning.\n7. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in any conversation. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have.

Focus on the growth and learning that came from the experience.\n3. **Let go of the need for perfection**: You're not perfect, and that's okay. No one is. It's unrealistic to expect yourself to be flawless all the time. Acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, and that's enough.\n4. **Create a \"forgiveness ritual\"**: Write down the things that still bother you on a piece of paper, and then rip it up or burn it. Visualize letting go of those thoughts and emotions. You can also try writing a letter to yourself or the person you might have hurt, but don't send it. This can help you process and release the emotions.\n5. **Focus on the present**: When you start to ruminate on past mistakes, redirect your attention to the present moment. What are you grateful for? What are you looking forward to? What can you control and improve today?\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take time to let go of those thoughts. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're not alone, and you're doing the best you can.",

It was a multiple day affair with someone she\u2019s harbored feelings for, and it happened while her husband was out of town.\n\nMy sister is 10 years older than me (24F) and we are incredibly close. I have always looked up to her \u2014 put her on a pedestal, even \u2014 so this is devastating to me. I love her husband like my own brother and I\u2019m devastated for him, too. He doesn\u2019t know. No one knows but me. I did my best to be supportive and encouraged her to tell him, but she said she couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nThis has been weighing on me so heavily for more than 24 hours. My sister swore me to secrecy so I haven\u2019t even told my own husband. I want to tell him but I feel trapped by my loyalty to my sister. We\u2019re supposed to see them (my sister and her husband) in two weeks and I\u2019m worried that if I tell my husband, he won\u2019t be able to play it off at our family function. And I don\u2019t want to have to lie to my sister when she inevitably asks if I\u2019ve told him.\n\nIf you were in my situation, would you tell your spouse ASAP or wait until after our event? If it helps, the event is a two year old\u2019s birthday party (MY two year old). Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.\n\nEDIT: Just to be clear I don\u2019t want to tell her husband, I think she should be the one to do that. But I do want to tell my own husband.\n\nTLDR my sister cheated on her husband and I don\u2019t know if I should tell MY husband or not.",

It's understandable that you're torn between your loyalty to your sister and your own marriage.\n\nIn your shoes, I would probably take a more nuanced approach. I wouldn't rush to tell my spouse right away. Instead, I would take some time to process my own emotions and think carefully about the potential consequences of sharing this information.\n\nSince you're already worried about your husband's reaction, it might be helpful to consider having a calm and honest conversation with him about your concerns. You could frame it as a hypothetical scenario, asking him how he would feel if he found out about your sister's infidelity. This might help you gauge his reaction and prepare yourself for the conversation.\n\nIt's also important to consider the timing of the revelation. Since the event is a family gathering, it might be better to wait until after the party to have the conversation with your husband. This way, you can avoid any potential drama or awkwardness during the celebration.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that your husband has a right to know this information, and it's not fair to keep it from him indefinitely. You might consider setting a specific timeline for when you'll have the conversation, so you can both prepare and process the news together.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that you're not obligated to keep your sister's secret forever. While you're right that she should ultimately be the one to tell her husband, you can still have a conversation with your husband about your concerns and feelings without betraying your sister's trust. It's a delicate situation, but with care and empathy, you can navigate it in a way that respects both your sister and your own marriage.",

This could provide more affordable coverage for the child. Encourage her to check the eligibility criteria and apply if necessary.\n2. **COBRA**: Although it might not be ideal, she could consider continuing the current insurance plan for the child under COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act). This would allow her to keep the existing coverage for a limited time (usually 18-36 months) while the child's father is employed. COBRA premiums are usually higher than regular premiums, but it might be a temporary solution.\n3. **Short-term health insurance**: Another option could be a short-term health insurance plan, which can provide temporary coverage for a limited period (usually up to 12 months). These plans are often less expensive than major medical insurance plans, but they usually have more limited benefits and may not be suitable for ongoing medical needs.\n4. **State-specific assistance programs**: Some states offer programs that help low-income families with healthcare expenses. She can check with her state's department of health or human services to see if there are any programs available to assist with healthcare costs.\n5. **Negotiate with the child's father**: It's worth having an open and honest conversation with the child's father about the situation.

They might be willing to reduce the amount or offer a payment plan.\n4. **Consider a medical billing advocate**: If you're not comfortable negotiating with the hospital, you can hire a medical billing advocate to help you navigate the process.\n5. **Look into government assistance**: If you're uninsured or underinsured, you might be eligible for government assistance programs like Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.\n6. **Prioritize your debts**: If you have other debts, consider prioritizing your medical bill by paying it off first. This will help you avoid late fees and interest.\n7. **Consider a credit counseling agency**: If you're struggling to pay multiple debts, including your medical bill, consider working with a non-profit credit counseling agency.\n\nRemember, taking care of your financial health is important, and it's okay to ask for help.

My reasons don\u2019t matter here, and I figured if she really cares about my wishes and respects me as a person, she will not do it, but, nonetheless, I do it because I can afford almost anything (reasonable) I want, she has a way smaller pension than I have a salary (and she used to manage twice as much a monthly income before her mother, my great-grandma with Alzheimer\u2019s, passed away; she tries to save as much money as possible and is currently on a deficit from then), some (or most, to be honest) of the items she buys aren\u2019t among my preferences, and I feel frustrated that she spends money on things which don\u2019t bring me joy, etc. \n\nBut last time, I wanted to buy her something for lunch, I called her to ask if she\u2019s okay with it, she agreed and then I, again, told her to not bring anything.

It's possible that she's coming from a place of love and generosity, but not considering the impact on your feelings.\n\nTo address the issue of her buying things you don't want or need, you could have a specific conversation about it. For instance:\n\n\"I appreciate your generosity, but I'd like to discuss our gift-giving. Sometimes, I feel like you're buying things that aren't aligned with my preferences. Could we find other ways to show our love and appreciation for each other that feel more meaningful to me?\"\n\nRegarding the issue of communication, it's understandable that you don't want to stop talking to your grandma altogether.

You could propose a compromise, such as:\n\n\"Let's agree to discuss our needs and boundaries before seeing each other. If we both agree on something, we can make sure to respect each other's wishes. If not, we can find alternative ways to show our love and appreciation.\"\n\nRemember to be patient, empathetic, and open-minded during these conversations. It may take time for your grandma to adjust to new boundaries and expectations, but it's worth the effort to improve your relationship and foster mutual respect.\n\nLastly, consider seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor who can help you navigate these complex family dynamics.

Basically, I can't work around/with other people as my auditory processing disorder makes it hard to interact with people who I'm not completely comfortable with.\n\nMy mom suggested medical coding because a lot of the jobs are remote. And I've spent over $2000 on books and classes and am still paying a monthly amount for access to my classes which I haven't touched in like three months. My husband helped me pay for my books which are now out of date and not allowed for the exam, so I have to buy all new ones. The exam is hundreds of dollars too. And I can't do it. For the first 1/4 of the course, I did great. And then it got way more complicated and I just cannot wrap my head around it. I mean it literally makes my head hurt.\n\nI was failing all my quizzes before I just gave up a few months ago but everyone still thinks I'm working on it. My husband (30M) and I have been together for three years and want to start trying for a baby next month but he's hinging our whole future on my having a medical coding job and I am scared to tell him that I hate it and can't do it and don't want to finish it.

I work less than ten hours a week doing paperwork for a real estate agency and that even stresses me out. I'm useless.

    "model_response": "I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds really frustrating and annoying. First, let's acknowledge that it's not your fault she's behaving this way, and it's not because you're \"better\" than her academically. It's possible she's struggling with her own insecurities and is trying to cope by copying or trying to be like you.\n\nAs for how to get her to back off, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Set clear boundaries: Let her know, in a polite but firm tone, that you're not comfortable with her copying your notes or behavior. You can say something like, \"Hey, I understand you're struggling, but I'd appreciate it if you could focus on your own work. I'm happy to help if you have questions, but I need to concentrate on my own notes.\"\n2. Don't feed her attention: Avoid engaging with her or reacting to her behavior. This can inadvertently encourage her to continue trying to get a rise out of you. Instead, focus on your own work and ignore her attempts to draw you in.\n3. Talk to a teacher or school counselor: If her behavior continues and you're feeling uncomfortable or harassed, consider speaking with a teacher or school counselor. They can help mediate the situation and provide guidance on how to handle it.\n4. Practice assertive communication: When you do need to address her behavior, use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. For example, \"I feel uncomfortable when you copy my notes. Could you please focus on your own work?\" instead of \"You're always copying me, stop it.\"\n5. Focus on your own growth: Instead of worrying about what she's doing, focus on your own academic and personal growth. Try to find ways to stay engaged and motivated, and celebrate your own successes.\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. By setting clear boundaries, ignoring her attempts to get a rise out of you, and focusing on your own growth, you can minimize her negative impact on your life.",

Your date might appreciate your transparency and trustworthiness more than you think.\n\nThat being said, if you still want to attend the concert and don't want to tell the truth, here's a suggestion: instead of saying you're the DD, try to come up with a more plausible excuse that's not too obvious. You could say you're meeting a friend or family member at the venue, or that you have an early commitment the next morning and need to get home early.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that lying can lead to more problems down the line. If your date finds out, it could damage your trust and credibility. It's essential to weigh the potential benefits of attending the concert against the potential risks to your relationship.\n\nLastly, consider this: if your date is the type of person who would be understanding and supportive of your desire to attend a 21+ concert, they might be the kind of partner you want to be with. On the other hand, if they're not okay with it, maybe it's better to know sooner rather than later.\n\nSo, what's it gonna be? Are you gonna be honest and upfront, or are you gonna spin a yarn?

It's great that you're being honest with your partner and working on your issues through therapy and support groups.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your partner's discomfort with your overtly sexual behavior is a valid concern, and it's not about suppressing your sexuality but about respecting their boundaries. It's crucial to prioritize their feelings and needs in this relationship.\n\nRegarding your examples, it's understandable that you want to find ways to maintain a healthy sexual dynamic in your relationship. However, it's essential to consider your partner's perspective and boundaries. For instance:\n\n1. When she asks you to help her stretch, it's not about not admiring her physical appearance but about focusing on the activity itself. You could respond by saying, \"I'd be happy to help you stretch, let's focus on the exercise together.\"\n2. When she says something that you find attractive, you could respond in a more neutral way, such as, \"I'm glad you said that\" or \"That's great.\" Avoid using language that makes her feel uncomfortable or objectified.\n3. The door-slap gesture might seem harmless to you, but it could be perceived as inappropriate or invasive by your partner. Consider finding alternative ways to show affection, like a gentle touch on the arm or a smile.\n\nTo find a healthy compromise, you could try the following:\n\n* Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and feelings. Explain that you understand her discomfort and are willing to work together to find a balance that works for both of you.\n* Ask your partner what specific behaviors make her feel uncomfortable and try to avoid those. You could also ask her what she would prefer in terms of physical affection and intimacy.\n* Explore ways to maintain a healthy sexual dynamic that don't involve overtly sexualized behavior. This could include activities like sensual massage, intimate conversations, or romantic getaways.\n* Consider setting boundaries around your own behavior, such as avoiding situations that might trigger your hyper sexuality or seeking support from your partner when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n* Remember that it's okay to prioritize your partner's comfort and boundaries. It's not about suppressing your sexuality, but about being considerate of the other person's feelings and needs.\n\nRemember that relationships are about compromise and communication. It's essential to prioritize your partner's feelings and needs while also being honest about your own desires and boundaries.

Since you mentioned he's a kind and loving person, that's a great starting point.

Be open about what you're comfortable with and what you're not. This will help clear up any misunderstandings and create a sense of security.\n2. **Focus on emotional intimacy**: Since you mentioned he has a high emotional quotient, focus on building a deep emotional connection. Share your feelings, listen actively, and show empathy and understanding towards each other.\n3. **Find common interests**: Discover hobbies, passions, or activities you both enjoy doing together. This will help create shared experiences and memories, which can strengthen your bond.\n4. **Show appreciation and gratitude**: Express your gratitude for each other's positive qualities and actions. Acknowledge and appreciate the things your partner does for you and your relationship.\n5. **Compromise and flexibility**: Be willing to compromise and adapt to each other's needs and preferences. This will help you navigate differences and find common ground.\n6. **Take things slow**: Don't rush into things. Take time to get to know each other, and don't feel pressured to have a \"perfect\" relationship. Focus on building a strong foundation, and the rest will follow.\n7. **Seek counseling or therapy**: If needed, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor. This can provide a safe space to discuss challenges and work through issues together.\n\nRemember, happiness in a marriage comes from a combination of factors, including communication, trust, and mutual respect. It's not about being \"in love\" at the beginning, but about building a strong and loving relationship over time.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of small, everyday gestures. Small acts of kindness, surprise gifts, and thoughtful notes can go a long way in keeping the spark alive and showing your partner that you care.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Make sure you're both relatively calm and not stressed or tired.\n2. **Start with a positive tone**: Begin by acknowledging your girlfriend's strengths and expressing your appreciation for her in general. This will help set a positive tone for the conversation.\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you're awful with finances,\" say \"I've noticed that we've been struggling with our finances lately, and I'm worried about our future.\" This way, you're expressing your concerns and emotions without placing blame.\n4. **Focus on the impact, not the person**: Explain how your girlfriend's financial decisions are affecting you and your relationship, rather than attacking her personally. For example, \"I feel anxious when we're constantly living paycheck to paycheck, and I worry about our future security.\"\n5. **Avoid being accusatory or critical**: Refrain from making statements that start with \"you always\" or \"you never.\" These can come across as judgmental and defensive. Instead, use specific examples and focus on the behavior, not the person.\n6. **Offer help and support**: Let your girlfriend know that you're willing to help her develop better financial habits and that you're committed to working together to find solutions. You could say, \"I'm happy to help you create a budget and track our expenses. I think it would really help us get a better handle on our finances.\"\n7. **Listen actively**: Make sure to listen to your girlfriend's perspective and concerns. Acknowledge her feelings and validate her experiences. This will help her feel heard and understood, which can reduce defensiveness.\n8. **Collaborate on a plan**: Work together to create a plan to address the financial issues. This could include setting financial goals, creating a budget, and identifying areas where you can cut back.\n\nExample script:\n\n\"Hey [girlfriend's name], can we talk about our finances? I love you and appreciate all the amazing things you do, but I've been feeling really stressed about our financial situation lately. I think it's affecting our relationship and our future together. I'd like to help you create a budget and track our expenses. I know it's not easy, but I think it would really help us get a better handle on things. What do you think? Can we work on this together?\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to have an open and honest conversation, not to \"win\" an argument or change your girlfriend's behavior overnight.

We found out she was 2 months pregnant with her ex\u2019s child early on into dating (he completely ghosted her upon finding out about the pregnancy and wanted nothing to do with the child and hasn\u2019t been around since; child is 3 months old). When she found out she told me it was completely okay and understandable if I wanted to stop seeing each other as this was very unexpected. I have cared for this girl for over 2 years (we were friends first) and I didn\u2019t want to lose her. I wanted to be there for her and this child and be the father in every way (except biologically). We\u2019ve had some issues in the relationship (honestly because I\u2019ve done some pretty stupid things) that have led to disagreements. The last one we had was the day before her birthday (4 days before the baby was born).\n\nSince then my girlfriend has been distant. She hasn\u2019t been affectionate at all, she doesn\u2019t seem to like when I touch her, sometimes she sleeps in the living room and keeps the baby with her vs coming into the room, and she just honestly looks dead behind her eyes when I tell her I love her. I know she loves me but she just looks sad and I\u2019m not sure how to approach this and fix it.\n\n\nEDIT: this is the stuff I\u2019ve done \u201cAs much as I hate to admit it, I haven\u2019t been the best partner. I\u2019ve entertained women flirting with me, I purchased explicit content of somebody I know personally from a certain website, and I\u2019ve hung out with an ex without telling her and the ex tried to make a move and put my girlfriend down. The last incident was a mess. I have another ex (let\u2019s call her L) that I dated all through middle school and most of high school. We split senior year and we stayed best friends. My gf was okay with the friendship (she knows L and knows she  has zero feelings for me and I her). Basically I keep in contact with the L\u2019s mom as well and she has always wanted us back together. I had (stupidly) told my L\u2019s mom in late January that if I thought my ex still felt that way about me I\u2019d try and get back with her. Well word got back to my girlfriend and she was really hurt.\u201d\n\nAlso stop saying I cheated because my girlfriend has even said that I have not.  I did fucked up shit that crossed boundaries, yes but I didn\u2019t cheat. When I entertained women I mean they flirted and I let them, when they asked about a number or taking it further, I told them I had a girlfriend. Buying the explicit content, I should\u2019ve thought that through. She said it\u2019s porn and doesn\u2019t bother her but not to purchase from people I know. Hanging out with my one ex, we met up for a drink. She attempted something and put my girlfriend down, but I shut her down and left. She said this bothered her but all I did was meet for a drink thinking it might be possible to remain friends. She said she wasn\u2019t a fan of it but I didn\u2019t do anything with her and  I didn\u2019t cheat. Same with the L situation.

You might not be able to make a significant amount, especially when you're already struggling with debt.\n\nHere are some alternative options that might help you get back on your feet:\n\n1. Freelance writing or editing: If you have writing or editing skills, consider offering your services on freelance platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or ProBlogger. You can also reach out to local businesses or websites directly to offer your services.\n2. Online surveys and gigs: Sign up with websites like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, or InboxDollars. While it won't make you rich, it's a way to earn some extra cash in your spare time.\n3. Selling unwanted items: Declutter your space and sell items you no longer need or use on platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. You can also have a yard sale or garage sale.\n4. Part-time job or gig work: Consider taking up a part-time job or gig work to supplement your income. You can search for job openings on job boards, or look for gig work on platforms like TaskRabbit, Uber Eats, or DoorDash.\n5. Sell handmade goods: If you have a talent for crafting or making things, consider selling your goods on platforms like Etsy or at local craft fairs.\n6. Pet-sitting or dog-walking: Offer pet-sitting or dog-walking services in your neighborhood. You can advertise on social media or use pet-sitting platforms like Rover.\n7. Tutoring or teaching: If you have expertise in a particular subject, consider offering tutoring or teaching services online or in-person.\n\nRemember, these options might not make you rich quickly, but they can help you earn some extra money to get back on your feet. Be cautious of any opportunities that seem too good to be true, and always do your research before investing your time or money.\n\nRegarding your debt, it's essential to prioritize paying off your credit card debt as soon as possible. Consider consolidating your debt or negotiating with your credit card company to see if they can offer any assistance. You can also seek the help of a credit counselor or financial advisor to develop a plan to get out of debt.\n\nLastly, try to avoid taking on more debt or making new financial commitments until you've got a better handle on your finances.

Here are some suggestions to make this proposal a memorable and successful one:\n\n1. **Approach her father before the proposal**: I understand your hesitation, but it's essential to have a conversation with him beforehand. You could explain your intentions and ask for his blessing. You might say something like, \"Hi, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I'm planning to propose to your daughter soon, and I'd love to have your blessing. I think you'll be happy to know that I'm serious about our relationship and committed to making her happy.\"\n2. **Plan a special moment with her father**: Use this opportunity to bond with him and create a special memory. You could take him out for a meal, watch a game together, or do something he enjoys. This will help him feel more comfortable with you and give you a chance to build a connection.\n3. **Keep it low-key, but meaningful**: Since her parents are visiting, you might want to avoid a grand, public proposal. Instead, plan a quiet, intimate moment that speaks to your relationship and your love for her. It could be a sunset dinner, a romantic walk, or a special activity that holds meaning for the two of you.\n4. **Involve her in the planning (a little)**: Share your proposal plan with her, but don't reveal the exact details. You could say, \"I have something special planned for us during the holidays, but I want to keep it a surprise. I'll give you a hint: it involves her parents.\" This will make her feel included and excited without ruining the surprise.\n5. **Be prepared for any reaction**: Her parents might have different expectations or concerns. Be open-minded, respectful, and patient. If they need time to process or discuss it among themselves, be willing to wait.\n6. **Consider a small, symbolic gesture**: After proposing, you could give her a small gift or token that represents your love and commitment. This could be a customized necklace, a special piece of jewelry, or a heartfelt letter expressing your feelings.\n7. **Be authentic and sincere**: Remember, the most important thing is to speak from your heart and be genuine. Your proposal should reflect your true feelings and the love you share with your girlfriend.\n\nAs a fellow dietitian, I'm sure you'll find creative ways to incorporate your shared profession into the proposal. Perhaps you could plan a special \"tasting menu\" with dishes that hold significance for your relationship or a customized dessert with a hidden message.\n\nLastly, don't stress too much about the details. Focus on the love and commitment you're about to make, and the rest will fall into place. Good luck, and I hope everything goes smoothly!",

As you got to know him better, your brain started to associate his scent with positive emotions and memories, making it more appealing to you.\n\nFast-forward to now, and your brain has re-evaluated M's scent in light of the negative emotions and experiences you've had with him.

    "sentence": "This will probably be long, sorry!\n\nI was raised and grew up in a very conservative very religious household and community. It was to the point where everything and everyone\u2019s purpose was to serve our religion and our community. I was homeschooled all the way up until college, and then the college I attended was a small school run by members of the same group. To say I was sheltered is very much an understatement.\n\nI met my husband there (another devout believer like me), we \u201cdated,\u201d which mostly consisted of attending prayer services together, until we finished school, and then we immediately married. I became a schoolteacher, and his work required occasional travel, but we made a happy life together never really leaving the confines of our community.\n\nA little over a year ago that was all turned upside down. My husband was offered a very high-paying job in the suburbs of a fairly major city. It would require him to travel a bit more, but we\u2019d be substantially better off. We talked about it and decided to do it, especially since there was also an opening at a school in the area where we were moving. \n\nSo we set it all up. He took the job, we bought a new house, and I was hired to teach at this new school. Once I started working there, I was hit with quite a bit of culture shock. All sorts of new ideas, people, and beliefs were coming at me quicker than I really had time to process. It was very overwhelming at first, especially since I\u2019d rarely ever had to deal with someone even outside of our religion. \n\nSo to shorten this up a little and get to my point, eventually I started to come around to question some of the things I\u2019d been taught and I\u2019d believed all growing up. Specifically, I met a male colleague who was just very different. He was charming, confident, witty, intelligent,  and (honestly) attractive, and he believed none of what I did. We had amazing discussions and debates during our shared lunch together. I realized eventually that I wasn\u2019t really sure how much of what I believed. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever really thought hard about it, and now that I was, I was questioning. I found myself talking about subjects I\u2019d never talked about, laughing at jokes that would have horrified previous me, but I also found myself happier than I was, even though I had thought I was happy.\n\nAll of this was, of course, without my husband\u2019s knowledge. He is, was, and always will be a true believer. Recently, it\u2019s made me think less of him, both intellectually and physically. On top of that, I think I also have feelings for my coworker. \n\nTl;dr\u2014To sum it all up, I\u2019m not really sure if my husband and I have anything in common beyond our religion, and meeting someone new has opened my eyes to that and to perhaps my being a different person than I thought I was even, and I\u2019m not sure what to do at all!",

It's a natural part of growth and self-discovery. It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on what you truly believe and what you're comfortable with.\n\nRegarding your feelings for your coworker, it's understandable that you're attracted to someone who is different from your husband and from your previous life. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're not committed to your marriage or that you're looking to cheat. It's possible that you're simply acknowledging a new aspect of yourself and your desires.\n\nAs for your husband, it's natural to feel a sense of disconnection when you're growing and changing, and your partner isn't. It's not necessarily a reflection of his worth as a person or a partner. It's possible that you're realizing that you've been living in a bubble, and now you're craving more intellectual and emotional stimulation.\n\nHere's what I want you to consider: what do you want for yourself? What kind of life do you want to lead? Are you happy with the life you have now, or do you feel like you're stuck? What are your values, and are they aligned with your husband's? Are there aspects of your faith that you still hold dear, or are you questioning the entire foundation?\n\nYou don't have to have all the answers right now. Take your time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and desires. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about how you're feeling. It's possible that he's not aware of the changes you're going through, and a conversation might help you both grow and understand each other better.\n\nRemember, you're not stuck in this situation. You have the power to create the life you want, and it's okay to take your time figuring out what that looks like.",

It's great that you're using job search platforms like Indeed and Glassdoor. Since you're having trouble finding jobs that require less experience, you might want to consider applying to companies that are known for hiring entry-level workers or those that offer internships.\n\nNow, about the whole \"3x rent\" income requirement thing... it can be a major hurdle, but there are some workarounds you could explore:\n\n1. Look for apartments that don't require 3x rent income: Some landlords or property managers might be more flexible, especially if the apartment complex is newer or has a lot of vacancies. You could try searching for apartments that specifically state they don't require a certain income level.\n2. Consider a roommate: Even if you can't find someone to split the rent with, you might be able to find someone to share a small space with. This could be a friend from college or someone you meet through a social media group or online forum. Just make sure you're clear about expectations and boundaries!\n3. Apply for government assistance: If you're eligible, you might be able to get assistance with rent through programs like Section 8 housing or other local initiatives. You can research these programs online or visit your local housing authority to learn more.\n4. Save up and negotiate: If you find an apartment you love, but it's just out of your budget, try negotiating with the landlord. Explain your situation and see if they're willing to work with you. You could also try saving up a bit more each month to get closer to the 3x rent requirement.\n5. Look into short-term rentals: You might be able to find a short-term rental (like a sublease or a month-to-month lease) that's more affordable. Just be aware that these options might not have all the amenities you're looking for.\n\nLastly, don't give up! It might take some time, but keep applying to jobs and exploring different options. You'll find something that works for you, and it's okay if it takes a little longer. Remember to take care of yourself during this process, too \u2013 it can be stressful, but you're not alone!\n\nHow do these suggestions sound?

    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear you're struggling with this. It's clear you care deeply about your fianc\u00e9e and the life you've built together. I'm here to offer some honest and nuanced advice.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that sexual attraction is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human relationships. It's not uncommon for people to experience fluctuations in sexual desire or to feel disconnected from their partner's physicality over time. However, the fact that you're feeling consistently turned off by the thought of intimacy with your fianc\u00e9e is a significant concern.\n\nBefore we dive into potential solutions, I want to emphasize that you've already taken a crucial step by acknowledging your feelings and being honest with yourself. It takes a lot of courage to confront this kind of vulnerability.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication is key**: Have an open and non-judgmental conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about your feelings. Be honest about your lack of attraction and the physical discomfort you're experiencing. It's essential to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, as your fianc\u00e9e may be feeling hurt or confused by your disconnection.\n2. **Explore the reasons behind your disconnection**: Reflect on what might be contributing to your lack of attraction. Is it the past infidelity? The lack of emotional intimacy? The pressure of being in a long-term relationship? Identifying the root cause can help you address the issue more effectively.\n3. **Rekindle emotional intimacy**: Focus on building emotional intimacy with your fianc\u00e9e. This can involve activities that promote connection, such as regular date nights, meaningful conversations, and shared hobbies. Strengthening your emotional bond might help rekindle your physical attraction.\n4. **Consider counseling**: Couples therapy can be an excellent way to address the underlying issues and work through your feelings together. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and find ways to rekindle the spark in your relationship.\n5. **Take responsibility for your actions**: While it's not your fianc\u00e9e's fault that you're feeling disconnected, it's essential to acknowledge that your past infidelity may have contributed to the current state of your relationship. Take ownership of your actions and work on rebuilding trust and commitment.\n6. **Be honest about your doubts**: If, after exploring the above options, you still feel like you're not compatible with your fianc\u00e9e on a physical level, it may be necessary to have an honest conversation about your doubts regarding the future of the relationship.\n\nRegarding your concerns about spending the rest of your life with someone you dread sex with, I want to emphasize that relationships are about more than just physical intimacy. You've built a life together, and you share a child. While sex is an important aspect of any relationship, it's not the only factor.\n\nUltimately, the decision to stay in the relationship or re-evaluate your commitment depends on your individual priorities and values. I encourage you to take your time, reflect on your feelings, and have open and honest conversations with your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and focus on building a stronger emotional connection before addressing the physical aspect of your relationship.",

It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and priorities.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your boyfriend's threat to break up with you if you go to Australia is not a healthy or mature response. It's understandable that he's struggling with the idea of a long-distance relationship, but it's not a reason to dictate your choices or compromise your goals. You deserve to pursue your dreams and aspirations without feeling pressured to sacrifice them for the sake of your relationship.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you're not being selfish by wanting to prioritize your own desires and goals. In fact, staying in a relationship that stifles your growth and happiness can be detrimental to both individuals involved. You have a unique opportunity to experience a new environment, culture, and education that can benefit your personal and professional development.\n\nThat being said, it's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Let him know that you value your relationship and the love you share, but you also need to prioritize your own goals and aspirations. It's possible that he may not be ready to accept the idea of a long-distance relationship, and that's okay. You deserve someone who supports and encourages you, even if it means being apart for a period.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Australia, it's essential to prepare yourself for the possibility of a breakup. It's not a guarantee, but it's a reality you should be prepared to face. You can take steps to maintain a healthy distance, stay connected through technology, and focus on building a fulfilling life in Australia.\n\nOn the other hand, if you choose to stay in the local university, you'll need to confront the reasons why you're staying, which may be due to fear, insecurity, or a sense of obligation. Be honest with yourself about your motivations and consider whether they align with your values and goals.\n\nUltimately, this is a decision that requires careful consideration and self-reflection. Take the time you need to weigh your options, and remember that you deserve to prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment.\n\nWhat do you think is the most significant factor influencing your decision, and what are your concerns about leaving or staying?",

Recognize that there's no such thing as a \"wrong\" choice, only choices that may have different outcomes. Now, let's get practical!\n\nHere are some tips to help you become more decisive:\n\n1. **Define your goals and priorities**: Before making a decision, clarify what's most important to you. What are your non-negotiables? What will bring you the most happiness and fulfillment? Write them down.\n2. **Gather information, but don't overdo it**: Don't get stuck in research mode. Set a time limit for gathering information, and then trust your instincts. Remember, you can't know everything, and overthinking can lead to analysis paralysis.\n3. **Weigh the pros and cons**: Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of each option. This will help you visualize the potential outcomes and make a more informed decision.\n4. **Practice mindfulness and self-reflection**: Take a step back, breathe, and ask yourself: \"What's driving my indecision?\" Is it fear, uncertainty, or something else? Acknowledge your emotions, and then refocus on your goals and priorities.\n5. **Use the 80/20 rule**: Often, 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts. Identify the most critical factors that will impact the outcome and focus on those.\n6. **Create a decision-making framework**: Establish a process that works for you, such as weighing the importance of each factor, considering the potential consequences, or using a simple pros-and-cons list.\n7. **Take calculated risks**: Remember that indecision can be a risk in itself. Sometimes, taking a calculated risk can lead to growth and learning, even if it doesn't yield the desired outcome.\n8. **Embrace the \"good enough\" principle**: Not every decision needs to be perfect. Sometimes, \"good enough\" is, well, good enough. Don't let perfectionism hold you back from making a decision.\n9. **Practice decision-making in low-stakes situations**: Start with small, low-stakes decisions, like what to wear or where to eat. As you become more comfortable, you'll build confidence in your decision-making abilities.\n10. **Celebrate your decisions**: Acknowledge and celebrate your decisions, even if they don't turn out as expected. This will help you build confidence and develop a growth mindset.\n\nRemember, becoming more decisive takes time and practice.

If they put their hands in their pockets, you do the same.  It creates an unconscious connection. \n\nAs for being in the classroom, don't worry about saying the right thing every time. Nobody really cares, most people are focusing on their own stuff. If you already know everything, you're in the wrong class, so don't be afraid to be wrong, you're there to learn, not impress the 30 some odd peers that you'll probably never see after graduation. \n\nDon't be afraid to laugh at yourself.

    "model_response": "I totally get it. Social anxiety can be super debilitating. First off, acknowledge that it's normal to feel nervous in social situations, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. It's great that you're acknowledging your struggles and willing to work on it.\n\nHere's a two-part approach to help you improve:\n\n1. **Gradual Exposure**: Start small. Begin with tiny, manageable steps to challenge your comfort zone. For instance:\n\t* Practice talking to one person, not a group, and start with a low-stakes conversation (e.g., asking about the weather or a shared interest).\n\t* Gradually increase the duration and frequency of these conversations.\n\t* When eating in public, start with small, low-pressure situations, like grabbing a coffee or snack with a friend.\n2. **Mindset Shift and Skills**: Focus on building your self-awareness, self-acceptance, and communication skills:\n\t* Practice mindfulness to recognize your thoughts and physical sensations when you're feeling anxious. Acknowledge them, but don't let them dictate your actions.\n\t* Work on reframing negative self-talk and replacing it with positive affirmations. You are capable and deserving of connection.\n\t* Improve your active listening skills by focusing on others, asking open-ended questions, and showing genuine interest.\n\t* Consider joining a social group, club, or online community related to a hobby or interest. This can help you connect with like-minded people in a low-pressure environment.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it's okay to take it slow. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, and be patient with your progress. Celebrate small victories, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter setbacks.\n\nLastly, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional or a trusted adult, like a teacher or counselor, to help you develop a personalized plan and provide ongoing support.\n\nYou got this!",

She says I don't pay enough attention to what she is saying, and when I'm sober I'm super attentive to her.\n\nI don't understand what she means by this so we argue about this for some time. This weed issue has come up before. She got into a fight with my best friend over weed because of something I can't remember. She has complained about me smelling like smoke before as well.\n\nAnyway, back to the fight. We argue and end up compromising that I should only smoke 2 days a week. She started with smoking every other day but 2 days is where we compromised. So here is my issue. I've never asked her to chance anything. Yet she is asking me?\n\nWhat is going on here? Am I over reacting? Thank you for the input.\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend asked me to stop smoking weed for at least 2 days a week. I think she might be trying to manipulate and change me. Advice please?",
    "human_response": "Your girl isn't even an adult yet but is trying to help you grow up.",
    "model_response": "I'm glad you're seeking outside perspective on this issue. It's natural to feel frustrated when someone asks you to change your habits without you asking them to compromise in return.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your girlfriend has expressed concerns about your weed use and its impact on your behavior around her. It's not just about the fact that you're smoking; it's about how it affects your interactions with her. You can't dismiss her feelings by saying she's just being controlling or manipulative.\n\nThat being said, it's reasonable for you to feel frustrated when you don't feel like you're getting a fair deal. You're willing to compromise and cut back on your smoking, but she's not asking you to make any significant changes in return. This imbalance can lead to feelings of resentment and unfairness.\n\nHere's what you might consider: instead of focusing solely on the fact that she's asking you to change, try to understand what's driving her concerns. What specific behaviors or actions does she perceive as a result of your weed use? Is it really about the fact that you're not paying attention to her, or is there something else at play?\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about this. Ask her to elaborate on what specifically bothers her, and listen actively to her response. Try to understand her perspective without getting defensive. You can also express your feelings and concerns, but do it in a non-accusatory way.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and mutual understanding. If you're willing to work together to find a solution that works for both of you, you might be able to find a more balanced arrangement. However, if you feel like your girlfriend is only looking out for her own interests and not willing to meet you halfway, it might be a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nLastly, it's essential to recognize that you can't change someone else's behavior or opinions. You can only control your own actions and reactions. If you feel like your girlfriend is trying to manipulate or control you, it might be a sign that the relationship is unhealthy. You deserve to be in a relationship where both parties respect and prioritize each other's feelings and needs.",

When I talk to people, I find myself often go into a \"critical mode\" to suggest how something can be improved.

In the case of my girlfriend, she thinks I'm always trying to prove her wrong whenever I suggest an alternative, which stresses her out.

    "model_response": "I totally get it! It's great that you have high standards and want to help others improve. However, you're right that the way you're approaching it might be coming across as critical, which can be alienating. Here's a suggestion: instead of focusing on what's not working, try framing your suggestions as \"ideas for growth\" or \"ways to build on what's already going well.\" This can help shift the tone from criticism to collaboration.\n\nWhen you do suggest something, try to start with a positive statement, acknowledging what's working well, and then gently build on that. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I really appreciate how you've been handling [specific task/project]. One thing that might take it to the next level is [specific suggestion]. What do you think?\"\n\nOr:\n\n\"I love the effort you're putting into [project/initiative]. Have you considered [alternative approach]? I think it could help us achieve our goals more efficiently.\"\n\nBy framing your suggestions as ideas for growth, you're showing that you're invested in the person's success and willing to work together to find a solution. This approach can help your girlfriend feel more comfortable and less defensive.\n\nAnother tip is to use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For instance, instead of saying \"You could do this better,\" say \"I've noticed that in similar situations, I've found [alternative approach] works well. Maybe we could explore that option together?\"\n\nLastly, be mindful of your body language and tone. Make eye contact, smile, and use a gentle, open tone. This will help convey that you're coming from a place of support and collaboration, rather than criticism.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have high standards, but it's also important to prioritize the other person's feelings and perspective. By adopting this approach, you can have more productive and respectful conversations that focus on growth and improvement, rather than criticism.",

As our relationship grew, it feels as if we have grown apart. He spends all of his free time playing video games. I find myself always cooking and cleaning, even after being gone for 12 hours a day with work and school. If i don\u2019t cook for him, he eats out. He doesn\u2019t plan for us to go on dates, won\u2019t go to the gym with me and walks away when I\u2019m talking about something I\u2019m interested in if he doesn\u2019t like it.

I want to do fun things with him and it would help a lot if he could plan things for us, but it\u2019s just in one ear and out the other.\nHe is bad at expressing how he feels, so he rarely compliments me, or tells me he loves me.

It's essential to acknowledge and validate your emotions before trying to move forward.\n2. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being by getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. This can help improve your mood and reduce stress.\n3. **Create new routines and connections**: As you've moved away, it's natural to feel disconnected from your friend.

Don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over\" the loss by a certain time or according to a specific timeline.\n\nRemember, it's not about forgetting your friend, but about finding ways to integrate the loss into your life and move forward in a positive direction.

Don't take it personally and don't put too much pressure on them to maintain the same level of friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, it's great that you're excited about your job and the opportunities it's presenting.

Focus on nurturing the relationships that are truly important to you, and don't feel guilty about it.\n\nRemember, it's okay to grow and evolve as individuals.

This will help you stick to your commitment and also help your girlfriend understand that you're not just making it up or abandoning her.\n4. **Find alternatives to solo activities**: Instead of saying you want to go fishing with buddies, suggest doing something that still allows you to spend time together, like going for a walk or having a picnic. This way, you're still getting some alone time, but you're also spending quality time together.\n5. **Involve her in the process**: Encourage your girlfriend to join you in your solo activities, or find activities you can do together that you both enjoy. This will help her feel included and valued, reducing the likelihood of her feeling left out or insecure.\n6. **Seek compromise**: Be willing to find middle ground and compromise on your alone time. If she's not comfortable with you going fishing with friends, maybe you can find a different activity that you both enjoy, like playing a sport or attending a concert.\n7. **Monitor and adjust**: Pay attention to how your girlfriend responds to your alone time requests. If she continues to be clingy or resistant, it may be necessary to re-evaluate the relationship and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, relationships involve compromise and understanding. It's essential to find a balance between your needs and your girlfriend's needs. By communicating openly and honestly, setting boundaries, and seeking compromise, you can work towards finding a solution that works for both of you.",

As far as options I can use and lower interest and not get COMPLETELY screwed by Fed Loan Servicing?       \nI have about $10,000 left to pay.  I really can't make the payments, and have been in forbearance mode for a couple years.  I graduated in 2010, and was supposed to start repaying in 2011.  I made a couple payments, but then have been on and off of unemployment for the past couple of years.",
    "human_response": "You can only be in forbearance a maximum of 36 months total, so it sounds like you're near exhausting this as an option. Income Based Repayment will definitely lower your monthly payments, but you need to be aware that it extends the life of the loan to 25 years AND you have to provide verification of income annually. That means as your income changes, your payments will change up or down depending on what you're earning that year. Because it's a longer loan, you will pay a butt-load more in interest. The good-ish news is any amount left on your loan at the end of 25 years is forgiven. The bad-ish news is the forgiven amount is taxable income, so be as prepared as possible.\n\nIBR is fab because your payments will never be more than 15% of your discretionary income. \n\nTo qualify for IBR, you will need to prove partial financial hardship. As you've been on and off unemployment, you should be good with just documentation of that. But if you're near exhausting your unemployment benefits, you can register with a temp agency.\n\nOne other thing - if you are married and your spouse has student loan debt too, BOTH spouse's loans and both spouse's incomes are considered in calculating what your new monthly payment amount will be under IBR.  \n\nYou can apply for IBR through your servicer or studentloans.gov. The feds are pushing the IBR plan pretty hard lately because it gives more people a chance to pay back something on their loans and avoid default. \n\nLoan consolidation is another option, but check with your servicer first to see if the savings on monthly payments is affordable for you.\n\n(Disclosure - I am a default prevention specialist at a for-profit school)",
    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear you're struggling with your student loan payments. It's understandable that you're looking for help and guidance. I'll do my best to provide you with some options and advice.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're aware of your situation and seeking help. Being proactive can make a big difference. Since you're already in forbearance, let's explore some options to potentially lower your interest rates and make your payments more manageable.\n\n1. Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plans: You might be eligible for IDR plans, which can cap your monthly payments at 10-20% of your discretionary income. You'll need to reapply for IDR plans every year, and your payments will be recalculated based on your updated income and family size.\n2. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF): Since you graduated in 2010, you might be eligible for PSLF. You'll need to work in a qualifying public service job (non-profit, government, or military) and make 120 qualifying payments while working full-time. After that, the remaining balance might be forgiven.\n3. Teacher Loan Forgiveness: If you're working in a public school or a 501(c)(3) organization, you might be eligible for teacher loan forgiveness. You can apply for forgiveness after teaching for five consecutive years, and up to $17,500 of your Direct Loans might be forgiven.\n4. Refinancing: You might be able to refinance your federal loans with a private lender, which could potentially lower your interest rate. However, be cautious, as refinancing federal loans to a private lender will mean giving up some borrower benefits, such as IDR plans and PSLF.\n5. Federal Loan Consolidation: Consolidating your federal loans can simplify your payments and potentially lower your interest rate. However, be aware that consolidation can also extend the repayment period, which might not be ideal for your situation.\n\nTo get started, I recommend reaching out to your federal loan servicer to discuss your options. They can help you determine which plans you're eligible for and guide you through the application process.\n\nAdditionally, consider speaking with a student loan counselor or a non-profit credit counseling agency, such as the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC). They can provide personalized guidance and help you develop a plan to manage your debt.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your financial situation and make informed decisions. Be prepared to provide documentation and proof of income, employment, and financial hardship to support your applications.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out to your federal loan servicer or a student loan counselor if you have any questions or concerns. They're there to help you navigate this process and find a solution that works for you.\n\nKeep in mind that it's a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on making progress, not perfection. You got this!",

    "sentence": "So heres the thing, I work in a warehouse, specifically I used to work in shipping, but now I'm more of a tech girl. And I liked the shipping guys, but there is one coworker in particular this post is about. For these purposes we'll call him Jason.\n\nJason isn't necessarily a bad guy, hes funny and nice but the problem is he kind of has a.....odd personality. He was prior service military, so he doesn't really have a filter when it comes to saying stuff and he seems to be very up close and personal when he talks to people. But very likeable guy, but my biggest issue with him was that I thought he wanted to date me and that was why he talked to me so much.\n\nWell, I was talking to one of of my coworkers at lunch. And we started talking about our lives. And one thing led to another. And I said 'I mean, Jason's kind of a creep.\"\n\nWell, I see her face go 'Uh oh.\" And then I turned around.\n\nAnd well the breakroom is connected to one of the entrances. And it just so happened as soon as I said that, Jason actually walked through the door. And heard me say that.\n\nWell, he seemed to be okay, he obviously paused when he heard that, but he walked away so I figured he didn't take it personal.\n\nWell a week goes by, and it was a really quiet week, and I couldn't figure out why. And then when I got to the weekend, I realized Jason did not ONCE try to talk to me. Usually he would ask me how my day was, but he wasn't anymore.\n\nI mean yeah I felt like he could be a creep at times, but I just wish he would tone it down, I didn't want to stop talking to him completely.\n\nSo the next week I try to say Hi to him because I felt bad for saying that about him to his face. And I can't find him anywhere. But I talk to all the other shipping gremlins. And they're all saying how Jason has been reserved for the past two weeks. He doesn't tell jokes anymore, usually he would tell 'Would you rathers' to everyone. But he hadn't done that in two weeks. All he did was focus on work, go to the gym and go home.\n\nAnother week goes by, and I noticed whenever I would walk to say hi to my friends from Shipping, Jason would get a really uncomfortable look on his face before he would walk away.\n\nAgain, another week goes by and hes still not really talking to anyone. He even deactivated his facebook and got off social media. I know this because he had a group chat with all of us in it on facebook messenger where he would share memes that he found funny. But then next thing we know the group chat was shut down.\n\nI mean he's not a bad guy, its just that sometimes he comes off as a creeper, I know he's probably a little mad about being called that, but I didn't want to stop talking to him completely, I just wanted him to back off a little and give me some space. But now hes just giving me too much space.\n\nI just felt like he could go over the top with socializing and just wish he could tone it down. But with the way hes been for the past few weeks, its almost like he only has the two moods, over the top and excitable or quiet and reserved.\n\nI want to apologize but my work schedule is usually busy, and he won't hang out with anyone outside of work.\n\nBut at the same time I don't want to apologize because he was just TOO excitable for me and I felt like he could back off a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Felt like my coworker was coming on too strong, called him a creep to his face, but now hes isolating himself and won't talk to anyone and now I feel like I may have hurt him.",

There's no way he can read your mind and know all the qualifiers you're saying here and what you \"really meant\" when you called him kind of a creep.  There's no way a reasonable man would hear a woman in the workplace call him a creep and think, \"oh, I should just talk to her a little less, but otherwise, it's all good.\"\n\nMaybe you think he's gone too far in keeping to himself, but again, this is a workplace, he may be concerned about being in good standing at his job and not making unintended waves.  It's not like he wonders or suspects he might be making someone uncomfortable at work, so should he change his behavior?  He now knows he is.  He heard you call him a creep with his own ears.\n\nI know you didn't mean for him to hear you, but it happened and he's adjusted his behaviors accordingly.  He can't read your mind.  Honestly, I'm getting vibes that the real factor here is you don't want to feel bad about him overhearing you, and his adjusted behaviors are making you feel bad, and it wouldn't make you feel as bad if he magically knew he didn't have to change this much.  But still you punctuate with, \"but I also don't want to apologize \\[and clear up this misunderstanding\\] because his behavior is enough of a problem that I shouldn't clear anything up.\"  Confusing messaging here for sure.",
    "model_response": "Wow, what a complex situation! I can understand why you'd feel torn about this. On one hand, you didn't want Jason to be too forward or overbearing, but on the other hand, you didn't mean to hurt his feelings.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that you were honest about your feelings, which takes courage. However, it's clear that your words had a significant impact on Jason. It's understandable that he's taken it personally and is now withdrawing from social interactions.\n\nBefore apologizing, I'd like to suggest taking a step back and reflecting on your motivations. Were you genuinely concerned about Jason's behavior, or was it more about your own discomfort with his over-the-top personality? If it's the latter, it might be helpful to acknowledge that and work on developing empathy for Jason's feelings.\n\nRegarding the apology, it's understandable that you're hesitant given your busy schedule. However, it's possible to send a simple, sincere message expressing your regret for hurting his feelings. You could say something like, \"Hey Jason, I wanted to reach out and apologize for what I said about you being a creep. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, and I realize now that my words were thoughtless. I value our working relationship and would like to move forward in a positive way. If you're willing, I'd love to talk more about this and clear the air.\"\n\nRemember that an apology doesn't have to mean you're admitting fault or taking responsibility for Jason's behavior. It's about acknowledging the impact of your words and expressing a desire to make amends.\n\nLastly, it's essential to recognize that people's boundaries and comfort levels vary greatly. If Jason is genuinely struggling with social interactions, it might be helpful for him to develop strategies to manage his energy and communication style. Perhaps you could offer support and encouragement in a non-intrusive way, while also respecting his boundaries.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being in this situation. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own comfort level, but it's also important to be kind and empathetic towards others.",

Are they based on personal experiences, societal norms, or learned behaviors? Recognize how your biases might be influencing your opinions. Challenge yourself to question these biases and consider alternative perspectives.\n2. **Seek diverse perspectives**: Engage with people who have different views and experiences. This can be done through books, podcasts, documentaries, or conversations with friends and family. Be open-minded and willing to listen without becoming defensive.\n3. **Practice self-reflection**: Regularly take time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Ask yourself:\n\t* What are my underlying motivations for holding this opinion?\n\t* Is it based on facts or assumptions?\n\t* Is it serving me or holding me back?\n\t* What are the potential consequences of my opinion?\n4. **Seek out new information**: Stay curious and keep learning.

    "model_response": "Paying to attend a wedding is not uncommon, especially for close family members or friends. However, $175 per guest is indeed on the higher side. While it's not unheard of, it's not typical either.\n\nIn general, wedding invitation prices vary greatly depending on the formality, location, and guest list size. A more common range for formal weddings is around $50-$100 per guest. For smaller, more intimate gatherings, it's not uncommon to see prices in the $20-$50 range.\n\nAs for the cash gifts, it's also worth noting that many couples prefer cash gifts or contributions to their honeymoon fund instead of traditional gifts. This is often because they can use the money towards their new life together, rather than accumulating more possessions.\n\nConsidering your family member's wedding is your first, it's understandable you might be unsure. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Discuss your concerns with your family member: Have an open and honest conversation with your family member about your concerns regarding the cost. They might be willing to negotiate or offer alternative options.\n2. Consider the overall experience: Think about the value you'll get from attending the wedding. Will it be a memorable experience, or will the cost outweigh the benefits? Weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.\n3. Set a budget: Determine how much you're comfortable spending and stick to it. You don't have to attend the wedding if it's outside your budget.\n4. Look for alternatives: If the cost is indeed too high, consider attending a smaller, more low-key celebration or even a virtual celebration (if available).\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your financial well-being and make decisions that align with your values and budget.",

Your friend might already be feeling overwhelmed and uncertain, so it's crucial to create a safe and non-judgmental space for her to open up.\n\nHere are some suggestions on what you could say to your friend:\n\n1.

Share your own experiences and insights: As someone who's known your friend for a long time, you might have valuable insights to share. Share your own experiences, concerns, or lessons learned from your own relationships or observations.\n4. Emphasize the importance of self-reflection: Encourage your friend to take time to reflect on her feelings, thoughts, and motivations. Suggest that she consider talking to a trusted adult, such as a counselor or a trusted family member, to get a different perspective.\n5. Offer support: Let your friend know that you're there to support her, no matter what she decides. Reassure her that you'll be there to help her through the process, but also be clear that you won't support her decision to rush into something that might not be in her best interest.\n\nSome additional resources you could share with your friend include:\n\n* The \"Lemon Clot Essay\" (as you mentioned) - a humorous and relatable essay on the importance of thinking carefully about big decisions.\n* Online resources and articles about the importance of waiting before having children, such as this article from The Cut.\n\nRemember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and avoid being judgmental or critical.

We were even talking about what music we listened to when we were teenagers and how we both tried to be cool, and he said that he never cared what other people listened to, if it made them happy that's what mattered.

I\u2019ve been really good at fixating on things and working hard to achieve them but over the last few months I\u2019ve noticed that I have sudden bursts of energy and motivation where I come up with plenty of ideas/goals/thing I wish to do (both in my personal life as well as professional) but then the smallest distraction happens and I find it hard to commit to them. For instance, I had a sudden urge to start dancing more, learning dance, opening a dance account etc. but then I was upset due to a personal issue for a few weeks and just kinda left it there. These disruptions keep happening and I feel like I don\u2019t really achieve anything. How to best deal with this? Sorry if I haven\u2019t done a good job at explaining this.",

    "model_response": "I totally get it! It sounds like you're struggling with focus and consistency, which can be really frustrating. First, take a deep breath and know that you're not alone in this struggle.\n\nTo overcome this, let's break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Set SMART goals**: Instead of having a vague goal like \"I want to start dancing more,\" try setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. For example, \"I will practice dancing for 30 minutes, 3 times a week, for the next 6 weeks.\" This will help you stay focused and track your progress.\n2. **Prioritize**: With your multiple goals and interests, it's essential to prioritize what's most important to you right now. Ask yourself, \"What's the one thing I can commit to doing consistently, even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day?\" Focus on that one thing, and then revisit your other goals later.\n3. **Create a \"stop doing\" list**: Identify the distractions that derail your progress and make a conscious effort to avoid them. For instance, if you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media, try deleting the apps or setting a timer to limit your usage.\n4. **Schedule it in**: Treat your goals like any other important appointment. Schedule dedicated time for your goals, and commit to showing up. Even 10-15 minutes a day can be beneficial.\n5. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if it's just showing up to your scheduled practice session. This will help you build momentum and motivation.\n6. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that setbacks are normal, and it's okay to take a break. Don't beat yourself up over missed sessions or lost momentum. Instead, learn from the experience and get back on track when you're ready.\n7. **Reflect and adjust**: Regularly reflect on your progress, and adjust your approach as needed. Ask yourself what worked well, what didn't, and what you can improve.\n\nRemember, developing new habits and consistency takes time. Be patient, and don't give up. You got this!",

    "sentence": "Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for almost 2 years now.\n\nHe has a female friend who he got close to a few months before we got close. As our relationship has progressed, I\u2019m getting more and more uncomfortable with their friendship. Just to clarify, they are only friends (at least from my boyfriend\u2019s perspective). I feel sometimes he almost forgets about me when she is around and how close they are physically also makes me uncomfortable. \n\nSome examples include:\n-them almost (we debate whether or not it actually happened) grinding at a club and stopping when I caught sight of them. She stepped away when she saw me. He apologised and we dropped it. \n-They\u2019re super cuddly and huggy - for example it\u2019s not uncommon to see his arm around her if they\u2019re sitting together. In contrast, physical touch is my love language and to me, he used to say that he struggles with physical affection. I\u2019ll admit that it stung to see him do with her what I would wanted. \n-He recently was wrapping a scarf around her neck. He was doing it for her which I found rather intimate. \n-She had her head rested on his shoulder when we were out bowling. \n-Walking in a group, they tend to gravitate towards each other even when I don\u2019t have other people to talk to. Situations like this make me feel kind of forgotten by my BF. \n\nWe recently had an argument where I felt he prioritised her over me. She was being disrespectful (which he agreed with but said he didn\u2019t have an issue with it. He even went out of his way to tell her he wasn\u2019t mad at her but other friends were). He wanted me to leave his place because he had some work to get done. She asked for a favour (that would have taken her only 10 minutes to do herself) and he agreed very easily despite me and friends advising him not to enable certain behaviours of hers. He postponed his work to run her errand for her. She was disrespectful to me and his other friends and hadn\u2019t apologised yet even. I feel he disregarded my feelings and went out of his way to do something for her which she didn\u2019t deserve at that point and which he didn\u2019t want to do for me. \n\nInitially I wasn\u2019t too bothered by their behaviour but it\u2019s kind upsetting me after seeing him wrapping a scarf around her. It feels so intimate and I don\u2019t like he shares this physical intimacy with someone else. I didn\u2019t want to project my feelings onto their friendship but I\u2019m feeling too uncomfortable to just suppress it. I feel their physical intimacy (when he supposedly had to learn how to be physically affectionate with me) feels disrespectful to our relationship. I don\u2019t know if this is just jealousy or this level of intimacy is too much between friends. He\u2019s just always with her and there\u2019s so much touching. \n\nHow would you feel if this was your partner? Is this something I just have to deal with? Am I being unreasonable? If I do talk to him, what kind of boundaries do I even have the right to establish in his friendships? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend is very physically intimate with female friend which makes me uncomfortable. He recently disregarded my feelings about her to run an errand for her when he was advised not to even by other friends. This made me feel second to his friendship. Is it just me being unreasonable or do I get to have a say in how he can act with friends?\n\nEdit: Does it change things if most of the time they spend together is in group settings with me included as well? It\u2019s not to say he\u2019s only affectionate with her. He\u2019s undoubtedly more physically intimate with than with her. But I feel certain things should only be for your partner. He\u2019s otherwise a great boyfriend very considerate and open to listening but I feel some things you shouldn\u2019t have to tell your partner not to do and this feels like one of them. But how much slack can I cut him until it feels like he doesn\u2019t care enough about my feelings to even notice that these things are inappropriate without me telling him?",
    "human_response": "I'm sorry this is happening to you. \n\nWhile I'm pretty affectionate with most of my male friends this seems off even to me. \n\nHe's not cheating, but it definitely seems he's harboring some pretty deep romantic feelings for her. Since he's not willing to put any distant between them two for the sake of your relationship, I would end this.\n\nBe abundantly clear about why.",
    "model_response": "I can understand why you're feeling uncomfortable and upset about the situation. It's natural to feel possessive and protective of your partner, especially when it comes to physical intimacy. It's not just about jealousy, but about the boundaries and respect you feel your partner should have for your relationship.\n\nFirstly, it's not unreasonable to expect your partner to prioritize your feelings and needs in their friendships. You're not asking him to cut ties with his friend, but rather to be mindful of how his behavior makes you feel. It's essential to communicate your concerns with your partner and set clear boundaries.\n\nWhen you do have the conversation, it's crucial to focus on how his behavior affects you, rather than attacking or accusing him. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example, \"I feel uncomfortable when I see you being physically intimate with your friend, it makes me feel like I'm not your priority.\" or \"I feel hurt when you prioritize her over me, it makes me feel like my needs are not being met.\"\n\nRegarding the boundaries, you have every right to establish what you're comfortable with in your partner's friendships. You can discuss what you feel is appropriate and what makes you uncomfortable. It's essential to remember that your partner is not your possession, but you do have a right to know how he interacts with others.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your partner is not just with his friend, but also with you. Since most of the time they spend together is in group settings, it's possible that his behavior is not intentional, but rather a result of being in a social setting. However, it's still important to address your concerns and set clear boundaries.\n\nLastly, it's great that your partner is considerate and open to listening. Use this as an opportunity to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and needs. Remember that communication is key in any relationship, and it's okay to address uncomfortable topics.\n\nRemember, you're not being unreasonable to feel this way, and it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and needs in your relationship.",

    "sentence": "tl;dr: My partner wants me to pay for the prescription cat food our vet prescribed because he thinks I overreacted to the cat pooping in the bathtub and in the dining room over the course of multiple days for the last month. I feel unappreciated. How do I handle this?\n\nMy (41 NB) cat died earlier in the spring at the age of 13 after his kidney failed. He was my cat from before I met my partner (29 M) but quickly won my partner over because he was really one the sweetest, gentlest cats I have ever had. The problem was, in his last year of life, vet bills really racked up, into the thousands, largely pocketed by me because I was really unwilling to part from him until I was sure it was his time, and it was pretty clear when it was time to let him go.\n\nMy partner initially didn't want to adopt a new cat right away because we still have an elderly dog we nearly lost this year as well, he's going back to school and so it has been a financial burden keeping him alive, and I was fine with that because I was still grieving my cat anyway. Late this spring, though, he started really missing having a cat around, so he and I went to a local rescue and fell in love with a little tabby-calico mix (1 1/2 F) who came from a hoarding situation.\n\nOverall, she's been a great cat, but the one thing I've struggled with over the month we've had her is that she poops in the bathtub and that it isn't solid. This combination led me to wonder if it is medical since I had a cat when I was a kid who did this when she had a UTI.\n\nMy partner thought I was overreacting and didn't want me to take her to the vet, but I insisted after she pooped in the middle of the dining room floor.\n\nAt the vet, we found out she has no parasites, but he wants us to try a combination of behavioral changes (such as adding an additional litter box) and a prescription cat food to see if it will clear up the consistency of the poop.\n\nWhen I told my partner, he was frustrated and told me that I'm making a deal over something that's minor. The thing is, with him working third shift and going to school, cleaning the house usually falls to me, which is something I don't mind since he does a lot of cooking. But I'm feeling really resentful that he sees this as no big deal since I'm usually the one who cleans up poop in the bathtub at least once a day.\n\nHe told me that he would agree to clean up the poop, which is something he can't seriously commit to because I work from home and would have to be in a home with cat poop in the open and even shower in it if I were to just leave it for him all the time. He got frustrated and told me I'm paying for the prescription food if I think it's so necessary.\n\nI'm feeling very upset right now because I really don't think it's normal for a cat to poop this much outside the litterbox but I feel very unsupported in trying to get her to stop, and I feel this is part of a larger issue about usually being the one who doesn't minimalize when something is wrong with the animals.\n\nHow can I approach this that both acknowledges his anxiety about finances while also pushing that a cat acting this way is not normal medically or behaviorally? I don't want to potentially spend 15 years with a cat that poops everywhere, especially if it can be easily corrected.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not thinking of getting rid of the cat. That's not on the table because it's not her fault. But I also don't think simply letting her poop everywhere is an acceptable solution.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure how clear I made it because I'm a little upset right now, but I think my frustration comes around his minimization of the cat's issue and his ultimatum that I would need to pay for it all. This is a common pattern for him with money: completely panicking over unexpected expenses and picking anxious fights about it.",

This will help you build connections and find common ground with others.\n4. **Practice humor**: Watch comedians, read funny articles, and try to understand what makes people laugh. Develop your own sense of humor and learn to find the humor in everyday situations.\n5. **Be willing to take risks**: Step out of your comfort zone and engage in activities that challenge you, like public speaking, group projects, or volunteering.

Put away your phone, make eye contact, and use positive body language to show you're interested in the conversation.\n7. **Find your inner \"why\"**: Connect with your purpose and passions. When you're excited about something, it's easier to share that enthusiasm with others and make them excited too.\n8. **Seek feedback and learn from others**: Ask people you trust to give you feedback on your social interactions. Learn from their observations and work on areas where you can improve.\n9. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you put yourself out there, the more comfortable you'll become. Start small, like striking up conversations with strangers or sharing your thoughts in online forums.\n10. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Developing these skills takes time, and it's okay to make mistakes. Be gentle with yourself, and remember that it's a journey, not a destination.\n\nRemember, becoming the person who effortlessly makes others laugh or has exciting stories to share is not about being someone you're not. It's about being authentic, building connections with others, and having a willingness to grow and learn.",

    "human_response": "Get each of them lottery scratch offs, and hope no one has a gambling addiction you don't know about",
    "model_response": "I totally get it! Finding the perfect gift for a large number of family members can be overwhelming, especially when you want to make sure each person feels special.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the budget aspect. Set a realistic budget for yourself, and stick to it. Consider allocating a specific amount per person, and make sure you're comfortable with that number. This will help you avoid overspending and reduce financial stress.\n\nNow, let's talk about finding the right gifts without breaking the bank. Here are some tips to help you out:\n\n1. **Make a list, check it twice**: Take some time to think about each person's interests, hobbies, and preferences. Make a list of potential gift ideas for each family member. This will help you stay focused and avoid impulse buys.\n2. **Personalize, but don't overdo it**: You don't need to break the bank on expensive, personalized gifts. Consider small, thoughtful gestures like a handwritten note, a family photo, or a customized keychain. These can be meaningful and cost-effective.\n3. **Batch similar gifts**: If you have multiple family members with similar interests or hobbies, consider buying similar gifts in bulk. This can help you save time and money.\n4. **Shop smart**: Look for sales, discounts, and promotions. Take advantage of online deals, coupons, and cashback apps to stretch your budget.\n5. **Experiences over material gifts**: Consider gifting experiences like tickets to a concert, a movie night, or a fun activity. These can be more meaningful and create lasting memories without breaking the bank.\n6. **DIY or crafty gifts**: Get creative and make something yourself! Homemade gifts, like baked goods, knitted items, or photo albums, can be thoughtful and cost-effective.\n7. **Gift cards**: Let's face it, gift cards can be a lifesaver. They allow the recipient to choose something they really want or need, and they're often more practical than physical gifts.\n\nTo avoid exhaustion, here are a few more tips:\n\n1. **Break it down into smaller tasks**: Divide your shopping list into smaller chunks, and focus on one or two gifts at a time. This will help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n2. **Make a plan**: Create a schedule for your shopping and gift-wrapping tasks. Set aside specific times for each activity, and take breaks when needed.\n3. **Ask for help**: If possible, consider enlisting the help of a family member or friend. This can make the process more enjoyable and share the workload.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your loved ones you care and are thinking of them. With a little planning, creativity, and patience, you can find the perfect gifts for each family member without wiping out your bank account or exhausting yourself.",

What isn't normal is his inflated sense that life is all about him. If it doesn't benefit him, he doesn't do it. I have been giving him the structure, guidance and direction that he has asked for, but he's not changing. His girlfriend has been on him about his poor hygiene, but he doesn't change.\nLately, he has become withdrawn and silent, and he is by himself a lot. He literally sleeps all day. Oh, and he's a compulsive liar, so we don't know if anything he tells us is truthful. He does have depression issues and some trauma. Those signs are easy to spot in him. What gives, if you know?",

However, it's concerning that despite your efforts, he's not making progress.\n\nIt's possible that his sense of entitlement and lack of motivation are linked to his depression and trauma. People with depression often feel hopeless and disconnected from others, which can lead to a sense of disconnection and disinterest in activities that don't benefit them directly. His compulsive lying could be a coping mechanism or a way to avoid accountability.\n\nGiven his history of trauma, it's likely that he's struggling to develop healthy coping mechanisms and boundaries. His withdrawal and silence could be a sign of emotional numbing, which is a common response to trauma.\n\nTo address this, I would recommend having an open and non-judgmental conversation with him. It's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging his struggles and expressing concern for his well-being. You might say something like:\n\n\"I care about you and want to support you, but I've noticed that you've been withdrawing and struggling with motivation. I'm worried about your well-being and want to help you find ways to cope with your feelings. Can you help me understand what's going on and how I can support you?\"\n\nIt's crucial to avoid blaming or criticizing him, as this could exacerbate the issue. Instead, focus on active listening and exploring ways to help him develop healthier habits and coping mechanisms. You might also consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to address his depression and trauma.\n\nRegarding his hygiene, it might be helpful to have a gentle and non-confrontational conversation with him about his personal habits. You could express your concern for his well-being and suggest that poor hygiene can impact his physical and emotional health. It's essential to avoid being critical or judgmental, as this could lead to defensiveness.\n\nRemember that your nephew is still developing his sense of identity and boundaries. It's essential to be patient, understanding, and supportive as he navigates his struggles. By providing a safe and non-judgmental space for him to open up, you can help him develop the skills and confidence he needs to overcome his challenges.",

Practice deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga to help manage your emotions.

This could include things like taking a warm bath, using a heating pad, or having a comforting drink. Having a plan in place can help you feel more in control and prepared.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself when you're having a bad day.

Find a common ground: Think about what you have in common with your neighbor. Do you both have the same favorite TV show or movie? Do you both like hiking or trying new restaurants? Use these common interests as a conversation starter. You can say something like, \"Hey, have you seen that new show on Netflix? I just binge-watched it over the weekend and loved it!\"\n\n2. Ask open-ended questions: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage your neighbor to share more about themselves. For example, \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" or \"What's your favorite part about living in this neighborhood?\"\n\n3. Share a personal anecdote: Share a funny or interesting story about yourself. This can help your neighbor feel more comfortable opening up to you. Just be sure to keep it light and relatable. For example, \"I tried a new recipe over the weekend and it was a total disaster! Have you ever had a cooking fail?\"\n\n4. Take the initiative to initiate a conversation: Don't wait for your neighbor to make the first move. Take the initiative to start a conversation. You can say something like, \"Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, have you tried that new coffee shop downtown? I heard great things about it.\"\n\n5. Be patient and genuine: Building a connection with someone takes time, so don't put too much pressure on yourself. Just be yourself, be genuine, and let the conversation flow naturally. If it doesn't work out, that's okay! You can always try again another time.\n\nRemember, the goal is to be yourself and have a genuine conversation, not to try to force something that's not meant to be.

Community Clinics: Community clinics or free clinics might offer low-cost or sliding-scale fees for medical services. You can search online for clinics in your area.\n3. Urgent Care Centers: Urgent care centers often have lower wait times and costs compared to emergency rooms. They may be a more affordable option for non-emergency situations.\n4. Telemedicine: Telemedicine services allow you to consult with a doctor remotely, which might be a more affordable option for initial consultations or follow-ups.\n5. Medicaid or Government Assistance: If you're uninsured, you might be eligible for Medicaid or other government assistance programs.

I would recommend calling your local emergency services or visiting an urgent care center to get evaluated. Even if it's just a minor issue, it's better to rule out any potential underlying conditions that could worsen over time.\n\nRemember, your health is more important than the cost.

Personally, it is a problem that has damaged a few relationships of mine and I really want to mature past this. My main problem is that whenever small bad/unlucky things, I just go from 0 to 100 angry/frustrated wise. When something uncommon happens, like when I got mugged, it didn't even faze me. I just moved on and told people that whoever did it, I hope that they had no other way and that things get better for them. However, if I spill my glass of juice in the morning, I will explode in rage, and it will ruin my day. Not only that, but I have a hard time moving on from any type of failures (relationships, exams, ect). I just obsess about it non-stop and it puts me in a bad mood.

Since you've identified your triggers (small, everyday annoyances and failures), let's focus on developing strategies to address them.\n\n1. **Mindfulness and self-awareness**: When you feel yourself getting worked up over a minor issue, take a pause and acknowledge your emotions. Recognize that it's okay to feel frustrated, but also remind yourself that it's not a life-or-death situation. Take a few deep breaths, and try to reframe the situation in a more rational light. Ask yourself, \"Is this really worth getting upset over?\"\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge your negative thoughts by reframing them in a more positive or neutral light. For example, instead of thinking \"This is the worst day ever,\" try reframing it as \"This is a minor setback, and I'll get through it.\"\n3. **Practice gratitude**: Focus on the good things in your life and express gratitude for them. This can help shift your attention away from negative thoughts and cultivate a more positive outlook. Write down three things you're grateful for each day to make it a habit.\n4. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Instead of beating yourself up over a mistake, view it as a chance to improve and move forward. Remember, everyone fails, and it's how you respond to those failures that matters.\n5. **Take breaks and engage in self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can help reduce stress and improve your overall mood. Whether it's reading, taking a walk, or practicing yoga, prioritize self-care to help manage your emotions.\n6. **Learn to let go**: Recognize that you can't control everything, and sometimes things don't go as planned. Practice letting go of the need for perfection and focus on what you can control. Remember, it's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes.\n7. **Seek support**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend or family member and ask for their support. Sometimes just talking through your emotions with someone who cares about you can help you gain a new perspective and feel less alone.\n\nRemember, changing your thought patterns and behaviors takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. Celebrate your small wins, and use them as motivation to continue working on your growth.\n\nAs for your brother's advice, I'm sure he meant well, but it's not very helpful.

Instead of sharing a long, winding story, aim for a concise summary or key insight. Practice distilling your ideas into a 30-second to 1-minute summary.

Share the main point or key idea (2-3 sentences).\n3. End with a concise conclusion or takeaway (1 sentence).\n\nThis structure will help you stay organized and ensure your message is clear.\n\nWhen explaining complex ideas, try to use analogies or relatable examples to make it more relatable.

For instance, if you're discussing a technical topic, you could compare it to a real-life scenario or a familiar concept.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to ask questions or clarify your thoughts as you're speaking.

It might be uncomfortable, but it's better to address these issues now rather than letting them simmer beneath the surface.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and communication. You and your partner can work together to find a solution that works for both of you.",

She makes it a point to remind me that she\u2019s from an upper class family by talking about expensive brands that I\u2019ve never heard of and other stuff.

    "model_response": "I totally get it. It can be really frustrating when someone constantly brags about their wealth and status. It's like, okay, I get it, you're rich, but can we talk about something else for once?\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for trying to be professional despite feeling annoyed. That's a great attitude to have.\n\nNow, here's what I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Don't engage**: When she starts talking about her wealth or family, try not to respond with \"ooh, nice\" or \"wow, that's amazing.\" Instead, just nod politely and move the conversation along. Don't give her the attention she's seeking.\n2. **Change the subject**: If you feel comfortable doing so, try to steer the conversation towards a topic that interests you or is more relevant to your work. You can say something like, \"Hey, have you seen that new project we're working on? I've been thinking about how we can improve it.\" This shows you're interested in your work and not just her wealth.\n3. **Set boundaries**: If she continues to dominate the conversation, you can say something like, \"I'm happy to hear about your weekend, but I'd love to share something about my own experiences too.\" This sets a boundary and encourages her to listen to others.\n4. **Don't compare yourself**: It's natural to feel a little envious or insecure when someone is constantly bragging about their wealth. Try not to compare yourself to her or feel like you're not good enough. Remember that your worth and value come from who you are as a person, not your bank account.\n5. **Talk to her privately**: If you feel like you've tried everything and it's still not working, you could consider having a friendly conversation with her about how you're feeling. Be honest and say something like, \"Hey, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I feel like you're dominating the conversation a lot. Can we find a way to balance it out?\" Approach the conversation with empathy and an open mind, and try to avoid being accusatory.\n\nRemember, you don't have to tolerate someone's constant bragging, but you also don't have to be confrontational. By being assertive, professional, and respectful, you can set boundaries and maintain a positive working relationship.",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Use a transition phrase**: Instead of \"Anyway...\", try saying something like, \"Speaking of which, I should probably get going\" or \"I've got another commitment coming up, so I should probably wrap things up.\" This acknowledges the conversation and provides a reason for ending it.\n2. **Offer a summary or recap**: Summarize the main points of the conversation and say, \"It was great chatting with you, but I should probably get back to [insert task or responsibility].\" This shows you value the conversation and are not just trying to escape.\n3. **Use a gentle redirect**: If you're in the middle of a task, you can say, \"I'm getting close to finishing this up, but I should probably focus on it now.\" This is a polite way to excuse yourself without being abrupt.\n4. **Make a plan to continue the conversation later**: If you're really enjoying the conversation, you can say, \"It's been great talking to you, but I should probably wrap things up for now. Let's catch up again soon?\" This leaves the door open for future conversations while still acknowledging your time constraints.\n5. **Use a nonverbal cue**: If you're in a situation where you're not comfortable saying anything, a gentle nod, a smile, and a slight head tilt can be a nonverbal cue that it's time to wrap things up.\n\nRemember, the key is to be polite, considerate, and genuine in your approach. Don't feel like you need to make up an elaborate excuse or apologize excessively \u2013 a simple, sincere \"I should probably get going\" or \"I need to get back to [task]\" can be enough.",

It's just your brain's way of saying, \"Hey, this is a big deal, and I'm not sure I want to do it!\" But, with some strategies, you can learn to manage those nerves and even find some confidence. Here are a few tips to help you get through your presentation:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: The more you know your stuff, the less room there is for anxiety to creep in. Make sure you understand the material, practice your presentation several times, and have a clear structure in mind. This will help you feel more confident and in control.\n2. **Focus on your message**: Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the message you want to convey to your audience. Remember, you're not there to impress anyone with your speaking skills; you're there to share your ideas and insights. Keep your focus on the content, and you'll be less likely to get caught up in your nerves.\n3. **Take deep breaths**: Before you go up there, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system and slow down your heart rate. You can also do some quick exercises to get your blood flowing, like rolling your shoulders or tapping your feet.\n4. **Visualize success**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself acing the presentation. See yourself speaking clearly, confidently, and engaging with the audience. Visualize the feeling of accomplishment and pride you'll have after it's over. This can help boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.\n5. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of thinking \"I'm going to fail\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" try reframing your thoughts to \"I'm prepared,\" \"I've got this,\" or \"I'm excited to share my ideas.\" This can help shift your mindset and reduce anxiety.\n6. **Get familiar with the setting**: If possible, visit the presentation room beforehand to get a feel for the space. This can help you feel more comfortable and reduce anxiety about the unknown.\n7. **Use positive self-talk**: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations. Repeat phrases like \"I've got this,\" \"I'm well-prepared,\" or \"I can do this\" to help calm your nerves and boost confidence.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be a little nervous \u2013 it's normal! But with practice and preparation, you can learn to manage those nerves and even find a sense of excitement and confidence. You got this!",

    "sentence": "TL;DR : I (F33) had a date with a (M40) that left me feeling really disregarded, need some help figuring out if I'm overreacting or if I should avoid this person.\n\n\nSo I'm someone who used to date a lot but I've barely seen anyone during the last few years because of covid and really shitty mental health. I also used to have a really easy and fun sexuality, but found out more recently that I have a bit more trouble enjoying myself and that random hookups with a new person make me nervous and aren't the most satisfying. It's not trauma related or anything, I think it's just me being older, brain meds and self-doubt.\n\nI feel some kind of way about that, like, having meh sex makes me feel like my body doesn't work the way I want it to anymore. I really miss how carefree and fun sex used to be for me, it used to be a big part of my life and I feel robbed of a part of myself. I know I can still feel desire and pleasure but when I'm with a partner and can't access that it really gets me down.\n\nI've been in a bit of a better place mentally in general though and I've started socialising a lot more, which is good.\n\nI recently met a cute guy I like. We connected pretty well and had a date last weekend where we had a really fun make out session, it was unexpected for me but I really enjoyed myself. He's a little nervous and awkward at times but honestly so am I.\n\nA possible yellow flag is that he's in one of these \"open\" relationships where they both date other people but his partner doesn't want to know anything. Not my favourite situation but I'm not looking for something serious and it's unlikely I would ever meet his partner. (Edit) to clarify, I am also poly, comfortable with my single life ATM and would mostly like a nice FWB situation.\n\nWe planned a 2nd date today at my place. Yesterday he messaged me saying he wasn't sure he could make it because he got some bad news from a close friend and wasn't in the best headspace. (I found out later it involves a very sick child so I can understand). I told him we could of course reschedule, but he eventually decided to come over anyway. \n\nWe had coffee and a really nice chat but he did check his phone a few times and let me know he'd need to call his friend later in the evening. We made out again, which eventually led to sex. The making out and foreplay part was fun, but when we had sex it was really rushed and kinda rough and lasted for like a couple minutes.\n\nI was pretty confused. He said he felt like I wasn't enjoying myself as much once we started penetration and so he tried to make it quick. I told him I wasn't sure why he would think that and I'd actually have liked to take it slow and enjoy myself. I'd have felt fine if he'd taken a bit of time to take care of me afterwards but instead he got really nervous and apologetic for misjudging the situation.\n\nI think he felt pretty overwhelmed because he had to call his friend soon and at the same time he felt like he messed up and could see I was confused and kind of upset. He left quickly after that, I asked if he could call his friend and then maybe we could chill together for a bit but he said he wouldn't be feeling okay afterwards, so he just went away.\n\nHe messaged me once he got home to apologise again, said he wouldn't bother me if I didn't want to but he'd like to see me again. I'm just feeling kind of angry and really shit about myself. At the same time I get being an anxious person and I understand the situation with his friend would be pretty overwhelming so I don't want to be callous.\n\nI haven't replied to his message yet. I'm having difficulty judging if I feel like shit because of my own baggage or if he acted badly towards me. Right now I kind of want to get mad or just ghost him, but at the same time I don't often meet someone I have good chemistry with. I don't know if I should give him a chance or if he's inconsiderate and too much drama.",
    "human_response": "The part the weirds me out is that when he thought you weren\u2019t enjoying it, his answer was to keep going. He thought you were upset but didn\u2019t talk about it but also didn\u2019t stop pounding away either. That\u2019s gross. He sounds like a shitty partner.",
    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling upset about this date. It's understandable, given the circumstances. Let's break it down together.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're recognizing your own feelings and not blaming yourself entirely for his behavior. That's a huge step forward in self-awareness.\n\nRegarding the date itself, it's clear that your partner had a lot on his plate, with the news about his friend's sick child. While it's understandable that he might have been distracted, it's also important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in the situation.\n\nThe fact that he checked his phone multiple times and didn't seem to be fully present during the date is a red flag. It's not just about being in a rush to get to his friend's call; it's about respecting your time and attention as well.\n\nThe sex itself was also a bit concerning. Rushed and rough sex can be uncomfortable, especially if you're not in the right headspace. It's not just about the duration, but the quality of the experience. It's possible that he was so focused on his own anxiety and stress that he wasn't fully present for you.\n\nConsidering his apology and his willingness to acknowledge his mistakes, it's good that he's taking responsibility for his actions. However, it's also important to consider whether he's willing to make changes to prioritize your needs and boundaries in the future.\n\nGiven your own history and feelings about your sexuality, it's essential to prioritize your own comfort and satisfaction in any future encounters. If you do decide to give him another chance, make sure to communicate your needs and boundaries clearly. If he's not willing to listen and adapt, it might be best to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to acknowledge that you might have some residual feelings from your past experiences and that it takes time to adjust to new situations. You're doing great by taking the time to process your emotions and think critically about this situation.\n\nTake your time to respond to his message, and consider having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and concerns. Remember that you deserve to be respected, heard, and prioritized in any relationship.",

    "model_response": "I understand your concern for privacy and the frustration you're experiencing with your family member. Unfortunately, there isn't a straightforward way to add a password to individual Gmail messages or folders. However, I can offer some suggestions to help you secure your inbox and maintain your privacy:\n\n1. **Two-Step Verification (2SV)**: You've already enabled 2SV, which is a great security measure. This adds an extra layer of protection, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your account.\n2. **App Passwords**: You can generate app-specific passwords for your family member to use when accessing your device. This way, they'll need to enter a unique password for your email client, rather than your actual Gmail password. To do this, go to the Google Account settings, click on \"Signing in to Google,\" and then \"App passwords.\"\n3. **Folder-level permissions**: While you can't password-protect individual emails, you can use folder-level permissions to restrict access to specific folders. Create a new label (folder) and add the emails you want to keep private to it. Then, go to the \"Labels\" tab in your Gmail settings and click on the three vertical dots next to the label. Select \"Settings for this label\" and then \"Grant access\" to add specific users or groups with permission to view the label.\n4. **Private browsing**: Consider using a private browsing mode or incognito window when accessing your email on your device. This will prevent your family member from seeing your browsing history and email activity.\n5. **Email client settings**: If you're using a desktop email client like Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, you can set up a separate profile or account for your family member to use. This will keep your personal email separate and secure.\n6. **Screen time management**: Consider setting up screen time limits or restrictions on your device to limit your family member's access to your email or other sensitive areas.\n7. **Open conversation**: Have an open and honest conversation with your family member about your concerns and boundaries. It's essential to set clear expectations and respect each other's privacy.\n8. **Consider a separate account**: If your family member's behavior continues to be a problem, it might be necessary to create a separate email account for them to use. This will help you maintain your privacy and keep your personal and professional emails separate.\n\nAs for hiding subject lines and previews, you can try using a browser extension like \"Email Privacy\" or \"Hide Email Preview\" to conceal the subject lines and previews. However, keep in mind that these extensions may not be foolproof and can be bypassed by determined individuals.\n\nRemember, while these measures can help improve your email security and privacy, they're not foolproof. It's essential to maintain open communication with your family member and set clear boundaries to protect your personal and professional life.",

Even if it's not your bank, you might be able to find a nearby option.\n2. **Ask a neighbor or friend**: If you have a neighbor or friend who's nearby, you could ask them if they have some quarters you could borrow.

You can also try searching for \"24-hour laundry near me\" to see if there are any laundromats that might be open late or have an ATM on site.\n4. **Consider a mobile payment option**: If you have a smartphone, you might be able to use a mobile payment app like Venmo or Cash App to send money to yourself or transfer funds to your account. This might not give you quarters, but it could help you access your funds more quickly.\n5. **Postpone your laundry**: If all else fails, you might need to postpone your laundry trip until you can get to your bank. This might not be ideal, but it's better than stressing about not having quarters.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help or ask for a temporary solution. Don't stress too much about it, and I'm sure you'll find a way to get those quarters!",

Just make sure you're not jumping into things impulsively. Weigh the pros and cons, and have a plan B in place.\n2. **Focus on personal growth**: Use this decade to develop skills, learn new things, and challenge yourself. Whether it's reading books, taking online courses, or practicing a new hobby, prioritize personal growth.\n3. **Build meaningful relationships**: Your 20s are a great time to nurture friendships and build new ones. Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you, and don't be afraid to put in the effort to maintain those relationships.\n4. **Take care of your physical and mental health**: Your 20s can be a time of high stress, so make sure you're taking care of your physical and mental health. Prioritize exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. Don't be afraid to seek help if you're struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.\n5. **Be open to change**: Your 20s are a time of transition, and things won't always go as planned. Be open to change, and don't be too attached to specific outcomes. Adaptability is key to navigating this decade.\n6. **Practice gratitude and self-compassion**: It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of adulting, but don't forget to practice gratitude and self-compassion. Focus on the good things in your life, and be kind to yourself when things don't go as planned.\n7. **Travel and explore**: Your 20s are a great time to travel, explore new places, and experience different cultures. Take advantage of this decade to broaden your horizons and create lasting memories.\n8. **Set realistic goals and priorities**: Don't set yourself up for disappointment by trying to do too much too soon. Set realistic goals, prioritize what's important to you, and focus on making progress rather than perfection.\n\nRemember, your 20s are a time of growth, experimentation, and exploration. Don't be too hard on yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

However, it's understandable that you're worried about being perceived as overstepping or giving off the wrong vibe.\n\nHere are some tips that might help you navigate these situations:\n\n1. **Be mindful of the context**: When someone is sick or going through a tough time, it's natural to want to help. However, it's essential to consider the context and the person's current emotional state. If they decline your offer, respect their decision and don't push the issue.\n2. **Keep it simple and brief**: You mentioned that your texts can be lengthy, which might give an overbearing impression. Try to keep your messages concise and to the point. A simple \"Hey, hope you're feeling better\" or \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" can go a long way.\n3. **Pay attention to body language and tone**: When interacting with someone, pay attention to their body language and tone. If they seem uncomfortable or hesitant, it might be a sign that you're coming on too strong. Adjust your approach accordingly.\n4. **Respect their boundaries**: If someone declines your offer or seems uncomfortable, respect their decision and don't push the issue. It's essential to prioritize their feelings and emotional boundaries.\n5. **Communicate with your friends**: Openly discuss your intentions and feelings with your friends. Let them know that you're coming from a place of kindness and that you're willing to respect their boundaries.\n6. **Don't overthink it**: It's natural to worry about giving off the wrong vibe, but try not to overthink it too much. Focus on being genuine and respectful in your interactions, and trust that your friends will appreciate your efforts.\n7. **Seek feedback**: If you're unsure about how someone is perceiving your actions, ask for feedback. This can help you adjust your approach and avoid misunderstandings in the future.\n\nRemember, building strong relationships takes time and effort. It's okay to make mistakes, but it's how you learn from them that matters. By being mindful of your actions and respecting others' boundaries, you'll be well on your way to fostering meaningful and healthy relationships.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a process. You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your actions and boundaries.",

    "model_response": "Whoa, that's a wild scenario! First, take a deep breath and congratulations on the unexpected windfall!\n\nBefore you start spending or making any rash decisions, take some time to:\n\n1. Verify the deposit: Confirm with your bank that the large sum is indeed accurate and not an error. You can do this by contacting their customer service or checking your account online.\n2. Understand the source: If the deposit is not from a known source, such as a paycheck or transfer, try to determine where it came from. This could be a one-time mistake, a misdirected payment, or even a mistake by someone else's bank.\n3. Consider taxes: Depending on the amount and source, you might need to report the deposit to the IRS. Consult with a tax professional or the IRS website to determine your obligations.\n4. Set aside some for taxes and fees: It's essential to have a portion of the funds set aside for taxes, fees, and any potential penalties. This will help you avoid any financial surprises down the line.\n5. Create a plan: Decide how you'll manage the remaining funds. Will you use them for debt repayment, savings, investments, or a mix of everything? Make a plan that aligns with your financial goals and priorities.\n6. Avoid impulsive spending: It's crucial to avoid making impulsive purchases or withdrawals. Take your time, and consider seeking professional advice if you're unsure about the best course of action.\n7. Review your budget: Use this opportunity to review your budget and see where you can optimize your spending habits. Consider increasing your savings rate, paying off high-interest debt, or investing in a diversified portfolio.\n\nRemember, a large sum of money can be a blessing, but it's essential to handle it responsibly and thoughtfully. Take your time, prioritize your financial well-being, and make informed decisions that align with your long-term goals.",

    "human_response": "Uhhh, confront the person and stop being socially inept and anxious about confrontations. Call that bitch out.",
    "model_response": "I understand your concern. Dealing with someone who's talking negatively about you behind your back can be frustrating and hurtful. Since you value your relationships and don't want to escalate the situation, I'll offer some advice to help you address this issue without burning bridges.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's clarify that it's not about being jealous of your success; it's about addressing the hurtful behavior. You didn't ask for a promotion or recognition; you earned it through your hard work.\n\nTo stop her from talking badly about you, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Stay calm and composed**: When you hear about the rumors or witness her negative behavior, take a deep breath and count to ten. Avoid reacting impulsively or emotionally, as this might fuel the fire.\n2. **Focus on your work**: Continue delivering excellent work, and let your actions speak for themselves. This will help you maintain a strong reputation and show that her negative comments are unfounded.\n3. **Don't engage or react**: Avoid responding to her negative comments or engaging in arguments. This will only give her the attention she's seeking and might escalate the situation.\n4. **Talk to a trusted colleague or supervisor**: Share your concerns with someone you trust, like a colleague or supervisor. They can offer guidance, support, and potentially help mediate the situation.\n5. **Set boundaries**: If you feel comfortable, you can have a calm and respectful conversation with her, stating how her behavior is affecting you and your relationships. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I've noticed that you've been talking about me behind my back, and it's affecting my feelings. I value our previous friendship and would like to resolve this. Could we talk about what's going on and find a way to move forward positively?\"\n6. **Don't expect an immediate change**: Unfortunately, people often don't change their behavior overnight. Be patient and focus on maintaining your positive relationships with others.\n7. **Consider a mediated conversation**: If the situation persists and you feel it's affecting your well-being, consider seeking the help of a mediator, such as a supervisor or HR representative. They can facilitate a conversation to address the issues and find a resolution.\n8. **Prioritize self-care**: Remember to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Focus on your well-being, and don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed.\n\nRemember, you didn't ask for this situation, and you didn't deserve to be spoken about negatively. You've earned your success, and it's not your fault if someone can't handle it. Keep being your amazing self, and don't let someone else's negativity define your worth.\n\nPlease keep me updated on how things progress, and I'll be happy to offer further guidance if needed.",

You've had some brief conversations about school stuff, which is a good start. Since you're introverted, it might be helpful to start small and find a low-key way to interact with him.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to find a common interest or hobby outside of school that you can bond over. This could be a TV show, movie, book, or even a video game. You can casually bring it up in conversation and see if he's interested. This can be a great way to build a connection without feeling too awkward or forced.\n\nAnother idea is to participate in a group project or activity outside of class that you both might be interested in. This could be a campus event, volunteer work, or even a meetup group. Having a shared experience can help create a sense of camaraderie and make it easier to talk about non-school-related topics.\n\nWhen you do talk to him, try to be yourself and don't overthink it too much. Ask him questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest in getting to know him better. Remember, it's okay if the conversations don't always flow effortlessly \u2013 it's a process!\n\nLastly, don't put too much pressure on it. If you don't become BFFs, that's okay too! The goal is to build a connection and have someone you can relate to, not to force a friendship that might not be meant to be.\n\nTake it one step at a time, be yourself, and see where things go.

Things were very good early on but have been sliding the last 2 months. She's very sweet, and very supportive, as I am with her. Often times though when she is stressed or frustrated with something such as work, family, friends, she has a tendency to take the frustration out on me. Not in a physical way mind you, but she vents at me, and not to me. Gets cranky and flustered at me. I have addressed it but as soon as I do, its like getting punched and then her saying I'm sorry.\n\nAnother thing that struck a nerve with me was when I talked to her mother on the phone about a week ago.

Now, I was told by my girlfriend that her ex husband was having an affair, and started talking to another guy out of spite. But if she was having the affair first, that's a whole different story.\n\nThe big problem came last week, and I have not addressed it yet, but intend to. Her and I drove to pick my mom up at the airport, and while we were driving back to our place, a message popped up on her screen in my car from the name \"James\". My eyes instantly darted off the road and to her phone that was in her lap, and the message said \"So are we still on for drinks sometime?\" I tried not to make it obvious I had seen the message on her phone, so I asked her \"who's James?\" She said \"that's my gay best friend\". She has mentioned one of her friends is gay, but I have yet to meet him in person. Regardless of whether he is gay or not, the fact that she's been planning to go out for drinks with someone of the opposite sex and not telling me really rubs me the wrong way. I keep asking myself how she would feel if I had a female friend who wanted to go for drinks without me telling her and even if they were gay, she would be pissed. The orientation doesn't matter.

The way she vents her frustrations at you, rather than addressing the root cause, can be really hurtful.

Listen actively and try to understand where he's coming from. Acknowledge his emotions and validate his experiences.\n7. Work together to find a solution: Collaborate to find a solution that works for both of you. You may need to set boundaries around communication or establish a plan for how to handle future encounters with his ex.\n\nRemember, honesty and open communication are essential in any relationship. Approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nHow do you feel about this approach?

You might get a better offer: If your employer values you and wants to retain you, they might be willing to match or come close to the better offer.\n2. You can maintain a positive relationship: By being transparent and giving your employer a chance to match the offer, you can maintain a good relationship and potentially avoid burning bridges.\n\nCons of approaching your current employer:\n\n1. They might not match the offer: Your employer might not be willing or able to match the better offer, which could lead to a stalemate or even a counteroffer that's not as attractive.\n2. You might create tension: If your employer feels pressured or surprised by the information, it could lead to tension or even a negative impact on your working relationship.\n3. You might be perceived as disloyal: Depending on your employer's culture and your role, sharing a better offer with them might be seen as disloyal or unprofessional.\n\nBefore approaching your employer, consider the following:\n\n1. Reflect on your priorities: Are you truly only motivated by the salary increase, or are there other factors at play? If it's the latter, it might be worth exploring those aspects with your employer.\n2. Evaluate your current benefits: While the better offer might be tempting, don't forget to consider the overall package, including benefits, work-life balance, and opportunities for growth.\n3.

Focus on your value to the company, your achievements, and your concerns about the salary gap.\n\nIf you decide to approach your employer, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1. Schedule a private meeting: Choose a private setting where you can have an uninterrupted conversation.\n2. Be transparent and respectful: Share the offer and your concerns about the salary gap, but do so in a respectful and professional manner.\n3. Avoid ultimatums: Don't threaten to leave if the employer doesn't match the offer. Instead, express your concerns and let them know you're willing to work together to find a solution.\n4. Be prepared for a no: If your employer can't or won't match the offer, be prepared to consider alternative solutions, such as a counteroffer or a compromise.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to weigh the potential outcomes and consider what's best for your career and well-being.

Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then.

Use \"I\" statements: Instead of saying \"you never pay rent,\" say \"I feel frustrated when I don't know when I'll receive my share of the rent.\" This helps to own your emotions and avoid blame.\n3. Focus on the impact: Explain how her lack of communication and inconsistent contributions affect you and your relationship. Be specific about how it makes you feel and how it impacts your life.\n4. Set clear expectations: Discuss what you need from her in terms of financial contributions and communication. Be specific about what you're looking for and why it's important to you.\n5. Listen to her perspective: Give your girlfriend space to share her thoughts and feelings. Listen actively and try to understand where she's coming from. It's possible she's struggling with anxiety, feelings of guilt, or other issues that are making it hard for her to open up about her finances.\n\nSome potential questions to ask her:\n\n* How do you plan to contribute to our shared life, and when can I expect to receive my share of the rent?\n* What's going on that's making it difficult for you to communicate about your finances?\n* How can we work together to find a solution that works for both of us?\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and communication. If your girlfriend is unwilling to listen, discuss, and work together to find a solution, it may be a sign of deeper issues that could impact your relationship's long-term viability.\n\nBefore making any drastic decisions, consider seeking couples therapy to work through these issues together. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and find a solution that works for both of you.",

    "sentence": "Sorry this is so long-winded,\n\ntl;dr : He is now wishy washy about marriage and I told him that is what I want or we should go separate ways. Complicated by our adorable oopsie baby and logistics of our families living far apart. I also love him and care about him a lot but don't want to suck it up and end up resenting him.\n\nContext: him and I have been together 2.5 years. We live close to his family. My family and friends live about a 20hr drive away. We were friends prior and I moved up here for work. We moved in together pretty quickly (he had just sold his house and I was relocating-so timing and convenience were a factor). We then purchased a house together last year. We still have separate finances. I am the higher earner by quite a bit. Neither of us was certain we wanted kids or marriage and it wasn\u2019t something we were thinking about doing in the near future.\n\nSurprise, I got pregnant. Despite birth control and condoms. We were both very surprised and in shock but I was more distressed about the pregnancy. He quickly became excited about it and being a dad. We decided together to continue with the pregnancy. We discussed marriage during the pregnancy. He \u201cjokingly\u201d proposed to me with a candy ring. He later made it clear this was a joke. I discussed with him that it is important to me that I share a last name with my child and that if marriage wasn\u2019t something he wanted to move forward with, we wouldn\u2019t give the baby only his last name. He assured me this was something he wanted and we discussed moving forward with this after the baby was born. He was clear on my reasoning for this being what I want: I do love him very much, I want to be a family and that is what family looks like a means to me, I do see that as the ultimate way to demonstrate commitment and don\u2019t want to be with someone who isn\u2019t 100% sure of their feelings for me and our relationship, the state we are in does not recognize common-law relationships, last name, etc.,\n\nFast forward to now, our baby is 6 months old and we have had this conversation again (3 times in the last few months) about our relationship progressing and having a shared vision for the future. He is now saying he doesn\u2019t understand why it needs to be on my timeline and that it doesn\u2019t make sense because he thought we were progressing. He has said it is something he wants but why does it have to be now.\n\nA month or so ago, I brought it up and gave him an out. I told him that it is okay if we have different goals and timelines but that he needs to be honest with me so we can both move forward, together or apart. He is aware I wouldn\u2019t keep our child from him or anything like that. He said it is something he wanted. I told him that his words need to be followed up with actions or they don\u2019t hold weight. I told him that I\u2019m not waiting around as that would lead to resentment and I don\u2019t want a relationship or home with unhappy parents for my son to grow up in. He said he would act. Nothing came of this.\n\nI brought it up last night. I told him nothing has changed and that speaks volumes. I told him it\u2019s clear to me that we are not on the same page and that it is okay. I told him without a shared vision of the future and what we want, our relationship can\u2019t move forward. I also told him I deserve someone that knows what they want and is excited to be with me and be a family. I acknowledged that nothing about our situation is normal or traditional and things would be different without a baby but here we are. I gave him the opportunity to show me different but he got upset saying it \u201cisn\u2019t fair\u201d and \u201cwhat did he do wrong\u201d and \u201che doesn\u2019t want it to be this way\u201d.\n\nThis situation is obviously complicated as I want to move closer to be near my family if we are not together and figuring out what that would look like with our child is a lot. I had a really bad pregnancy with complications, preterm baby and severe post Partum depression. Our baby is great now\u2026pretty calm and content, has been sleeping through the night for a while and things overall have improved. So we are out of the newborn craziness. He is a great dad and is very caring and does a lot for me. To be clear, I am not saying we need to get married tomorrow and neither of us are on board with dumping money into a wedding (hello college fund for baby). I am asking for a concrete action that shows intent and that we are moving in that direction.\n\nAm I completely crazy for ending our relationship?

His reactions to your concerns, such as feeling upset and defensive, may indicate that he's not taking your feelings and needs seriously enough.\n\nConsidering your history, it's reasonable to expect that you've had open and honest discussions about your desires and expectations. It's not fair to expect you to wait indefinitely for him to come around to your way of thinking. You've already given him multiple opportunities to take action and demonstrate his commitment, and he hasn't followed through.\n\nGiven your concerns about your son's well-being and the importance of a healthy, committed relationship, it's worth considering whether this relationship is sustainable for you in the long term. You've already acknowledged that you don't want to be in a relationship with someone who isn't 100% sure of their feelings and commitment to you.\n\nIt's not about being \"crazy\" for ending the relationship; it's about prioritizing your own emotional well-being and the well-being of your child. You deserve to be in a relationship where your partner is committed to building a future together and willing to work through challenges with you.\n\nBefore making any decisions, take time to reflect on what you want for yourself and your child. Consider what a healthy, committed relationship looks like to you, and whether your current relationship aligns with those values. It may be helpful to have an honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and see if there's any willingness to work together to address them. If not, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and consider what's best for you and your child.",

Be honest with yourself about your emotional readiness and what you're willing to commit to.\n2. **Choose the right time and place**: Consider the timing and setting for your conversation. You want to pick a private, quiet spot where both of you feel comfortable and won't be interrupted. Make sure you're both in a relatively calm state of mind.\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of asking \"Will you go out with me?\", try framing your request as an expression of your feelings and desires. For example: \"I've been thinking a lot about us and I was wondering if you'd be interested in exploring a more serious relationship with me.\"\n4. **Be specific about what you're looking for**: Be clear about what you're looking for in a relationship, whether it's exclusivity, long-term commitment, or something else. This shows that you're serious about the relationship and willing to communicate openly.\n5. **Listen to their response**: Pay attention to their feelings and concerns, and be prepared to have a respectful conversation about any reservations they may have.\n6. **Avoid putting pressure or ultimatums**: Remember that the other person may not feel the same way, and that's okay. Don't try to guilt-trip or pressure them into a decision. Instead, respect their choice and maintain a healthy distance if needed.\n\nSome example phrases to get you started:\n\n* \"I really enjoy spending time with you, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in exploring a more serious relationship with me.\"\n* \"I feel like we have a great connection, and I was thinking about taking our relationship to the next level. Would you be open to discussing what that means to you?\"\n* \"I've been thinking a lot about my feelings for you, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in being my partner in a committed relationship.\"\n\nRemember to be genuine, respectful, and open-minded, and you'll be more likely to have a positive and meaningful conversation.

The IRS views gifts as non-taxable, but only if they are truly gifts, not compensation for services.\n\nThe IRS defines a gift as \"a transfer of property or services without expecting something in return.\" If you're paying your cousin for their services, such as mowing your lawn or doing tasks, that's considered compensation, not a gift.\n\nIf you're trying to avoid paying taxes on these services, I'd caution against labeling the check as a \"gift.\" Instead, consider the following options:\n\n1. Report the payment as income on your tax return and claim the standard deduction or itemize your deductions, depending on your situation.\n2. Consider hiring your cousin as an independent contractor or employee, which would require reporting their income and paying employment taxes.\n3.

Recognize that you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for why you don't want to engage with them. Your time and energy are valuable, and you shouldn't waste them on people who are draining or toxic.\n\nHere are some tips to help you deal with these individuals:\n\n1. **Set clear boundaries**: Be direct and firm in your communication. Let them know that you don't want to talk to them, and that you won't engage with them. Be specific about what you're comfortable with and what you're not.\n2. **Block and limit contact**: Use technology to your advantage. Block their number, email, or social media accounts. Limit your interactions with them to a minimum. If you need to, take a break from social media or change your phone number.\n3. **Don't engage**: When they do contact you, don't respond. Don't give them the satisfaction of a reaction. Ignore their messages, calls, or texts. This can be hard, but it's essential to starve them of attention.\n4. **Document everything**: Keep a record of all interactions, including dates, times, and details of what was said. This can help you track patterns and provide evidence if needed.\n5. **Seek support**: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support and guidance. Sharing your experiences with someone you trust can help you process your feelings and gain a different perspective.\n6. **Practice self-care**: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize your well-being.\n7. **Consider a restraining order**: If the person is physically threatening, harassing, or stalking you, consider obtaining a restraining order. This can provide legal protection and help you feel safer.\n8. **Don't internalize their behavior**: Remember that their behavior is a reflection of them, not you. You don't deserve their toxicity, and it's not your fault that they're struggling.\n9. **Be prepared for escalation**: Unfortunately, some people may not respect your boundaries or take no for an answer. Be prepared for escalation and have a plan in place for dealing with it.\n10. **Take back control**: Remember that you have the power to control your life and your relationships. Don't let someone else dictate how you feel or what you do. Take back control and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, you don't have to deal with this alone.

It takes a lot of courage to confront the unknown and the uncomfortable. Now, let's work on addressing your concerns.\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to have these thoughts, and it doesn't mean you're weak or flawed. Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n2. **Focus on the present**: When you start feeling overwhelmed, bring your attention to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, or a calming activity. This can help ground you and reduce anxiety.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of dwelling on the fear of pain or loss, try to reframe your thoughts. Ask yourself: \"What can I control in this moment?\" Focus on the things you can control, like taking care of your ankle or engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n4. **Develop a growth mindset**: Challenge your thoughts by asking yourself: \"What can I learn from this experience?\" or \"How can I grow as a person from this?\" This can help shift your focus from fear to personal growth.\n5. **Practice mindfulness and self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you calmness and relaxation, such as meditation, yoga, or a warm bath.

Sharing your concerns with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and validated.\n7. **Celebrate the present**: Make a conscious effort to appreciate the present moment. Focus on the good things in your life, no matter how small they may seem. Practice gratitude by writing down three things you're thankful for each day.\n8. **Remind yourself of your strength**: You've already survived many challenges in your life, including the ankle sprain. Remember that you're capable of overcoming difficult situations.\n\nAs for having happy thoughts, try these:\n\n1. **Practice positivity**: Write down three things you're looking forward to in the coming days or weeks. Focus on the good things to come.\n2. **Engage in activities you love**: Do something that brings you joy, whether it's reading, drawing, or playing with a pet.\n3. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and avoid negative influences.\n4. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional needs.

Background: we\u2019ve been living together for two years and have an otherwise amazing relationship. He does not have a relationship with his dad (his only parent), but seems to want to establish one even though this man is pushing him away and keeps treating him with utter disrespect.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about marriage and our timelines/plans practically since we started dating. We both initially wanted a big wedding after I was done with grad school (2021) but then we realized we weren\u2019t in a rush to get married and obviously didn\u2019t make any plans because of Covid-related restrictions. \n\nThis year right after New Year\u2019s he says 2022 would be a good year to get married. We talk about it briefly, and then I didn\u2019t bring it up again because I was expecting a proposal.\n\nBy mid-April I realized there would be no way to have the wedding we had talked about in 2022. I bring it up and he says his relationship with his dad is making him feel depressed and he needs time to deal with his feelings. I let it go but remind him that if we do plan on having a wedding we need to at least set a date (I propose summer 2023) because many of our family members we\u2019d want there live abroad and need plenty of time to make plans.\n\nIn July he drunkenly tells me that his dad disapproves of our relationship because he doesn\u2019t like my family (he doesn\u2019t know any of us directly), and that this has been weighing on him. I thought okay, he didn\u2019t want to get married before sharing this with me and don\u2019t think much of it.\n\nCome September I finally bring it up and ask what\u2019s happening. He tells me he wants to get married but doesn\u2019t want a wedding.\n\nHe wants our closest people there but not his dad and he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable having a huge wedding because people would talk about his dad being absent and even though they do not have a relationship he wants to protect him from the humiliation.\n\nI believe he wants to marry me because he\u2019s been trying to convince me to do a civil ceremony ASAP because we talked about starting a family and making big purchases (car, home). He is however adamant about not wanting a wedding.\n\nBear in mind we come from a culture (Eastern Europe) where huge weddings (300+) people are the norm and family is usually very involved.\n\nI told him I would feel humiliated if he chose not to have the wedding we\u2019ve been planning for over 3 years (and have told people about) because he is protective of his father\u2019s feelings and public opinion over his absence, especially when this man doesn\u2019t even know me and is against me.\n\nI feel so disappointed and hurt that I am considering breaking up with him. Talking about the wedding so much has made me not even want one, ever, because it would feel forced.\n\nI just want him to want to choose me over anyone.\n\nAny perspective would be highly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr: Boyfriend of over four years wants to get married and start a family but doesn\u2019t want a wedding because he thinks it will hurt his estranged father\u2019s public image.",

    "model_response": "I can sense your frustration and hurt. It's understandable that you're feeling that way. Let's break this down together.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your boyfriend's decision not to have a wedding might not be entirely about you, but also about his complicated relationship with his father. It's not uncommon for people to prioritize family dynamics over personal desires, especially when it comes to their parents.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to recognize that you have a right to your own feelings and desires. You've invested four and a half years into this relationship, and you've made plans and shared your dreams with others. It's natural to feel hurt and disappointed when those plans are put on hold or altered.\n\nHere's a question to consider: what are you willing to compromise on? Is there a middle ground you could find with your boyfriend? Could you have a small, intimate ceremony that's more private and less focused on public opinion? Or is the idea of a big wedding a non-negotiable for you?\n\nIt's also important to consider whether your boyfriend's reluctance to have a wedding is a deal-breaker for you. If you feel like he's prioritizing his father's feelings over yours and your relationship, it might be a sign of a deeper issue.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. It's essential to express your concerns and needs to him, and to understand his perspective as well. You might also want to explore what his father's disapproval means to him and how it affects his life.\n\nRemember, relationships involve compromise and growth. You and your boyfriend have been together for a long time, and it's normal to have differences. But it's how you navigate those differences that matters. Take your time, think carefully, and prioritize your own emotional well-being in this situation.",

You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I want to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I love and respect you for who you are, and I value our relationship. However, when you wear revealing clothes, it makes me feel uncomfortable. I understand that it's about you feeling confident and expressing yourself, but for me, it's hard to reconcile that with my own feelings. Can we find a way to compromise and make each other feel good about ourselves and our relationship?\"\n\nRemember that relationships are about growth, communication, and compromise. It's okay if you don't see eye-to-eye on everything, but it's essential to prioritize open and honest conversations. You can work together to find a solution that respects both of your needs and boundaries.\n\nUltimately, it's not about whether your discomfort is \"right\" or \"wrong,\" but about finding a way to navigate your differences and prioritize your own emotional well-being.",

I am an over thinker, and am quite sensitive towards what others tell me, and I find it happening more at more at work recently. When something is said to trigger my sensitivity, I would dwell on it, get upset over it and think about it non stop, thinking of all the possible scenarios that might have could have caused them to say that. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to take deep breaths, walk away, but I lose a disgusting amount of sleep over it. I will usually calm down after a lot of effort in 5-7 days after the incident.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how I can speed up this process?",
    "human_response": "Howdy, I'm a therapist that specializes in trauma and suicide. One of the best things to do really is to *just breathe* to regulate the nervous system, but as one of my teen clients put it, \"that's condescending as fuck in the moment.\" It can also send people spiraling further if they have CPTSD/haven't had the opportunity (yet!) to develop the capacity to self-soothe or are otherwise dysregulated to the point where bringing focus more internally is just not a great option (like with clients with chronic pain or strong physical anxiety/trauma). So if breathing exercises aren't on the table, the best advice I have is the classic external exercise of 5-4-3-2-1 grounding:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5 - things you can see\n\n4 - things you can feel\n\n3 - things you can hear\n\n2 - things you can smell\n\n1 - taste/name something positive about yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my personal life I'm a nerd so beyond breathing exercises, like box breathing, I like to hum the ABC's or something since humming relaxes the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is stimulated when your system is dysregulated for whatever reason and it can set off more biological reactions that wig you out even further. Also a big fan of literal grounding like laying down on the floor and relaxing into it. I do that between sessions sometimes.\n\nReally anything that can regulate your system more will bring more of your executive functioning back online, so petting pets, playing with fidgets, putting on warmer or cooler clothes, or doing anything mindfully. DBT skills are great to learn for this reason. We are also contextually created people, so removing yourself from your present environment/stressor if you feel yourself starting to get activated (whatever that means for you, I usually notice myself getting more agitated or my stomach starting to ache) can do wonders.

    "model_response": "I totally get it. As an overthinker, it can be tough to shake off those nagging thoughts and worries. And when you're sensitive to what others say, it can be especially challenging. I'm happy to help you with some strategies to speed up the calming process.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you're an overthinker and sensitive to others' words is a huge step forward. Recognizing your patterns and triggers is key to making changes.\n\nHere are some techniques that might help you calm down faster:\n\n1. **Mindfulness meditation**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you develop greater awareness of your thoughts and emotions. You can try guided meditations or apps like Headspace or Calm to get started. Even 5-10 minute sessions can be beneficial.\n2. **Label and accept**: When you start to feel upset, try labeling your emotions (e.g., \"I'm feeling anxious/ upset/ frustrated\"). Acknowledge the feeling, and accept it as a normal response. This can help you detach from the emotions and observe them more objectively.\n3. **Reframe and reframe again**: Challenge those negative thoughts by reframing them in a more balanced or positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"They must think I'm incompetent,\" try reframing it as \"They might have been having a bad day, and their comment wasn't personal.\"\n4. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that everyone has bad days and that you're doing the best you can.\n5. **Physical release**: Engage in physical activities that help you release tension, such as yoga, stretching, or a brisk walk. Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n6. **Boundary-setting**: Establish clear boundaries with others to protect your emotional well-being. Learn to say \"no\" or \"I'd prefer not to discuss this\" when you feel overwhelmed.\n7. **Sleep hygiene**: Prioritize a consistent sleep schedule, and establish a relaxing bedtime routine to improve sleep quality. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.\n8. **Progress, not perfection**: Don't expect to stop thinking about the issue immediately. Instead, focus on making progress each day. Celebrate small victories, and remind yourself that it's okay to take time to process your emotions.\n9. **Seek support**: Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend/family member about your struggles. Sharing your concerns with someone who understands can help you feel heard and validated.\n10. **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath.\n\nRemember, it might take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With time and practice, you can develop healthier coping mechanisms to manage your emotions and thoughts.\n\nLastly, try to focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.

There are limits to those, sometimes severe ones.\n\nThat said, some general tips:\n\n1) Get a drivers license. Seriously. You don't need insurance if you don't have a car, but having a license makes it easier to borrow one, and once you're an adult, rent one, on an as-needed basis. It doubles as official ID.\n\n2) Know the limits on that power of attorney doc. It will vary from place to place. \n\n3) Get a job. Seriously. You're going to need money of some sort. Just living at your sisters place on your parents dime will get really old, really fast, for her. (Possibly you as well.) You don't need much, but you need something.\n4) Make your bed, clean your room, do your dishes, take out the trash, pay your bills on time, balance your budget, etc. All those things. They're chores. They're no fun. Do them anyways. Do them on a regular basis, so they become life-long good habits. \n\n5) Help out around the place. You're going to be a long-term guest in your sisters place. Emotions are going to get on each others nerves. Being genuinely helpful around the house will help keep that stuff under control. It will still happen, but it won't be as bad. It'll also reinforce the good habits I referenced above.\n\n6) Get out of the house! Go be out there. See the world. Don't spend all your time at home playing video games/watching TV/whatever.\n\n7) Spend time IN the house, but out of your room. Be social with the people you live with. Play cards together. Pick a TV show to watch through together, something you do on a regular basis.\n\n8) Cook your own meals/Help out with meal prep. Yes, going out for a burger is fast and easy. It also is expensive and will do nothing for your health. You're young, you won't notice it for a few years, but it will happen.\n\n9) If you've got someone you want to bring home for the night, give sis a heads up BEFORE hand. You really don't want her screaming at the person first thing Saturday morning while you're taking a leak.\n\n10) Know that she'll worry about you. Text/call/whatever, so she knows where you're at and what's going on. She'll likely be giving updates on you to your parents. You want them to know what's up too.\n\n11) Write/call/etc your mom and dad. Seriously. They're helping make this happen. They want you to succeed. Make sure you work to keep them involved in your life.\n\n12) Save as much money as you can, without being a scrooge about it. Contribute to the household bills.\n\n13) Know that you're going to make mistakes. Be prepared to own the mistakes, apologize for them, and work to not make them again.\n\nOther than that, you're going to be moving out. The world is opening up for you.

This will help you manage your finances independently and avoid mixing your personal and living expenses. Consider setting up automatic transfers for bills, savings, and expenses.\n2. **Utilities and services:** Set up or transfer your utility accounts (electricity, water, internet, phone) in your name. This might require a deposit, so be prepared for that.\n3. **Insurance:** Although you're not getting a driver's license, you might still need insurance for other aspects of your life, such as renters insurance or health insurance. Research your options and explore what's available to you.\n4. **Rent and lease:** Make sure you understand the terms of your lease or rental agreement. Review the contract, know your rights and responsibilities, and ask your landlord or property manager any questions you may have.\n5. **Job and income:** Are you planning to work or attend school? If so, make sure you have a steady income or a plan in place to cover your expenses. Consider opening a savings account specifically for emergency funds.\n6. **Mental and emotional preparation:** Moving out can be overwhelming, especially at 17. Make time for self-care, prioritize your mental health, and build a support network of friends, family, or a therapist.\n7. **Logistics:** Pack and organize your belongings, and plan how you'll transport them to your new place. You might need to rent a moving truck or hire professional movers.\n8. **Notify important parties:** Update your address with the post office, schools, and any relevant institutions or organizations (e.g., student loans, credit cards, or subscriptions).\n9. **Create a budget:** Establish a budget that accounts for your income, expenses, and savings. This will help you stay on track and avoid financial stress.\n10. **Stay organized:** Keep important documents, contacts, and records in a secure and accessible place. This will help you stay organized and prepared for any unexpected situations.\n\nBy tackling these tasks, you'll be better prepared for your new life as an independent 17-year-old.

So here I go.\n\nI'm 26M, Mom 45F, My sister, 19F and youngest brother 9M.\n\nMy dad passed away 5 years ago. Before he passed on, he left us A home and a piece of land that he put it under my name, the house was on my mom's name. We were in debt(not a lot) The land was bigger than the house.  After my dad passed away, I had a talk with my mom. We decided it was best to sell the house(decent 6 figures) and pay off debts, finish my studies and try to build another house in that barren land. That area was developing and value was going up. My mom is a 3 time Stroke survivor who's now in a wheelchair because she had an accident few months ago.\n\nI joined work soon after my dad's death. I have an uncle I'm close to and with his help, I was able to construct a 3 storied building. We rented out 2 and moved in one.  As dad was NOT around anymore, I decided that it was not fair that I get the building all by myself. My mom and dad had a love marriage. Mom was devastated and talked me about my sibling's future. I assured her that it was my responsibility now to take care of my siblings and her. I was talking to split the building in future.\n\n Here is the problem. My sister considered her a disney princess. Won't lift a finger, blast loud music we received noise complaints, will disrespect mom and me. Continuously ask for money even though we give her an allowance. She's friends with my ex gf who cheated on me. She knew but decided not to tell me because \"it's cool and happens all the time\"\n\nI ultimately decided that if she wanted to stay, she must cease disrespecting me and mom inside my house. She yelled that it was her house too as Dad left it. I told her dad left it land, I made it home. I gave her and ultimatum that she needs to move out by next year. Mom is saddened by it. We are immigrants in this country. Mom is worried about her safety and doesn't want her to leave. I told her that she must. I can't take the disrespect anymore. I told her that I will try to find some work for her so she can at least try to make a living instead of living off my money and yelling at me. \n\n\nI pay for literally everything. Taxes, Bills, Groceries, Loan repayments, education, car loan. I can't afford to give her 1.2k each month to spend lavishly. My sister told me that my GF was right to cheat on an asshole like me. Mom tells me she's worried and I might have gone a bit out of line with asking her to move out. I don't know the right course of action I should take now. She's becoming a spoilt child. She tells me she needs her own car and I told her to work for one. Is there any way I can handle this without having to hurt anyone?\n\nTl;dr: My younger sister disrespected me and mom in my house. I told her she needs to move out but I think it was not right because this land belongs to our dad and I feel I'm being an asshole about it. Can I handle this without a conflict?",
    "human_response": "I don't understand why she is given an allowance at all...

You're the one (as a sibling not a parent) providing her unnecessary luxury. I don't know why she got an allowance in the first place, but now she is abusing it because she doesn't see the true value of the hard work put in to making that money.\n\nI personally never got an allowance and my parents are well off. I got a part time job in high school, then went to college (paying 90% of it on my own). I know how hard you have to work to get nice things. But I still could not survive without my parents help to put a roof over my head in this economy...\n\nShe is acting like a child, so treat her as one.

    "model_response": "Wow, that's a lot to unpack! I can sense the emotional weight of this situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for taking responsibility for your siblings and your mom, especially given the challenging circumstances. It's admirable that you're trying to provide for them.\n\nRegarding your sister, it's understandable that you're frustrated with her behavior. It's not acceptable to disrespect you and your mom, and it's not fair that she's taking advantage of your generosity. It's great that you're setting boundaries, but I agree that asking her to move out might be a bit harsh, especially given your mom's concerns about her safety.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of asking her to move out, consider having a more nuanced conversation with her. Acknowledge her feelings and the fact that she's still grieving the loss of your dad. Explain to her that you understand she's struggling, but her behavior is unacceptable and you need to set boundaries. You could also offer to help her find a job or a way to contribute to the household expenses.\n\nRegarding the property, it's true that your dad left the land to you, but it's also understandable that your mom feels a strong emotional connection to the house. Perhaps you could have a conversation with your mom about finding a way to make her feel more included in the decision-making process or finding a compromise that works for everyone.\n\nAs for your mom's concerns about your sister's safety, it's understandable that she's worried. However, it's also important to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries. You can reassure your mom that you'll continue to support your sister, but you need to set boundaries to maintain a healthy living environment.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to have a conversation with your ex-girlfriend about her behavior. It's understandable that she knew about your sister's friends with her, but it's not okay to keep it from you. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her actions had on your relationship.\n\nIn terms of finding a way to handle this without hurting anyone, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Practice active listening: Make sure you're hearing everyone's concerns and feelings before responding.\n2. Set clear boundaries: Be firm but respectful in your communication.\n3. Seek mediation: Consider having a neutral third party help facilitate conversations between you, your mom, and your sister.\n4. Focus on solutions: Instead of dwelling on the past or blaming each other, try to focus on finding solutions that work for everyone.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and prioritize your own well-being in this situation. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this challenging time.",

I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem or potential problem.  My political and nonreligious views starkly contrast those of my immediate family, and presidential campaign season is in full swing.  When talking to most people, if they try to bring up religion or politics you can usually dismiss the topic fairly easily simply by saying you don't want to talk about it, you're not comfortable with it, or you don't really have an opinion.  However, when dealing with anyone who has a vested interest in the topic and/or you as a person, it's much more challenging.  I'll use my own situation as an example.  If my dad were to ask me something as simple as \"who are you voting for in the primaries,\" I don't see any good options: If I tell him what I actually think, it'll start a debate and I'm extremely non-confrontational (trying to argue with me will get you a deer in headlights reaction and an emotional meltdown if the demand for argument continues past that point), and the rest of my family would look down on me for committing wrongthink.  If I say I don't know/have an opinion he'll insist that it's a very simple matter to learn about the various candidates and make a decision (which isn't all wrong) and that I'm lazy and shirking my duty as a US citizen to be an informed political participant.  If I say I don't care, I'll get much the same response as not having an opinion but harsher, since having an active disinterest in politics would be worse than just not knowing what to think.  If I try to say that I don't want to/am not comfortable with having such a discussion, that will throw up a big red flag and lead to targeted, probing questions directed at me.  I can't think of any good way out of this scenario and all of the ways I can think of require lying, something I'm also not comfortable with but admittedly is better than confrontation.",

It can be challenging to navigate these types of conversations, especially when they involve family members who have strong opinions and expectations. Here are a few strategies you can try to tactfully exit these conversations:\n\n1. Acknowledge their interest: Start by acknowledging your family member's interest in the topic and expressing your respect for their opinions. This can help set a positive tone for the conversation.\n\nExample: \"I know you're really passionate about politics, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'd rather not discuss my personal opinions on the matter.\"\n\n2. Change the subject: If your family member is pushing for a discussion, try to steer the conversation towards a different topic. This can be as simple as asking about their interests, hobbies, or recent events.\n\nExample: \"Speaking of [related topic], have you heard about [new development]?\"\n\n3. Use the \"I'm not an expert\" card: If your family member is asking for your opinion or trying to persuade you to adopt their views, you can politely say that you're not an expert in the field and don't feel comfortable sharing your opinion.\n\nExample: \"I appreciate your perspective, but I'm not really familiar with the details of the issue. I don't feel comfortable sharing my opinion without doing more research.\"\n\n4. Set boundaries: If your family member continues to press you for a discussion, it's okay to set clear boundaries. You can say something like:\n\nExample: \"I understand that you're interested in discussing this topic, but I'm not comfortable doing so. Can we focus on other topics?\"\n\n5. Practice active listening: Sometimes, people may feel the need to discuss sensitive topics to feel heard and understood. If your family member is bringing up a topic that's important to them, try to listen actively and show empathy. This can help de-escalate tension and reduce the need for confrontation.\n\nExample: \"I understand why this topic is important to you, and I appreciate your passion. However, I'd rather not discuss it further.\"\n\n6. Seek common ground: If your family member is pushing for a discussion, try to find common ground or shared values that you both can agree on. This can help shift the focus away from contentious topics and towards more positive conversations.\n\nExample: \"I understand that we may have different opinions on this issue, but I think we both value [shared value]. Let's focus on that instead.\"\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries in these situations. It's not necessary to engage in discussions that make you uncomfortable or compromise your values. By being respectful, empathetic, and assertive, you can navigate these conversations with tact and maintain positive relationships.",

Instead, wait for a time when they seem more calm and receptive.\n\nWhen you do talk to them, focus on expressing your feelings and concerns, rather than getting defensive or argumentative.

Can we please find a way to communicate that's more respectful and understanding? I want to work with you to find a solution, but I need some space and respect to do so.\"\n\nIt's also important to set some boundaries for yourself. Since you're grounded, it's okay to ask your parents to respect your personal space and give you some quiet time.

Once you're aware of your triggers, you can start working on addressing them.\n2. **Practice relaxation techniques**: When you feel anxious or stressed, take a few deep breaths, and try to relax your body. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or meditation to calm your mind and body.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of viewing conflicts as threats, try to see them as opportunities to communicate and resolve issues. Remind yourself that conflicts are a natural part of any relationship or situation, and that you can learn and grow from them.\n4. **Develop assertive communication skills**: Practice using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, instead of saying \"You're being too loud,\" say \"I'm having trouble sleeping because of the noise, could you please keep it down?\"\n5. **Start small**: Begin with small, low-stakes conflicts, like asking a friend to turn down the music or asking a coworker to pass you a pen. As you become more comfortable, you can work your way up to more significant conflicts.\n6. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your fears and concerns. They can offer support, guidance, and help you develop a plan to overcome your fears.\n7. **Practice assertive responses**: Role-play different scenarios with a friend or family member. Practice responding assertively, but also respectfully, to different situations.\n8. **Focus on your values**: Remember why you're trying to overcome your fear of conflicts. What are your values? Are you trying to stand up for yourself, or to improve a situation? Keeping your values in mind can help you stay motivated and focused.\n9. **Take small steps**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Take small steps towards overcoming your fear of conflicts. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem, and use them as motivation to continue improving.\n10. **Be patient**: Overcoming a fear of conflicts takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.\n\nIn your specific situations, here are some additional suggestions:\n\n* When driving, try to focus on your own driving and the road ahead, rather than worrying about other drivers. If someone is tailgating you, try to maintain a safe distance and avoid engaging with them.\n* When dealing with noisy neighbors, try to approach the situation calmly and respectfully. You can start by talking to them in person, or sending a polite note explaining the issue. If the problem persists, consider talking to your landlord or local authorities for assistance.\n\nRemember, overcoming a fear of conflicts takes time, effort, and practice. Be patient, stay focused, and don't be afraid to ask for help along the way.",

So I don't know if it's a typical bitchy thing that women do, or whether she just doesn't have other friends or interesting things to talk about but it seems my friend's GF has somewhat enjoyment of mentioning my Ex (of 5 years) whenever she can.\n- They weren't friends before, and have only really 'known' each other for less than a year so they aren't even close. \n- Her topics are always mundane AF. (makeup, my ex, exams or some irrelevant nonsense that no one really cares to hear about)\n- She talks about my ex on a regular basis, mentioning (again) mundane things like \"oh ___ and I are going shopping this weekend\", \"___ is writing a 6 hour exam today\", \"I want to plan a girls night out and invite ___\".\n\nNeed some advice here.

    "human_response": "Have you talked to her about it? There are lots of possible reasons she might be doing that. If you just honestly say hey, do you mind not talking about X in front of me anymore? Then she will probably stop. Don't get petty like the other responses are telling you to do.",
    "model_response": "I get it. It can be really frustrating and uncomfortable when someone you care about is dominating conversations with topics that aren't interesting or relevant.\n\nFirstly, it's not necessarily a \"typical\" thing that women do, and it's not about being \"bitchy.\" It's possible that your friend's girlfriend is simply not aware of the impact her behavior is having on you and others, or she might be trying to bond with your friend by talking about a shared interest (your ex).\n\nHere's the thing: people often talk about what they know or think is interesting, and if they don't have much else to share, they might lean on familiar topics. It's not necessarily a personal attack on you or your relationship.\n\nThat being said, it's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable and want to address the issue. Here's what you could try:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your friend: Sit down with your friend and express your concerns in a non-accusatory way. Let them know that you feel uncomfortable when their girlfriend talks about your ex, and that you'd appreciate it if they could steer the conversation in other directions. Be specific about how it makes you feel and how you'd like to avoid feeling left out or uncomfortable.\n2. Set boundaries with the girlfriend: If your friend's girlfriend continues to dominate conversations with your ex, it's okay to politely tell her that you're not interested in discussing it. You can say something like, \"Hey, I'm happy to catch up with you, but I'd rather not talk about my ex. Can we talk about something else?\"\n3. Find ways to engage in more interesting conversations: Try to steer the conversation towards topics that you're both interested in or passionate about. This can help shift the focus away from your ex and create a more positive atmosphere.\n\nRemember that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. By being open and honest with your friend and setting boundaries with the girlfriend, you can take back some control and create a more comfortable environment for yourself.",

    "model_response": "The age-old quest for happiness amidst life's ups and downs! I'm glad you asked.\n\nWhen something bad happens, it's natural to feel upset, angry, or hurt. But, as you said, it's crucial to not let it ruin your day or future days. Here are some tips to help you bounce back:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and accept your emotions**: Recognize how you feel, and give yourself permission to feel those emotions. Avoid suppressing or denying them, as this can prolong the negative impact.\n2. **Take a time-out**: Sometimes, it's essential to step away from the situation to clear your head and gather your thoughts. Take a short walk, do some deep breathing exercises, or engage in a relaxing activity to calm down.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect.\n4. **Reframe the situation**: Try to find a silver lining or a lesson to be learned from the experience. Focus on what you can control and what you can learn from the situation.\n5. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, engage in activities that bring you joy, and practice gratitude by reflecting on the good things in your life.\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past or future. Mindfulness techniques can help you stay grounded and centered.\n7. **Set boundaries**: If someone is consistently disrespecting or bullying you, it's essential to establish clear boundaries to protect your emotional well-being.\n8. **Seek support**: Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support and guidance. Sharing your feelings with someone who cares can help you process and heal.\n9. **Practice forgiveness**: Forgiveness is a process, and it may take time. Try to let go of resentment and anger, not for the other person's sake, but for yours. Holding onto negativity can weigh you down and prevent you from moving forward.\n10. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being by engaging in activities that nourish your body and soul. This can include exercise, meditation, or hobbies that bring you joy.\n\nRemember, bouncing back from adversity takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't immediately bounce back. With time, practice, and support, you can develop resilience and learn to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and happiness.",

It's normal to have strong connections with someone, especially when you've shared deep conversations and experiences. However, you're right to recognize that your feelings are partly rooted in a desire to nurture and mentor him, which is a beautiful quality.\n\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room: his girlfriend's pregnancy. You're absolutely right that he should take responsibility for his actions and support his partner, especially during this vulnerable time. As you said, good guys don't abandon their responsibilities, and it's essential to prioritize the well-being of the unborn child.\n\nGiven your strong feelings for him, it's understandable that you're struggling to stay distant.

You've taken the high road, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. Take time to process your emotions: It's okay to feel sad and miss him, but don't beat yourself up over it. Acknowledge your feelings, and allow yourself to grieve the potential loss of what could have been.\n2. Focus on self-care: Channel your energy into activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. This might include reconnecting with friends, pursuing hobbies, or taking care of your physical and mental health.\n3. Set boundaries at work: It's understandable that you're struggling to ignore him at work, but try to maintain a professional distance. Remember, your well-being is important, and you don't owe him any explanation or emotional labor.\n4. Practice self-reflection: Ask yourself what you've learned from this experience. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What do you want to prioritize in your next connection?\n5. Keep an open mind: You never know what the future holds, and it's possible that he'll come to his senses and prioritize his responsibilities. If that happens, you'll be ready to re-evaluate your feelings and potentially rekindle a connection.\n\nRemember, you've done the right thing by prioritizing his girlfriend's well-being and the unborn child's future.

By having this conversation, you can work together to find a solution that respects both of your boundaries and desires.\n\nLastly, it's worth considering whether your drinking habits are affecting your relationship dynamics or overall well-being. If you find that you're relying on drinking to feel more comfortable with intimacy, it might be worth exploring other ways to build connection and intimacy with your partner.",

    "sentence": "Please please please know that my boyfriend is a very good person and that I love him very much, but I feel like I\u2019m at my breaking point because I can\u2019t compete with his life anymore, and I really need some advice.\n\nFull disclosure: My boyfriend and I moved very quickly in our relationship. It was the type of instant and intense \u201clove at first sight\u201d where it felt almost uncanny how similar we were..\n\nI felt such an instant and intimate connection to him that I didn\u2019t think twice about quitting my career and moving to a different state with him quite quickly, and despite that risk it actually worked out really well until recently.\n\nI began noticing last winter that I felt more like an accessory to my boyfriend\u2019s life, and that he seemed like he was still living a bachelor life. The first major fracture of our relationship was when he merged businesses with a friend on a whim and moved cities to go work with him, meaning that instead of being home every night like he normally was, he was gone 3-4 days a week. I won\u2019t lie to say that I was furious. I wanted to be happy and supportive of his business decisions, but he made literally no effort in discussing this to me beforehand.\n\nThe next fracture came from something that I had signed up for willingly, but it has become a problem as I\u2019ve grown to start feeling resentful. My boyfriend owns a business with his family, who he is extremely close with. All of his time when he is back home gets put into the family business. In the beginning, I was really enthusiastic about this business, and I would volunteer time to get to know his parents and the community better, but now I want nothing to do with it because it feels like there\u2019s way too much expectation for me to engage with it.\n\nHis parents were very welcoming to me, and they entrusted me to do a lot with the business which I was happy to do, but now that my boyfriend is gone most of the week, it seems like even more of my time is being spent maintaining aspects of my boyfriend\u2019s life instead of me trying to carve a place for myself in my new home.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem that when my boyfriend is at home, all of his time goes into this family business, and so I feel even further away from the main cast of his life. Weirdly enough, now I\u2019m much closer with my boyfriend\u2019s sister than I am with my boyfriend, as her and I hang out and talk more than I do with him, which would be a lovely and beautiful thing if I also had that with my boyfriend, but instead I feel that if it weren\u2019t for his sister supporting me, I\u2019d be abandoned.\n\nFinally the last major fracture is the dog we have together. Our dog is a highly energetic breed and requires a lot of attention and time. This was no issue in the beginning and the dog always felt naturally like \u201cmy dog\u201d but it was the expectation that both my boyfriend and I would take care of her. Yet now our dog seems to have been back-seated, just like me. \n\nFor example, if I\u2019ve asked my boyfriend to watch the dog because I\u2019m vacuuming or cooking or even want time by myself, he will take her for 20 minutes and then eventually lose concentration until she comes to find me in hopes I will play with her.\n\nI actually had a bit of a freakout about this when my boyfriend and I were invited to a big family celebration a few weeks ago. I told my boyfriend that I didn\u2019t want to bring the dog because she is way too excitable around people and I just wanted to focus on meeting some of his extended family and making a good first impression with them, since he is so close to his family. My boyfriend begged me to take the dog with us because he missed her.\n\nI reluctantly agreed, only because he swore that \u201che would take care of her and that there would be a lot of other dogs there.\u201d My boyfriend also promised he wouldn\u2019t drink because my car was in the shop and we had to drive his vehicle, which is standard and something I can\u2019t drive because I never learned how to drive stick. \n\nWe show up, and embarrassingly we are the only people there with a dog. My boyfriend abandoned me almost immediately to spend time and to catch up with his family members, who I couldn\u2019t meet because my dog is extremely excitable around people, so I have to stay in the outer circle of the fun with her so that she can remain relaxed. \n\nWorse yet is the hostess, and a few people who helped her set up, swung by and commented that \u201cthey were hoping that this would be a no-dog party\u201d and that \u201cthey would make sure I know next time when dogs aren\u2019t allowed\u201d and it felt so awfully embarrassing to me that I nearly cried. \n\nThere I was, all alone at a party where I don\u2019t know anyone, with an animal tied to my hand which clearly was extremely unwelcomed, and to make it worse now looks like it was my idea because I\u2019m hanging on the sidelines avoiding people instead of socializing.\n\nEven more devastating was when I did finally find my boyfriend, he was already halfway to being drunk, to which he laughed and said to me \u201cwe can just take a taxi!\u201d Through gritted teeth, I then told him \u201cWe can\u2019t. We have the dog!\u201d \n\nThe only thing that saved us was my boyfriend\u2019s extremely nice uncle, who I think was a mind reader or something. He came up to me, as I was nearly in tears and asked me how I was getting home. I explained the situation and he gave me the keys to his car so that me, the dog and my boyfriend could get home that night.\n\nThat last situation very much felt like the final straw and we had a massive blow out about it. It wasn\u2019t the first conversation we had about this type of thing, and yet over and over and over again my boyfriend keeps telling me \u201cI\u2019m #1\u201d and \u201ctell me what to do so I can change.\u201d\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to be that person who is the dictator in someone else\u2019s life and keep putting up ultimatums. I don\u2019t want to have to feel like I\u2019m competing with someone else\u2019s life or like I have to explain to them how to treat me like a girlfriend instead of just some afterthought.\n\nWe had a conversation again last night where I told him I was unhappy, and I asked him if he understood why. I was hoping, praying, that from all of our conversations he would know. And yet all he could say was that he could tell I was unhappy in our relationship but he didn\u2019t understand what for.\n\nI went numb. It feels like if I walked out tomorrow nothing in his life would change, except maybe he wouldn\u2019t have to have conversations anymore about how impossible it is to make me happy.\n\nI just feel like an accessory and it hurts so bad.\n\nYet I still don\u2019t know if this relationship is worth giving up because my boyfriend does love me and we align so well in our life goals. \n\nI finally broke down and spilled the beans to his sister, who calmly said \u201cMy brother is a good man and I can see he loves you very much, but he\u2019s always been immature in his relationships and his idea of compromising is him saying he\u2019s willing to compromise.\u201d She then told me that she would support me no matter what I do.\n\nDoes anyone know what I can do?\n\nHas anyone ever felt like an accessory in their relationship?\n\n**TL;DR:** My boyfriend continues to live his life as a bachelor despite me living with him and us building a life together. He makes big decisions by himself without talking to me about them, and I feel like I have to run his life when he\u2019s gone. His total freedom in his life makes me feel chained to maintaining our relationship instead of us being equal life partners. Is it over?",
    "human_response": "Yes. I was an accessory in an ex\u2019s life. He wasn\u2019t willing to carve out a life for us, I was there peripherally, entirely on his terms. He \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d why I was unhappy either.  It\u2019s because he and your boyfriend ARE living the lives they want.

    "model_response": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds incredibly frustrating and painful.\n\nFirstly, let me acknowledge that it's normal to feel like an accessory in a relationship, especially when one partner seems to be prioritizing their own life over the partnership. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with balancing their own needs with those of their partner.\n\nThat being said, it's clear that you've been feeling this way for a while now, and it's taking a toll on your mental and emotional well-being. It's essential to prioritize your own needs and happiness in this relationship.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Communicate your needs clearly**: Instead of giving ultimatums, try to have open and honest conversations with your boyfriend about your feelings and needs. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel, rather than attacking or blaming him. For example, \"I feel left out when you make decisions without consulting me\" or \"I feel like I'm carrying the load of our relationship when you're away.\"\n2. **Set boundaries**: It's essential to establish boundaries and prioritize your own time and energy. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure you're taking care of yourself and making time for your own interests and hobbies.\n3. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for emotional support. Talking to someone who can offer a fresh perspective can be incredibly helpful.\n4. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take some time to reflect on what you want from this relationship and what your non-negotiables are. Are there specific changes you'd like to see in your boyfriend's behavior? Are there aspects of the relationship that you're willing to compromise on?\n5. **Consider couples therapy**: If you feel like you've tried everything and still feel unheard and unvalued, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through these issues.\n\nRemember, you deserve to feel seen, heard, and valued in your relationship. It's okay to take the time you need to figure out what's best for you, even if that means re-evaluating the relationship.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that your boyfriend's sister's words were incredibly insightful. It's possible that your boyfriend has a pattern of immaturity in his relationships, and it's essential to consider whether you're willing to invest in a relationship that may not have the potential for growth and change.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this feeling. Many people have felt like an accessory in their relationships, and it's okay to seek help and support to find a more balanced and fulfilling partnership.",

    "model_response": "I totally get it. It can be really tough when you don't click with your sibling's partner, especially when it seems like others in your family don't get along with them either. It's understandable that you want to maintain a relationship with your brother, but also feel concerned about his well-being and the dynamic with his partner.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to have differing opinions and not like someone. It doesn't mean you're a bad person or that you're being unreasonable. It's normal to have reservations about someone who's close to your sibling, especially if you've had negative experiences with them.\n\nFor yourself, I'd suggest setting some boundaries to protect your own emotional well-being. If you find yourself getting angry or upset when thinking about your brother's partner, try to take a step back and acknowledge those feelings. Recognize that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you react to the situation.\n\nConsider having an open and honest conversation with your brother about your concerns. Approach the conversation calmly and avoid being accusatory or judgmental. You might say something like, \"Hey bro, I've noticed that I don't really connect with [partner's name] and I'm worried about how this might affect our relationship. Can we talk about what's going on and how we can navigate this?\" This can help clear the air and give your brother a chance to share his perspective.\n\nAs for your family members, it's understandable that you don't want to engage in petty drama or social media feuds. Instead, focus on nurturing positive relationships with those who are supportive and respectful. If someone in your family is causing tension or drama, it might be worth having a gentle but firm conversation with them about how their behavior is affecting you.\n\nLastly, try not to worry too much about what others think. You can't control how your brother's partner behaves, but you can control how you respond to the situation. Focus on maintaining a healthy relationship with your brother and setting boundaries that work for you. Remember that you're not responsible for fixing the situation or changing your brother's partner's behavior \u2013 your role is to support your brother and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have differences of opinion and not like someone. You don't have to be besties with your sibling's partner, but you can still love and support your brother.",

    "sentence": "TL;DR I lied to make my potentially dubious-looking friendships look less bad to my bf, wanting to avoid questioning. I knew that this was a dealbreaker for him. What can I do to fix this cycle?\n\nWe have had trust problems from 2 months ago when I avoided a question about my casual dating history. He questioned me until I told him that there were 2 guys I had hooked up with a year ago whom I still kept a distant platonic friendship with. He didn't trust me when I told him nothing had happened since and that the guys knew I was in a relationship, because I had tried to avoid telling him about them entirely. To fix this we decided I should tell the guys that I was in a relationship with my bf specifically. When he asked me to tell him what I had texted them, I lied that I had told them the full story when actually I had only started the conversation. I felt awkward dropping names with guys who didn't really care to know much about my relationships, and had intended to tell them about my bf in a longer chain of texts. Because of this further deception, we decided that to fix it I should cut the 2 guys out of my life, and I did.\n\nI just came back from a trip with my long-time close friend (28M). I told bf about this friend and how we had met when he tutored me when I was 12, and we had become friends for over 8 years now after ending the tutoring. My bf was suspicious of this friend being a creep and having groomer tendencies due to the age gap. In the midst of defending my friend, my bf asked how many rooms the Airbnb we stayed at on the trip had. I lied and said 2 when there had only been 1. In fact my friend and I are both in relationships and intended to sleep separately, and the place was advertised for 4 people, but the landlord made a mix-up with the sofabed that meant there was only 1 bed that we agreed to share. Absolutely nothing happened and boundaries were drawn, but in the moment I was afraid that my bf would have more reason to doubt my friendship, so I lied about the room situation. In hindsight it seems almost improbable that this chain of events leading to there being only 1 bed was coincidental, and I have no way of verifying this myself except for asking my friend for evidence.\n\nMy bf doesn't trust me and thinks I am a shitty person. I know trust is non-negotiable. In both situations I lied because I was afraid of the backlash from my bf of how my friendships looked, and believed I shouldn't receive suspicion about them because I have never crossed boundaries. But I have no excuse for crossing a line that is always worse than whatever I have to gain from avoiding the discomfort of a conversation. Can this be fixed?

Lying to avoid discomfort is a pattern that needs to change. You've hurt your partner's trust, and it's reasonable for them to feel that way.\n\nTo fix this cycle of deception, you need to have open and honest conversations with your partner. It's crucial to understand that your partner's concerns and doubts are valid, and it's your responsibility to address them. Be prepared to listen to their feelings and concerns, and be honest about your actions.\n\nYou should also consider seeking individual therapy to work on building self-awareness and developing healthier communication patterns. It's essential to recognize that your motivations for lying were rooted in fear and avoidance, and that's a pattern that needs to change.\n\nIn the short term, you need to have a thorough conversation with your partner about the lies, the reasons behind them, and the impact it's had on your relationship. Be prepared to apologize sincerely and make amends. It's crucial to be transparent and honest about your actions and intentions.\n\nIn the long term, you need to work on rebuilding trust by being consistent and truthful in your communication. This means being open and transparent about your friendships, relationships, and interactions. It's essential to prioritize your partner's feelings and concerns and be willing to address them head-on.\n\nTo stop this cycle of deception in the future, you need to recognize that honesty is always the best policy. It's better to have uncomfortable conversations and risk potential conflict than to continue lying and risking the erosion of trust. You need to focus on building a foundation of trust and respect in your relationship by being truthful and authentic.\n\nRemember, it's not about avoiding discomfort or fear; it's about being honest and authentic in your interactions. It's okay to make mistakes, but it's how you learn from them and grow that matters.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can. It's not easy to break patterns of deception, but it's essential to prioritize your own growth and well-being in the process.",

Here's what I want you to know: it's normal to feel that way, and it's okay to not have all the answers. But, there are some strategies that can help you stay positive, level-headed, and find your way forward.\n\nFirst, acknowledge your emotions. Recognize that you're feeling defeated and out of options, and give yourself permission to feel that way. Don't try to suppress or deny your emotions, as that can lead to more stress and anxiety.\n\nNext, take a step back and assess the situation. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the chaos that we can't see the forest for the trees. Take a deep breath, and try to identify what's really going on. What are the root causes of your feelings of defeat? Is it a specific situation, person, or goal that's causing you distress? Once you have a better understanding of what's going on, you can start to break it down into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nNow, here's a crucial part: take action. Don't just sit there feeling defeated. Do something, no matter how small it may seem. It could be as simple as taking a shower, going for a walk, or making a cup of tea. Sometimes, taking action can help shift our perspective and give us a sense of control.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that you don't have to have all the answers right now. It's okay to not know what to do or where to go. In fact, it's okay to ask for help. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor about what you're going through. They may be able to offer valuable insights, advice, or support.\n\nFinally, practice self-care. Take care of your physical and emotional needs. Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise, and do things that bring you joy and relaxation. When we take care of ourselves, we're better equipped to handle the challenges that come our way.\n\nRemember, feeling defeated and out of options is a normal part of life. It's how we respond to those feelings that matters. By acknowledging our emotions, taking action, seeking help, and practicing self-care, we can find our way forward and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nHow does that sound?

I consider him a friend, and I value our friendship. I would have asked anyone else who was nearby to help me, not just him.\"\n3. Set boundaries: Let your sister know that you won't engage in a conversation that makes you feel belittled or disrespected.

Address the group chat drama: Since your sister blocked you on social media, try to talk to her in person or over the phone.

I am not against the idea of him finding new female friends in general, but i do feel suspicious of their friendship because they see each other quite regularly (about once a week, they live 1 minute apart). I currently only see him once a week as well. And they exclusively meet in the evenings or at nighttime by themselves in either of their apartments while drinking alcohol and watching a movie on a couch or bed.\n\nI told him that i am uncomfortable with him doing that and that i'd feel much safer if they met during daytime or at another place that isn't either of their apartments. However he refuses to compromise and accused me of having trust issues. He claims that they can only meet up in private places because she has \"serious issues\" that he wants to listen to and help with, and they're apparently serious enough that i am not allowed to know about them.

    "model_response": "I'm glad you came to me with your concerns! It's completely understandable that you're feeling uneasy about the situation.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're communicating your feelings and concerns to your boyfriend. It takes a lot of courage to address potential issues in a relationship.\n\nRegarding your concerns, I'd say you're not being crazy at all. It's normal to feel uneasy when your partner is spending a lot of time with someone of the opposite sex, especially if it's a new friend. The fact that they're meeting up frequently, exclusively, and in private settings can raise some red flags.\n\nIt's also reasonable to feel suspicious given that your boyfriend is being secretive about their conversations and activities. His refusal to compromise or discuss his concerns with you further is also a red flag.\n\nIt's important to remember that relationships are built on trust, communication, and mutual respect. If your boyfriend is unwilling to work with you to address your concerns, it may indicate that he's not prioritizing your feelings or the health of your relationship.\n\nI'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. You can express your feelings and boundaries in a non-accusatory way, focusing on how you feel rather than attacking him or his friend. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I've noticed that you and your new friend have been spending a lot of time together, and I'm feeling a bit uneasy about it. I understand that you want to help her with her issues, but I'd feel more comfortable if you met during the day or in a more public place. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?\"\n\nIt's also important to consider whether your boyfriend is being honest with you about his friend's issues. If he's not willing to share more information or provide more context, it may be worth exploring whether he's being truthful about the nature of their friendship.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what you're comfortable with in your relationship. If your boyfriend is unwilling to work with you to address your concerns, it may be a sign that it's time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nRemember, you deserve to feel safe and respected in your relationship.

    "model_response": "I totally get what you're saying! Dealing with tactless people can be frustrating, especially when they seem oblivious to the impact of their words. Here are a few suggestions on how to handle these situations:\n\n1. Practice active listening: Sometimes, people might not realize the harm they're causing because they're not fully listening to the other person's perspective. Try to focus on what they're saying and respond thoughtfully, rather than getting defensive.\n\nExample: \"Hey, I appreciate your concern, but I'd prefer it if you could rephrase that. Saying I look awful can be hurtful, and I'd rather we focus on more positive interactions.\"\n\n2. Set clear boundaries: It's essential to communicate your boundaries clearly and respectfully. You can do this by saying something like:\n\nExample: \"I understand you're trying to be friendly, but comments about my appearance make me feel uncomfortable. Could we focus on other topics?\"\n\n3. Reframe their comments: Sometimes, people say things without realizing the impact. You can try reframing their comments to help them understand how their words might be perceived.\n\nExample: \"I get that you're trying to be funny, but saying I look awful can come across as hurtful. How about we focus on something else?\"\n\n4. Practice assertive responses: When someone says something tactless, you can respond assertively by saying something like:\n\nExample: \"I understand that was your intention, but I'd appreciate it if you could be more considerate with your words. Let's focus on more positive interactions.\"\n\n5. Limit interactions: If someone consistently disregards your boundaries and continues to be tactless, it might be necessary to limit your interactions with them. Prioritize self-care and surround yourself with people who uplift and support you.\n\nRemember, you don't have to tolerate disrespect or rudeness. By setting clear boundaries, practicing active listening, and reframing comments, you can navigate these situations with confidence and respect.",

Keep putting yourself out there, and eventually, you'll find people who share your values and interests.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of online communities. There are many online forums and social media groups dedicated to various topics and interests.

Where very close and to her it\u2019s just me in her family. I decided I wanted to move out for college with a friend and get an apartment in the city but since then my mom has been torn and never even wanted me to move out in the first place. She\u2019s lived alone since and said how much she miss me and wants me to move back in but today she called and was crying on the phone how lonely she is and how afraid she is and wants me to consider moving back in when my lease is up though I\u2019ve been planning for me and my gf to then move in which again she\u2019s not fond of. I visit her each week between school and work but she\u2019s still sad. What do I do, I don\u2019t like my mom being so lonely and sad but then again I\u2019m almost 20 and should live my own life?",

    "model_response": "I can sense the complexity of this situation! It's wonderful that you're considering your mom's feelings, but also thinking about your own needs and desires. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your mom is feeling lonely and scared, and that's a valid emotional response. As you've mentioned, she's used to having you around and may not have adjusted to the new dynamic. It's okay to acknowledge her feelings, but also remember that you're an adult now, and it's okay to prioritize your own life.\n\nHere's a suggestion: have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your feelings and plans. You can express your understanding of her sadness and loneliness, but also reiterate your desire to live your own life and build your own independence. You can say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I know you're feeling lonely and scared, and I'm sorry to hear that. I want you to know that I'm doing well and happy, but I also need to prioritize my own life and independence. I've made commitments to myself and my partner, and I don't want to jeopardize those. I understand that you might not like the idea of me living with my partner, but I hope you can understand that this is a normal part of growing up and building a life.\n\n\"I want to find a compromise that works for both of us. Can we discuss other ways I can visit you more often, or spend quality time together when I'm not in school? I value our relationship, but I also need to prioritize my own needs and desires.\"\n\nBy being honest and open, you're showing your mom that you care about her feelings, but also that you're not willing to sacrifice your own well-being. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs, and I'm sure your mom will understand that as well.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be firm but kind in your communication. You're not being selfish by wanting to live your own life; you're being responsible and adult. Keep in mind that your mom may need time to adjust to this new reality, but with open communication and empathy, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you.",

    "model_response": "What a wonderful opportunity! With a week to recharge, you can do some amazing things to refresh yourself and set yourself up for a less stressful period ahead.

You can always respond to urgent messages later.\n2. **Get moving**: Engage in physical activities that bring you joy, like going for a hike, taking a yoga class, or practicing meditation. Exercise releases endorphins, which can boost your mood and energy levels.\n3. **Sleep in and prioritize rest**: Allow yourself to sleep in and catch up on lost sleep. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help your body and mind recharge.\n4. **Nourish your body**: Focus on whole, nutritious foods and healthy snacks. Avoid processed and high-sugar foods that can drain your energy. You can try meal prep or cooking simple, comforting meals.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Schedule time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading a book, taking a relaxing bath, or getting a massage.\n6. **Reconnect with nature**: Spend time outdoors, whether it's taking a walk, having a picnic, or simply sitting in a park or backyard. Being in nature can be calming and rejuvenating.\n7. **Reflect and plan**: Take some time to reflect on your goals, priorities, and values. Write down what you're grateful for and what you're looking forward to. Plan your next steps, and make a to-do list for the upcoming busy period.\n\nRemember, this is your time to recharge and prioritize your well-being. Don't overplan or overcommit; leave some space for spontaneity and relaxation. By taking care of yourself now, you'll be better equipped to handle the challenges ahead.",

    "model_response": "The eternal struggle of being content with what you have while still being curious about what could be out there! It's completely normal to feel this way, and I'm here to offer some advice that might help.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to have these thoughts. It's natural to wonder about what could be, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem arises when this curiosity starts to consume you and makes you unhappy with what you already have.\n\nTo address this, I'd suggest setting aside dedicated time to indulge in your \"what if\" thoughts. Maybe set aside 15-20 minutes a week to daydream about other possibilities, and then consciously shift your focus back to your current situation. This will help you acknowledge and process your feelings without letting them take over.\n\nAnother strategy is to practice gratitude. Make a conscious effort to focus on the positive aspects of your current situation. Write down three things you appreciate about your girlfriend, your phone, or your current computer. This can help shift your focus from what's missing to what you already have.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the grass is not always greener on the other side. People often present their highlight reels on social media, making it easy to compare and feel like others have it better. Remember that everyone has their own struggles and imperfections, and what you have might be perfect for you in ways you're not even aware of.\n\nLastly, consider the concept of \"good enough.\" Sometimes, it's okay to settle for good enough, especially when you're already happy with what you have. It's not about settling for mediocrity, but about recognizing that perfect might not exist, and that what you have is still valuable.\n\nIn your specific situation, it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and not acting on them impulsively. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize when you're feeling restless, and that's a huge step towards finding contentment.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take time to adjust to a new mindset. But by acknowledging your thoughts, practicing gratitude, and focusing on what you already have, you can work towards being more satisfied with what you have and less consumed by the \"what ifs.\"",

Here are some tips that might help you set boundaries without coming across as emotional or bitchy:\n\n1. **Set a mental boundary**: Before engaging with these individuals, remind yourself that you don't owe them an exhaustive biography. You can silently acknowledge their curiosity without feeling obligated to share every detail.\n2. **Use the \"three-question rule\"**: When they start asking questions, respond to the first three questions they ask, and then politely steer the conversation back to their interests or the original topic. This helps you maintain control without being rude.\n3. **Practice active listening**: Show genuine interest in their lives and respond thoughtfully to their questions. This will help them feel heard and valued, which can reduce the likelihood of them becoming too intrusive.\n4. **Use \"gray rock\" responses**: When asked a question you're not comfortable answering, respond with a neutral, non-committal statement like, \"That's a good question,\" or \"I've been thinking about that a lot lately.\" This can help shift the focus away from prying and onto more general topics.\n5. **Avoid giving too much information**: When they do ask a question, be mindful of how much you're sharing. Try to keep your responses brief and don't feel pressured to reveal more than you're comfortable sharing.\n6. **Redirect the conversation**: If you notice the conversation becoming too intense or invasive, try changing the subject or asking them a question in return. This can help shift the focus away from your personal life and onto more neutral topics.\n7. **Use humor (carefully)**: If you're comfortable with it, you can use humor to diffuse the situation. For example, you could say something like, \"Wow, you're really curious about my life! I'm impressed.\" However, be cautious not to come across as flippant or dismissive.\n8. **Be firm but polite**: If someone continues to push for information despite your attempts to set boundaries, it's okay to be direct and assertive. You can say something like, \"I appreciate your interest, but I'd rather not discuss that topic further. Can we talk about something else?\"\n\nRemember, assertiveness doesn't have to be aggressive or confrontational. It's about being clear and respectful while maintaining your boundaries.\n\nAs for your concern about being perceived as emotional or bitchy, it's true that your age and appearance may influence how your words are received. However, assertiveness is not about being aggressive; it's about being clear and direct. Focus on your intentions and tone, and try to convey that you're coming from a place of respect and self-respect.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries.

And to be clear, I don't care about the past and how many bodies a girl has, as long as she is honest from the jump.\n\nVery early when we started dating, she told me her body count pretty early on (it was 3) and was very transparent about her past dating / sexual experiences really without me even asking or prodding. Mentioned that she hadn't dated for a whole year and a half before seeing me. Collectively, I found her confiding strange, because it's pretty sensitive information, and I found it weird that she felt so comfortable telling me her count without me even asking. She didn't even proceed to ask what mine was. I also just find it crazy because she is so extroverted and quite attractive...but only has a body count of 3 before me?\n\nAnyhow, there's some things that make me feel like things aren't adding up. First, she was very willing to get sexual early on when we started dating.

We had sex within a month I think.\n\nShe mentioned really liking a guy before me that she dated for a month, but he ghosted her. And she said they only ever kissed. She liked this guy so much, but they only kissed - while she invited me to her room on the second date? It just doesn't seem to add up.\n\nI don't want to assume she is lying, but is this peculiar?

Transparency is a significant aspect of any relationship, and it's excellent that she felt comfortable sharing this information with you.\n\nRegarding the inconsistencies, you're right to be skeptical. The fact that she invited you to her room on the second date, after not dating for a year and a half, does seem unusual. The story about the guy who ghosted her, only kissing her, while she was comfortable having sex with you early on, does raise some red flags.\n\nIt's not necessarily paranoid to question these inconsistencies, but it's also important to consider the possibility that there might be a logical explanation. Perhaps she was genuinely comfortable with you, and her past experiences didn't affect her in the same way. Maybe she's just more open about her feelings and desires with you.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that she might be hiding something. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. Approach the conversation calmly and non-accusatorily, focusing on your feelings and observations rather than making assumptions.\n\nAsk her about the inconsistencies, and listen to her response. Pay attention to her body language, tone, and the level of detail she provides. If her explanations seem evasive or unclear, it might be a sign that she's not being entirely truthful.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have doubts and concerns in a relationship. It's better to address them openly and honestly than to sweep them under the rug. Be prepared to have a tough conversation, and be willing to listen to her perspective as well.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that everyone has their own pace and boundaries when it comes to intimacy. It's possible that your girlfriend was just more comfortable with you than with previous partners, but it's also important to consider the possibility that she might be hiding something.\n\nTake your time, gather your thoughts, and have the conversation. It might be challenging, but it's crucial for building trust and understanding in your relationship.",

It's admirable that he's recognizing his own needs and taking steps to address them.\n\nRegarding your concerns about his willingness to be with other women, it's natural to wonder, but it's not necessarily a clear indicator of his commitment to you. People can be capable of having casual relationships or hookups without being emotionally invested in the other person.\n\nHere's a suggestion: take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. What do you want from this relationship? Are you willing to wait for him to work on himself, or do you need more clarity on his commitment to you? It's essential to be honest with yourself about your own needs and boundaries.\n\nConsider having another conversation with him, but this time, focus on your own feelings and needs.
