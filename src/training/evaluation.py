# This is the file that contains offline evaluation function. 
# Not sure how this is going to look yet. 

# Some metrics we may want to consider if "agreeability/sycophancy" and "correction rate"
# Can use normal RLHF metrics like length, toxicity, etc. to ensure the model is not going too far in a bad direction while we try to correct sycophancy
