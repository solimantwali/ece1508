    "sentence": "How can you cope with simultaneously feeling happy about past events while also feeling sad that they are indeed, past events? It's pretty much a nostalgic feeling I believe. When looking back I tend to only focus on the good bits and thereby create a longing inside of me for that time/those kind of times.. I'm fully aware that this is only partially 'true' as the 'bad times' are being ignored and that the longing is purely focused on a distorted, or partial, past. \nYet through it all I'm glad everything happened and has taught me what it has.\n\nSo, in short, how can I be simultaneously happy about all of my past and also allow for the, at times selective, nostalgic longing to return to it?",
    "human": "Perhaps the answer lies in accepting that you're going to feel both happy and sad about the past, at varying degrees and stages of your life.",
    "base_reply": "The bittersweet nature of nostalgia! It's a common phenomenon, and I'm happy to help you navigate it.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that nostalgia is a natural response to the passage of time. It's a way for our brains to process and make sense of our experiences. So, instead of fighting it, let's explore ways to make peace with your nostalgic feelings.\n\nOne approach is to practice acceptance. Recognize that your past experiences, both good and bad, have shaped you into the person you are today. Acknowledge that you've grown and learned from those experiences, and that they've contributed to your current happiness. This acceptance can help you appreciate the present moment while still cherishing the past.\n\nAnother strategy is to cultivate gratitude. When you find yourself lost in nostalgia, take a moment to reflect on the present moment. Make a mental or written list of things you're grateful for in your current life. This can help shift your focus away from longing for the past and towards the good things you have now.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge the impermanence of everything. Nothing stays the same forever, and the past is no exception. While it's natural to romanticize the past, remember that it's not a place you can return to. Instead, focus on the present and the future, and find ways to incorporate the lessons and values from your past into your current life.\n\nFinally, consider the concept of \"nostalgia as a form of love.\" When you're nostalgic for the past, you're essentially showing love and appreciation for the people, experiences, and moments that have shaped you. Instead of trying to suppress these feelings, allow yourself to feel the nostalgia, but also acknowledge that it's okay to move forward.\n\nIn summary, it's not about erasing the nostalgia or suppressing your longing for the past, but rather about finding a balance between appreciating the past, being grateful for the present, and looking forward to the future. By accepting, being grateful, acknowledging impermanence, and viewing nostalgia as a form of love, you can learn to coexist with your bittersweet feelings and find a sense of peace."

(Some examples of these problems are setting up a new credit card, paying our electric bill, and following instructions to make a new food.) If I don't or can't answer her, she'll just ask someone else (usually her mom or another family member) and it never crosses her mind to google it. She has an advanced degree, so it's not like she can't figure things out on her own.\n\nHer dad has told her mom that she gives in to her requests for help too much and should stop for the sake of her own stress levels.

It's also commendable that you're trying to encourage her to develop problem-solving skills and independence.\n\nBefore bringing it up with her, take some time to reflect on your own reactions and emotions. Acknowledge that you've built up resentment in the past, and consider how you can approach this conversation with empathy and understanding.\n\nWhen you do bring it up, try framing it as a concern for her well-being and your relationship, rather than an attack on her abilities. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I've noticed that you often get stuck on simple problems and rely on me or your mom for help. I understand that you're medicated for ADHD, and I want to support you in managing your symptoms. However, I'm worried that this might be affecting your stress levels and our relationship. I think it would be really empowering for you to develop some problem-solving skills and independence. Would you be open to working on this together? Maybe we could start with small tasks and gradually build up your confidence?\"\n\nIt's also essential to listen to her perspective and concerns. She might not be aware of the impact her behavior is having or might feel overwhelmed by the demands of adulting. Be patient, understanding, and avoid being judgmental or critical.\n\nIt's not about being her \"father\" or telling her what she can or can't do. It's about being a supportive partner who wants to help her grow and develop as an individual.\n\nRemember that people can change and grow, but it's a process that requires patience, understanding, and empathy. If she's willing to work on this with you, it could strengthen your relationship and help her develop valuable skills.\n\nAs for whether you should cut your losses, it's ultimately a personal decision. If you feel that this issue is too significant and you're not willing to work on it together, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. However, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns and expectations before making any decisions."

Here are some tips to help you navigate conversations with your coworker:\n\n1. **Slow down**: When someone speaks a non-native language, they might need more time to process and articulate their thoughts. Give your coworker space to think and respond.\n2. **Use visual aids**: If you're discussing a specific topic, consider using diagrams, images, or examples to help illustrate your point. This can be especially helpful if you're having trouble understanding each other.\n3. **Ask clarifying questions**: Instead of saying \"What was that?\", try rephrasing the question to show you're genuinely interested in understanding. For example, \"Can you repeat that in a different way?\" or \"Can you give an example to help me understand?\"\n4. **Use simple language**: Avoid using idioms, colloquialisms, or jargon that might be difficult for your coworker to understand. Stick to straightforward, clear language.\n5. **Be patient and attentive**: Maintain eye contact, nod to show you're engaged, and use nonverbal cues like \"uh-huh\" or \"I see\" to encourage your coworker to continue speaking.\n6. **Offer assistance**: If you're struggling to understand, don't be afraid to ask if your coworker needs help with translation or if they'd prefer to communicate in writing.\n7. **Learn some basic phrases**: Show your coworker that you're making an effort to understand their language by learning basic phrases like \"How are you?\" or \"Thank you.\" This can help build rapport and make conversations more enjoyable.\n\nRemember, effective communication is a two-way street. By being patient, understanding, and willing to adapt, you can improve your interactions with your coworker and build a stronger working relationship.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach the situation now?"

I understand that we may not have the same last name, but I think it's important for our child to have a sense of connection to both of our families.\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that her mom's influence may be playing a role in this.

And on top of that, you're trying to make a career change and provide for your son's future. That's a lot of pressure.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to not be naturally good at something. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. And it's amazing that you're recognizing your struggles and wanting to make a change.\n\nTo become your own drill sergeant, you need to approach this in a way that works for you. Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Break it down into smaller chunks**: Instead of trying to focus on a long period of time, break your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks (20-30 minutes). Take breaks in between to recharge and refocus. This will help you stay motivated and avoid burnout.\n2. **Make a schedule and stick to it**: Plan out your study sessions in advance and stick to it. Treat it like a non-negotiable appointment with yourself. This will help you stay on track and build discipline.\n3. **Find accountability**: Share your goals and schedule with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be a great motivator, especially if you're someone who values social pressure.\n4. **Celebrate small wins**: Don't wait until you've completed a huge task to celebrate. Celebrate small victories along the way. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.\n5. **Find ways to make it enjoyable**: Since you mentioned you're trying to become a webpage developer, find ways to make the process enjoyable. Watch tutorials, join online communities, and work on projects that interest you. This will help you stay engaged and motivated.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to not be perfect. You're not going to become a drill sergeant overnight. Be kind to yourself when you struggle, and don't give up.\n7. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you reach certain milestones. This could be something as simple as a favorite meal, a walk outside, or a fun activity with your son.\n\nRemember, becoming your own drill sergeant is not about being perfect; it's about making progress and taking consistent action towards your goals. You got this!"

This will help your husband understand your perspective and might even lead to a compromise.\n3. **Set boundaries**: If you do decide to attend future outings, set boundaries for yourself. This might mean taking a step back from the group or finding ways to focus on your own interests during the activities.

It's great that you're acknowledging your fears and concerns, which is the first step towards addressing them.\n\nFirstly, let's break down your concerns into manageable chunks. You're not alone in feeling this way; many people, including engineers, experience imposter syndrome. It's a common phenomenon, and it doesn't mean you're not capable or smart. It's more about feeling like you're not good enough or that you're just pretending to be someone you're not.\n\nNow, let's focus on the practical aspects. You've had an incredible background in the army, fixing aircraft, which is an impressive skillset. However, college is a different beast.

It's okay to take your time and adjust to this new environment.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you cope with your anxiety:\n\n1. **Start small**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Focus on one or two tasks at a time, and give yourself realistic deadlines. This will help you build confidence and momentum.\n2. **Seek help**: Talk to your professors, teaching assistants, or classmates about your concerns. They've likely been in your shoes before and can offer valuable advice and guidance.

This could be exercise, reading, or simply taking a walk. It's essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n5. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of focusing on the negative thoughts, try to reframe them in a more positive light. Remind yourself of your strengths and the skills you've developed in the army. You're not just \"playing smart\"; you have a solid foundation to build upon.\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you build confidence and motivation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel scared and unsure, but don't let those feelings hold you back. You've got this! You've overcome challenges before, and you can do it again. Take it one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's normal to struggle, and it doesn't mean you're not cut out for this.

Through the whole ordeal my friend Jessica was by my side, she knew Eric from high school but stopped talking to him years ago, and she started resenting him for how he treated me.\n\nNow that you have the context I'll tell you about the actual situation. The whole thing started on New Year's Eve, we planned a small get together thing at another friend's place (we'll call him Gabe).During the whole night Jessica and Eric were inseparable. Eric and I have this little routine that we always go outside together when he does his cigarette breaks (I'm a non smoker but I enjoy the alone time with him, especially in social situations), so whenever we went outside Jessica came too, nothing weird here because at first I thought that she just enjoyed the company while smoking. And at first I was happy that Eric had someone else to talk to besides me at the party since he only met my other friends maybe once or twice. But the situation started getting weird when the smoke breaks were basically them talking about people I didn't know for 20 minutes straight each time. So after having this occur a few times I stopped tagging along and Eric stopped asking me to. And the last time he did that night when I went outside Jessica was already sitting there with him so as soon as I saw her I went back inside pissed off because whenever I went with them I felt like I was listening in on a two way phone call, they were having conversations I could genuinely not get into because I didn't know the people, the memories or whatever.\n\n(Side note, they were on so many smoking breaks that even Gabe told me a few days after the situation that he had never seen Jessica smoking that much.)\n\nThen besides that during the entire night I always saw them together, even inside, talking, smoking etc. Eric came to check up on me once but I was sitting in Gabe's room, talking to him and shut the door on Eric angrily because I felt like he only came looking for me when she was busy. Jessica's weird attitude didn't stop when everyone was inside together. I was dancing and Eric was looking at me, so she came over to dance seductively with me in front of Eric (she dances in a very specific way when she's enjoying herself vs. when she's trying to get someone's attention and I noticed the 2nd one), and then later I was taking pictures of the entire group and Eric and Jessica were sitting close together again and after a few photos she lifted her dress without a warning so I would take pictures of her ass in undies.\n\nAnd here comes the part in the title, the day after the party, Eric told me that on their last smoke break she had tried to kiss him and that he didn't kiss her back and told her that he was *\"a loyal boyfriend\"* to which I responded in the only way possible, I cut her off, sent her a few texts to give her the opportunity to explain herself (because Eric asked me too, if it wasn't for him I would have insulted and blocked her straight away), to which she only replied that she didn't think that happened, that she didn't remember most of the night, that she was sorry \"if her talking to my boyfriend had made me uncomfortable\" and that she was going through a rough time so \"she didn't have time for the drama\", instead of at least explaining her POV.\n\n***TL;DR My best friend and my boyfriend spent the entire New Year's Eve together and she acted weird during the entire time, and the next day my boyfriend told me that she had tried to kiss him, now I don't know how to feel because he spent the entire night with her having his girlfriend a room away most of the time, and because she is saying that she doesn’t remember and that I'm causing too much drama.***\n\n***My question is, am I doing the right thing by cutting Jessica off?*** \n\n***Was I too quick to believe Eric in his statement?*** \n\n***Am I in the wrong for getting mad at Eric too for enabling her and excluding me?*** \n\n***Should I worry more about what Eric was doing all those hours with her?***",

    "base_reply": "Calculating your hourly wages can be a bit tricky, but I'm here to help you break it down. Since you're based in California, I'll provide you with some general guidance on how to estimate your take-home pay.\n\nTo calculate your hourly wages, you'll need to know your:\n\n1. Gross pay: This is your total earnings before taxes and other deductions.\n2. Hourly rate: This is your base wage rate per hour.\n3. Tax deductions: These include federal, state, and local taxes, as well as any other deductions like health insurance, 401(k) contributions, or union dues.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to help you estimate your take-home pay:\n\n1. Find your gross pay: Check your pay stubs or contact your HR department to get your gross pay figures for a specific pay period (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly).\n2. Calculate your hourly rate: If you know your hourly rate, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can divide your annual salary by the number of hours you work in a year. For a standard full-time schedule, assume 2,080 hours per year (40 hours/week x 52 weeks/year).\n3. Estimate your tax deductions: In California, the state income tax rate ranges from 9.3% to 13.3%. You can use an online tax calculator or consult with a tax professional to estimate your federal and state tax deductions. Other deductions like health insurance, 401(k), or union dues will vary depending on your specific situation.\n4. Calculate your take-home pay: Subtract your estimated tax deductions from your gross pay to get your take-home pay. You can use the following formula:\n\nTake-home pay = Gross pay - (Gross pay x Tax rate)\n\nFor example, let's say your gross pay is $4,000 per bi-weekly pay period, and you estimate a 25% tax rate (federal, state, and other deductions). Your take-home pay would be:\n\nTake-home pay = $4,000 - ($4,000 x 0.25) = $3,000\n\nTo check if your recent checks have been lower than expected, you can compare your take-home pay to your expected take-home pay based on your gross pay and estimated tax deductions. If the difference is significant, it's possible that there's an issue with your pay, such as incorrect deductions or miscalculations.\n\nTo address your concern, I recommend:\n\n1. Review your pay stubs: Verify that your pay stubs accurately reflect your gross pay, deductions, and take-home pay.\n2. Contact your HR department: Reach out to your HR representative to discuss any discrepancies or questions you have about your pay.\n3. Consult with a tax professional: If you're unsure about your tax deductions or have complex tax situations, consider consulting with a tax professional to ensure you're taking advantage of available deductions and credits.\n\nRemember to prioritize open communication with your employer and HR department to resolve any issues and ensure you're receiving accurate and fair compensation."

She might have negative thoughts or experiences with the word fuck. You definitely didn’t do anything wrong but it seems like there’s a piece missing from the puzzle. Try to have a non confrontational conversation about it. Hopefully she can tell you if she’s uncomfortable with anything and move on from this. Good luck!",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a tricky situation! It sounds like you're feeling confused and frustrated.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that your girlfriend's reaction was valid, even if you didn't intend to make her uncomfortable. When someone is being objectified or sexualized, it can be triggering and make them feel disrespected.\n\nIt's possible that your girlfriend was initially enjoying the playful, flirtatious atmosphere, but when you made the comment, she felt like you crossed a boundary. The fact that she was wearing lingerie and twerking doesn't necessarily mean she was consenting to sex or sexual advances.\n\nIn hindsight, it's great that you asked if she was being serious when she called you a pervert. This shows that you're willing to listen and consider her perspective. However, it's also important to recognize that your comment was still inappropriate, even if you didn't mean to be offensive.\n\nGoing forward, it's essential to prioritize open and respectful communication with your girlfriend. You might want to have a conversation with her about what she's comfortable with and what boundaries you both need to respect. It's also crucial to understand that just because someone is dressed or behaving in a certain way doesn't mean they're automatically open to sexual advances.\n\nRemember, consent is an ongoing process, and it's essential to prioritize your partner's feelings and boundaries. Take this as an opportunity to learn and grow, and work on building a more respectful and open relationship.\n\nWhat do you think you'll do next?"

Long story short, my little brother who is 19, freshman in college, does nothing but play video games and go to school. \nHe lives at home with my mother who is fucking amazing, but she cannot say no; so whatever new video game he wants, he gets. He has his own big screen, Xbone, PS4, Laptop and Desktop PC that my mother has all purchased for him. \n\nHe has no friends outside of digital ones. Doesn't have his license, so he cannot drive, my mother drives him to COLLEGE. \n\nMy mother doesn't share my concerns because she says that he's going to school.

    "base_reply": "I totally get your concerns, and it's great that you're thinking about your brother's future. It's understandable that you're worried about his lack of motivation and the potential consequences of his current habits.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you can't force your brother to change, but you can certainly have an open and honest conversation with him. I'd suggest having a calm and non-accusatory talk with him about your concerns. Avoid blaming or criticizing his habits, as this might lead to defensiveness. Instead, focus on expressing your worries about his future and the importance of developing skills and experiences outside of gaming.\n\nHere are some specific suggestions:\n\n1. **Encourage his interests**: While your brother enjoys gaming, there might be other aspects of gaming that interest him, such as game development, esports, or streaming. Explore these areas with him and see if there are opportunities for him to develop skills or even start a small business.\n2. **Job shadowing or volunteering**: Suggest that your brother job shadow or volunteer at a company or organization that aligns with his interests. This can help him gain work experience, build connections, and develop skills.\n3. **Set small, achievable goals**: Encourage your brother to set specific, achievable goals for himself, such as completing a certain number of job applications or attending a certain number of networking events. Celebrate his progress and accomplishments along the way.\n4. **Encourage accountability**: Suggest that your brother find an accountability partner, such as a friend or mentor, who can check in with him regularly to discuss his goals and progress.\n5. **Gradual changes**: Rather than trying to make drastic changes, suggest small, incremental changes, such as setting aside specific times for gaming or limiting the number of hours spent playing.\n6. **Your mother's involvement**: While it's great that your mother is supportive, it's essential to have a conversation with her about her role in enabling your brother's gaming habits. Encourage her to set boundaries and encourage your brother to take responsibility for his own life.\n7. **Seek professional help**: If your brother is struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, it may be helpful to seek professional help. A therapist can work with him to identify underlying issues and develop strategies for overcoming them.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Avoid being confrontational or judgmental, as this might lead to resistance. By having an open and honest conversation, you can help your brother see the importance of developing skills and experiences outside of gaming.\n\nLastly, consider having a plan in place for when your brother does move out and start his own life. This might include setting boundaries, establishing routines, and encouraging him to take responsibility for his own life. By having a plan, you can help him transition smoothly and avoid potential pitfalls."

    "human": "You will feel a lot more free when you realise that people are extremely self absorbed and all the people who you are worrying about are just thinking about themselves. It's refreshing to accept that no one gives a shit, so focus on the positive relationships with your friends and the people who do care about you.",
    "base_reply": "Self-consciousness can be a real challenge! I'm happy to help.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really \"deal\" with self-consciousness; I'm just programmed to be a helpful AI. But I can offer some tips that might help you manage yours.\n\n1. **Self-compassion is key**: Treat yourself with kindness, just as you would a close friend. Practice mindfulness and acknowledge that it's normal to feel self-conscious sometimes. Remind yourself that everyone feels this way, and it doesn't define your worth.\n2. **Focus on the present moment**: When you start to feel self-conscious, gently bring your attention to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, or the task at hand. This can help you detach from self-judgment and worries about the past or future.\n3. **Practice self-reflection (not self-criticism)**: Regularly take time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Identify areas where you'd like to improve, but do so in a non-judgmental way. Celebrate your strengths and acknowledge your weaknesses.\n4. **Challenge negative self-talk**: When self-doubt creeps in, challenge those negative thoughts by reframing them in a more balanced and realistic light. For example, instead of \"I'm so stupid for making that mistake,\" try \"I made a mistake, but I can learn from it and grow.\"\n5. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you. Avoid those who bring you down or make you feel bad about yourself.\n6. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional needs. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing, and prioritize getting enough sleep.\n7. **Reframe your self-consciousness**: Instead of viewing self-consciousness as a weakness, try to see it as an opportunity to grow and improve. Recognize that it's a natural part of the learning process, and that it can help you develop greater self-awareness and empathy for others.\n\nRemember, self-consciousness is not a fixed trait – it's a dynamic and changing aspect of human experience. By working with it, rather than trying to overcome it, you can learn to manage your self-consciousness and cultivate a more positive, compassionate relationship with yourself.\n\nHow do you think you might apply these tips to your own life?"

However, I want to encourage you to take a step back and re-evaluate your approach. Giving your husband an ultimatum and creating distance between you two might not be the most effective or healthy way to address your concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your husband has reassured you multiple times that there's nothing romantic or inappropriate going on between him and this woman. You've also mentioned that you trust him, which is crucial in a relationship. It's possible that his friendship with this woman is genuine and platonic.\n\nThat being said, I understand why you might feel uneasy about her constant presence in your life and the way she makes you feel. It's essential to communicate your concerns to your husband in a non-accusatory and respectful manner. Instead of giving him an ultimatum, try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling.\n\nYou could start by expressing your feelings and concerns to your husband, using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, you could say:\n\n\"I feel uncomfortable when [her name] is around because I feel like she's trying to replace me in your life. I know you've reassured me that there's nothing romantic going on, but I still feel uneasy. Can we find ways to make me feel more included and important in our relationship?\"\n\nIt's also crucial to address your concerns about her constant presence in your life. You could suggest setting boundaries or limits on how often she reaches out to your husband or how often they spend time together. It's essential to find a compromise that works for both you and your husband.\n\nRegarding your concerns about her being single, it's possible that she's not prioritizing relationships or is focusing on her career. It's not uncommon for people to prioritize their professional goals over personal relationships. However, it's essential to remember that her personal choices are her own, and it's not your responsibility to fix her life or worry about her relationships.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to focus on nurturing your relationship with your husband and building a stronger connection with him. Instead of trying to eliminate this woman from your life, try to focus on what you can control – your own feelings and actions. Work on building trust and communication with your husband, and try to find ways to make your relationship more fulfilling and satisfying for you.\n\nRemember, relationships take work and compromise. It's essential to find a balance between your needs and desires and those of your partner. I hope this helps, and I'm here to support you in any way I can."

I usually keep my wallet in my front pocket, but not in the most traditional sense. I have a small, slim wallet that can fit in my breast pocket, which is surprisingly spacious. It's a great spot because it's easy to access and doesn't put pressure on my lower back.\n\nFor my keys, I have a keychain with a small clip that attaches to my belt loop or my bag's belt. It's a simple and convenient way to keep them secure and within reach.\n\nAs for my phone, I usually carry it in a phone case with a built-in card slot, which can hold my credit cards and ID. This way, I don't need to carry a separate wallet or pouch. The phone case also provides some protection for my phone, which is a bonus!\n\nOf course, everyone's body is different, so it's essential to experiment and find what works best for you. You might consider trying a fanny pack or a small backpack for carrying your essentials, especially if you have limited front pocket space. Just make sure to choose a comfortable and breathable material to avoid adding to your back issues.\n\nRemember to prioritize your comfort and take regular breaks to stretch and move around.

It's a natural response! But it's also important to recognize when that excitement starts to cloud your judgment. Here are a few strategies that might help you cultivate a more objective outlook:\n\n1. **Take a step back and breathe**: When you start to feel that excitement and attachment, pause for a moment. Take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that this is just the beginning of getting to know someone. It's okay to feel enthusiastic, but don't let that enthusiasm dictate your decision-making.\n2. **Focus on shared values and goals**: Instead of getting caught up in physical attraction or surface-level compatibility, try to focus on what matters most to you in a partner. What are your values, interests, and goals? Are they aligned with the person you're interested in? Ask yourself questions like these to get a better sense of whether this person is a good match for you in the long run.\n3. **Practice self-reflection**: Take some time to reflect on your past experiences, including the one that ended in embarrassment. What did you learn from it? What would you do differently if you found yourself in a similar situation again? Self-awareness is key to making better decisions.\n4. **Surround yourself with people who support you**: Having a strong support system can help you stay grounded and make better choices. Surround yourself with people who encourage you to be honest with yourself and prioritize your own well-being.\n5. **Develop a growth mindset**: Recognize that relationships are a process of growth and learning. Instead of focusing on the end goal (i.e., getting into a relationship), focus on the journey itself. What are you learning about yourself and others through this experience?\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in fantasies or worries about the future. Try incorporating mindfulness exercises into your daily routine to improve your self-awareness and emotional regulation.\n7. **Give yourself permission to say no**: Remember that it's okay to say no to someone who's not a good match for you. You don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your decision. Trust your instincts and prioritize your own needs.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop a more objective perspective.

Is that something you're comfortable with?\"\n6. **Re-evaluate the relationship**: If you've tried the above suggestions and her cancellations continue, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship. Ask yourself if you're comfortable with the uncertainty and lack of commitment. If not, it might be better to move on and focus on someone who is more reliable and communicative.\n\nRemember, you deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to make your relationship work.

Healthy young kids, financial stability, we have fun together, including a good sex life. I seem to care about/crave sex more but I don't think that's too unusual as the man. \n\nI am considering suggesting to my wife that we open up our marriage \\*for same-sex encounters only\\*. I'm posting here looking for advice. Is it just a really dumb idea that I will regret? Have any of you done this and how has it worked out for you?\n\nI've only been with women. There have been times in my life I've thought about a gay hookup but never acted on it. Somewhat recently, wife and I were talking about sex and I shared that I used to masturbate on occasion with a dildo (that I had discarded years ago). She didn't seem to think much of it, she knows I enjoy assplay and occasionally watch gay porn. After that conversation, I ordered a new dildo and have used it a few times recently. And now I'm wondering about gay sex. \n\nPrior to our relationship, my wife has had a few threesomes (f/f/m) and lesbian encounters. She's overall more sexually experienced than me. I think this is relevant, she seems to be a lot less sexually &amp; emotionally jealous/anxious than me. \n\nIf she were to hook up with a woman randomly, I would be in favor of it. We've had conversations in which this is implied but it has never been a clear and direct communication. Mostly because I don't think she's interested in it. Seems to me her view is she's experimented, she's had her fun, it wasn't a big deal for her.\n\nI'm interested in what it's like to have sex with another man. The standard I have in mind here (she also can do whatever she wants with women) would be the fair one, in my mind. If her perspective is, \"well we either have an open marriage or a monogamous one\", I would concede I can understand that perspective and would prefer we remain monogamous. I'm bisexual, not solely gay. I will be perfectly happy to continue having sex with my wife for the rest of our lives. \n\nI am very much not interested in her sleeping with/dating other men. And I'm not looking for another woman, nobody could rival the match she is for me. We have discussed threesomes, mostly as fantasies. I'm somewhat open to the idea of a threesome, either with a man or a woman, but I have a lot of anxiety about a threesome with another man. Our sexual dynamic is very much that I am the dominant one. I once read a post on here about a m/m/f threesome where the female basically could not \"unsee\" her male partner in the submissive position after that experience. I'm worried this kind of thing could damage the great sex life we currently have. I have a similar concern about pegging, but I'm open to it. \n\nSo, what say you reddit. Am I crazy for thinking about proposing this? What have I not thought through? If you have been in a similar situation, how did it go?Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment, it was helpful to read other peoples' perspectives. Now I'm thinking I should talk to my wife about how I would like to try more assplay (of me) with her, potentially including pegging, and see what she thinks of it. I see that's a better path forward, to satisfy my desires with her.",
    "human": "I think the main roadblock you're gonna have here is that your restrictions only really play into your current interests and not hers.\n\nIt sounds like her lesbian encounters are not a thing she is currently into. So what's the fucking point of just opening your relationship up for a thing just you are interested in?\n\nYou are ACTIVELY interested in seeking out another man to have sex with. Like literally the minute she gives the green light, you're gonna vanish in a puff of cartoon smoke in the shape of your body to go make that happen.\n\nShe probably has no desire to get out there. And even if she did, the chance that she'd want it to just be with another woman is incredibly low. So while you're out there enacting your long gestating master plan. She's going to just be in a daze wondering what the fuck just happened. This will not be a journey you go on together. You're also further restricting things by implying that it will be a \"random\" hookup. So she's not allowed to get a girlfriend, either.\n\nAnyway, I get that this is complicated and there's a reason why longterm monogamous relationships that suddenly go open based on the desires from one party explode hilariously. But you're coming at this from an extraordinarily selfish angle while fooling yourself into thinking you're also giving her a perk as well. This is like the sex equivalent of giving someone a vacuum cleaner as a birthday gift.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've given me a lot to process! I'm happy to help you explore your thoughts and concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're considering your wife's feelings and perspectives. It's essential to prioritize open communication and mutual understanding in any relationship.\n\nRegarding your idea of proposing an open marriage for same-sex encounters, I have some concerns. While it's understandable that you're curious about exploring your bisexuality, it's crucial to consider the potential impact on your marriage and your wife's feelings. It's not just about satisfying your desires, but also about maintaining a strong and healthy relationship.\n\nHere are a few potential red flags:\n\n1. **Unbalanced power dynamics**: Your dominant-submissive dynamic in your sexual encounters might not translate well to a same-sex encounter, especially if you're seeking a more submissive role. This could create tension and conflict within your relationship.\n2. **Emotional complexity**: Exploring same-sex encounters might bring up complex emotions and insecurities, particularly if you're not prepared to navigate these feelings with your wife. This could lead to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and potentially damage your relationship.\n3. **Communication and boundaries**: You mentioned your wife might not be interested in same-sex encounters, and you're worried about her sleeping with or dating other men. It's essential to have a clear and open conversation about boundaries, expectations, and desires to avoid misunderstandings.\n4. **Prioritizing your desires over your wife's feelings**: While it's natural to have desires and needs, it's crucial to consider your wife's feelings and comfort level. You might need to prioritize her needs and boundaries over your own desires, at least initially.\n\nConsidering your concerns and the potential risks, I would recommend taking a different approach. Instead of proposing an open marriage, you could:\n\n1. **Explore your desires with your wife**: Have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your desires and fantasies, including same-sex encounters. Be prepared to listen to her thoughts, feelings, and boundaries.\n2. **Focus on satisfying your desires within your marriage**: Consider exploring other ways to satisfy your desires, such as experimenting with pegging or incorporating more assplay into your sex life with your wife.\n3. **Prioritize communication and intimacy**: Focus on maintaining a strong emotional connection and intimacy with your wife. This can help you build trust and understanding, making it easier to navigate any future discussions about desires and boundaries.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise, communication, and mutual understanding. It's essential to prioritize your wife's feelings and desires, while also being honest about your own needs and desires.\n\nI hope this helps you reconsider your approach and find a more balanced and fulfilling path forward."

    "human": "I forget where I read it, but something I read said that you must be absolutely unequivocal in your statements.  No \"let's take some time apart\" or anything like that.

Avoid getting into a prolonged conversation or debate about the breakup.\n7. **Offer support**: Let the other person know that you're there for them, even if it's just as a friend. Offer support and resources if they need help dealing with the aftermath.\n\nExample script to help you get started:\n\n\"[Name], I wanted to talk to you about us.

I hope you can understand where I'm coming from. If you need to talk or need any support, I'm here for you.\"\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this conversation. It's okay to take a moment to collect your thoughts and emotions before the conversation.

On one hand, you feel betrayed by your mom's infidelity, and on the other hand, you're struggling to reconcile that with the fact that she's still your mom and you love her.\n\nHere's what I want you to consider: your mom's sexuality doesn't define her as a person or a parent. Her relationships and choices are hers to make, and it's not your responsibility to judge or condemn her for them. It's essential to separate your feelings about her sexuality from your feelings about her as a parent.\n\nAs for your brother's perspective, it's valid that he's saying her sexuality has nothing to do with you both. Children should be loved and accepted regardless of their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your mom's decision to come out and be in a relationship with Carrie might be a significant change for you, and it's okay to take time to process that.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your feelings. Be honest about how you're feeling, but also try to separate your feelings from judgments. Let her know that you love her and value your relationship with her, but you need time to process this new information. It's possible that she'll appreciate your honesty and willingness to have a conversation.\n\nLastly, remember that you don't have to resolve this situation immediately. Take your time, and focus on self-care. Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist about your feelings, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many people have gone through similar situations, and there are resources available to help you navigate this challenging time."

It was clear this guy was a lot on her mind. She had sexual dreams about him. She wrote she loved him, though not in a romantic way. She wrote things she didn't like about me. She wrote about how much she was bothered by his new girlfriend. I also found a letter she had written to him - I found it when she asked me go through her stuff in order to find some document for her. It was a letter I don't think she ever actually sent to him, but it was clear she was very fond of him and how he taught her to to be intimate lovingly. It was kind of a goodbye-letter. \n\nShe stil sees him on regular basis. Yesterday I found out he had been in her place on Friday night. I was at her place and in the fridge she had a package of meat which was half-empty. She's a vegetarian so I asked why she had meat in her fridge. \"Because it was for somebody else. \\*ex's name\\* was here yesterday\". It made me furious to find out she had not mentioned this to me - she knows I don't like her hanging out with exes - especially this one - but we had agreed that she would tell me upfront if she was going to see him, that she would be open and honest about it and not seeing him behind my back. I have a really hard time believing she \"forgot\" to mention it - sure, she could have wanted to avoid another \"bad moment\" with me but at this point I can't help but thinking that there is way more going on. \n\nShe does not know I read all this stuff, and even though it was a shitty thing to do, I'd rather know when someone is trying to fool me. \n\ntl;dr: my gf keeps seeing an ex on regular basis and I don't trust it",

You've been hurt and disrespected by her actions, and it's natural to want to protect yourself from further pain.\n\nBefore you decide what to do next, take some time to reflect on your feelings and what you're willing to tolerate in this relationship. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you willing to continue in a relationship where your partner is not being honest with you, especially about significant aspects of their life?\n2. Are you comfortable with the fact that she's still in contact with her ex, and possibly even having intimate thoughts about him?\n3. Have you discussed your boundaries and concerns with her, and are you willing to continue having these conversations and working through them together?\n\nConsider having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns. Be specific about what you've learned and how it's made you feel. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing language.\n\nIt's also crucial to evaluate whether you're willing to work through these issues together or if you've reached a point where you need to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it's sustainable for you.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, trusted, and valued.

It's normal to feel a pang of nostalgia for the carefree days of university life, but it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and seeking advice.\n\nFirstly, recognize that it's okay to feel this way. It's natural to miss the excitement and freedom of your younger years, but it's also important to focus on the positive aspects of your current situation. You've achieved financial independence, you're in a stable relationship, and you're building a life with your partner.\n\nTo deal with these feelings, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1.

Acknowledge the nostalgia and the sense of loss, but also remind yourself of the benefits of your current situation.\n2. Find new social connections: Since you don't have friends in your partner's hometown, make an effort to meet new people. Join a club or group that aligns with your interests, take a class, or attend events in your community. This will help you expand your social circle and meet new people.\n3. Nurture your current relationships: While you may not have as many friends as you did in college, focus on nurturing the relationships you do have. Schedule regular check-ins with your partner's friends and make an effort to stay in touch with your college friends. You can also plan virtual hangouts or visits to stay connected.\n4. Create new experiences: Since you're feeling a sense of loss for the excitement of university life, try to create new experiences that bring you joy. Take up a new hobby, travel, or try something you've always wanted to do. This will help you feel more fulfilled and excited about your current life.\n5. Practice self-reflection: Take time to reflect on why you're feeling this way. Are you feeling trapped or stuck in your current situation? Are there any specific aspects of your life that you're unhappy with? Identifying the root cause of your feelings can help you address them more effectively.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and adjust to your new life.

    "base_reply": "It's frustrating when services don't meet expectations, and it's even more disappointing when they don't take responsibility or offer adequate compensation.\n\nFirstly, let's break down what happened in your situation. You waited an hour for your food, which is already unacceptable, and then received an incorrect order. You complained and got it changed, which is good, but the manager's apology and lack of further compensation was underwhelming.\n\nIn contrast, your friend's approach was more assertive, and he got a better outcome. This doesn't mean you should be aggressive like him, but it does suggest that being more direct and specific about your concerns can sometimes get better results.\n\nWhen complaining, it's essential to:\n\n1. Stay calm and composed: Take a few deep breaths, and try not to let your emotions get the better of you.\n2. Be specific: Clearly state what went wrong, e.g., \"I ordered [food] and waited [time] for it to arrive, but it took [much longer] and was incorrect.\"\n3. Avoid being accusatory: Instead of saying \"you forgot my order,\" say \"it seems there was an issue with my order, and I'd like it corrected.\"\n4.

You could say, \"I understand you're busy, but I'd appreciate it if you could correct the issue and offer some compensation.\"\n5.

Escalate if necessary: If the issue isn't resolved, ask to speak with a supervisor or someone who can help.\n4. Consider social media: If you're not getting a satisfactory response, try reaching out to the company's social media team. They may be more willing to listen and help.\n5. Look for alternative providers: If you're consistently having issues with a particular company, it might be time to explore other options.\n\nRemember, complaining effectively is about being assertive, specific, and open to solutions.

You can also use a gentle hand gesture, like placing your hand on the table or tapping your fingers on the armrest, to signal you're about to contribute to the conversation.\n3. **Practice assertive speaking**: When you do finally get a chance to speak, try to speak clearly and confidently. Avoid apologetic phrases like \"I'm sorry to interrupt\" or \"I don't mean to interrupt,\" as these can make you sound hesitant or unsure. Instead, start your sentence with a clear and direct statement, like \"I think...\" or \"I've noticed...\"\n4. **Set boundaries**: If you find that certain individuals consistently dominate the conversation, it may be necessary to set some boundaries. You can politely tell them that you'd like to share your thoughts and opinions, and ask if they can let you finish speaking before jumping in again.\n5. **Change the topic or setting**: If the dynamic is consistently toxic or unproductive, it might be time to shift the conversation or seek out a different group of people to talk to. Your time and energy are valuable, and you deserve to be heard and respected in your conversations.\n\nRemember, effective communication is a two-way street. It's not just about getting your point across, but also about being open to listening and engaging with others. By being mindful of your communication style and setting boundaries, you can create a more balanced and respectful conversation dynamic."

I feel very frustrated and start to get mean and say not so much unpleasent thing, but more like inconvenient. I'm beggining to lose faith in me, and I just think that I am a complete idiot that never says anything rigth\n\nIs there a way for me to control these emotions, a \"rule\" or a procedure ?",

    "base_reply": "I totally understand your struggle! It's frustrating when we feel like we're not being heard or respected, and it's natural to feel like we're not doing something right.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's not about being an idiot or never saying anything right. It's normal to have disagreements and misunderstandings, and it's not a reflection of your intelligence or worth.\n\nTo help you keep calm and composed during discussions, I'd like to share some strategies that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Pause and take a deep breath**: When you start to feel yourself getting agitated, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. This simple act can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.\n2. **Acknowledge and validate**: Instead of getting defensive, try acknowledging the other person's perspective and validating their feelings. This can help diffuse tension and create a more constructive atmosphere. For example, you could say, \"I understand why you feel that way\" or \"I can see why you'd think that.\"\n3. **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Try to separate the issue from the person. Avoid personal attacks or criticisms, and focus on the topic at hand. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings, rather than \"you\" statements that can come across as accusatory.\n4. **Practice active listening**: Make an effort to truly listen to the other person, without interrupting or planning your response. Repeat back what you've heard to ensure you understand their perspective, and ask clarifying questions to show you're engaged.\n5. **Set boundaries**: If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed or frustrated, it's okay to take a break or step away from the conversation. You can say, \"I need a moment to collect my thoughts\" or \"Can we table this discussion for now?\"\n6. **Reframe your thinking**: When you start to feel like you're not being heard or respected, try reframing your thoughts. Instead of thinking, \"They're not listening to me,\" try thinking, \"I'm not being heard because I'm not communicating effectively\" or \"I need to find a better way to express myself.\"\n7. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you develop greater self-awareness and emotional regulation. This can make it easier to stay calm and composed during stressful conversations.\n\nAs for a \"rule\" or procedure, I'd suggest the following:\n\n**The 3-Step Approach**:\n\n1. **Listen**: Listen actively and attentively to the other person's perspective.\n2. **Acknowledge**: Acknowledge and validate their feelings and concerns.\n3. **Respond**: Respond thoughtfully and constructively, focusing on the issue at hand.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits and improve your communication skills. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you don't get it right. With time and effort, you can become more confident and effective in your communication."

He's the first man I've had feelings for or been in a serious relationship with which could be relevant. We were friends first and my family LOVED him. They actually invited him for Christmas when we were friends so I know this isn't about anything other than disapproving of our relationship. \n\nChristmas is a big deal in my family, the whole extended family is there including partners. I automatically assumed my partner would be there. My family were awkward about our relationship at first but I really thought they were coming around. However, my mum (who always hosts) has told me he isn't invited because older relatives wouldn't be comfortable and it might ruin the day.

Any time my friends or family have had an issue with us being together, he's just ended up feeling bad because he feels like he's causing problems in my relationships.

I think this situation is going to make him feel even worse. \n\nI don't know what the best way is to handle it.

He might feel guilty or like he's being forced to spend the holiday away from your family, which could lead to more emotional distress.\n\nTo make the conversation easier, you could propose an alternative celebration with just the two of you, like a quiet dinner or a weekend getaway. This way, you can still spend time together and create a special memory, without feeling guilty or pressured.\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your relationship and your own happiness in this situation.

You deserve to get the help you need to feel better.\n\nIt might be helpful to have a conversation with your parents about how their words are making you feel. You can explain to them that you didn't do anything wrong and that you're seeking help because you need it. It's possible they didn't understand the severity of the situation, and a calm conversation can help clear the air.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep reaching out for help, and don't give up. You got this, and you're strong enough to get through this."

    "sentence": "how to get certificate ink off wallet sleeve My husband accidentally washed his wallet. In it was a card-sized certificate that he absolutely needs for work. It's not allowed to be laminated and it physically needs to be on him legally. We took all the cards out of the plastic wallet sleeves, and the ink of that certificate is stuck to the wallet sleeve. So all of the pertinent information (his name, the certificate number) aren't on the certificate. And the issuing agency was VERY adamant that they will not reissue these cards under any circumstances. What the hell do we do?",
    "human": "I really think they should reissue the card. If there's a security concern because for all they know the original card might have been stolen or given to somebody else, then all they need to do is change his code / credentials so that the new card is technically a new employee, and the old one's signature is just invalid.\n\nBut since that is out of the question, maybe you could do something with heat. With an iron, perhaps. I would try to put the card exactly where it was and hope the heat would transfer the ink back, slowly and steadily. Just do yourself a favor and have a fire extinguisher at hand for the worst case scenario. This tip is in no way verified or tried and proven. It's a hypothesis — it *might* work. Definitely not a *pro* tip.",
    "base_reply": "What a frustrating situation! Losing essential information can be stressful, especially when it's related to work. Since the certificate can't be laminated and it's crucial for your husband's job, we need to find a solution to remove the ink from the wallet sleeve. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you salvage the certificate:\n\n1. **Act quickly**: The sooner you start working on this, the better. Ink can set over time, making it more challenging to remove.\n2. **Gently try to loosen the ink**: Use a credit card or a similar tool to carefully slide between the wallet sleeve and the certificate. You're trying to create a gap to work with. Be patient and gentle, as excessive force can damage the wallet or the certificate.\n3. **Apply a solvent**: Dampen a cloth with a mild solvent like white vinegar, hairspray, or a gentle cleaning solution (avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive substances). Gently rub the solvent onto the affected area, focusing on the ink. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the solvent to penetrate.\n4. **Use a gentle heat**: Apply a warm, damp cloth to the area. The heat can help loosen the ink, making it easier to remove. Be cautious not to apply too much heat, as it can damage the certificate or wallet.\n5. **Blot, don't rub**: Use a clean, damp cloth to blot the area, focusing on soaking up the ink and solvent. Avoid rubbing, as this can push the ink deeper into the wallet sleeve.\n6. **Repeat if necessary**: If some ink remains, repeat the process until you've removed as much of the ink as possible.\n7. **Dry the area**: Use a dry cloth to blot the area and remove any excess moisture.\n8. **Inspect and clean**: Examine the certificate to see if the ink has been removed. If some residue remains, you can try using a gentle cleaning solution or a lint-free cloth to remove any remaining ink.\n\nIt's essential to act carefully and patiently, as excessive force or harsh chemicals can damage the certificate or wallet. If you're not comfortable attempting to remove the ink yourself, consider taking the wallet and certificate to a professional document restoration service or a reputable dry cleaner.\n\nAs for the issuing agency's stance on not reissuing the certificate, it's crucial to understand their policy and potential consequences. You may want to explain the situation to them and see if there's any room for flexibility or an exception. It's also essential to keep a record of your attempts to remove the ink and any communication with the agency.\n\nRemember to prioritize your husband's work requirements and the importance of having the certificate. If you're unable to remove the ink, it may be necessary to explore alternative solutions, such as obtaining a new certificate or seeking guidance from his employer or a relevant authority."

The only issue in our relationship was marriage and kids. I had just watched my parents go through a brutal divorce and had more than a little fear of commitment. \n\nJulie wanted to get married, I didn’t. She wanted kids, I didn’t. So we broke up. \n\nAt first it was fun. I hadn’t been single in 6 years and the whole dating app thing was novel and exciting. I worked a lot, went on a lot of dates, had a lot of sex. When I finally came up for air about 8 months later and realized none of it made me as happy as Julie, it was too late. She was in a relationship and living two hours away. \n\nI went through a pretty serious depressive episode and ended up going to therapy. Through that process, I realized that I *did* want to marry Julie, I *did* want to have a family with her, but I had been fairly traumatized from watching my parents fight over every last dollar and turn the whole family against one another. I realized how rare it is to find your best friend and your lover in one person, and the fact that I let her go was something I’m pretty sure I’ll never get over. \n\nFast forward 5 years. I’m 35 now. I’ve had a few relationships but they didn’t last, and I never stopped thinking about Julie or regretting how things ended. Then, about a month ago, I sit down at the bar in my town to get a drink after work with some coworkers, I look over, and Julie is bartending. \n\nAfter some initial awkwardness, we get to talking. She’s single now, she moved back here about a year ago, and she’s been living only a few blocks over from me. I got her number and we’ve been texting a lot. It’s crazy how it feels like we’re picking up right where we left off, but I can tell she’s reluctant to get too involved again. \n\nWhen we were together I used to write her love letters or notes (cheesy I know) and sneak them into her bag so she’d find them later. I invited her to a party at my sister’s house on Friday and I want to give her another letter then. \n\nIs it too much to tell her I am still in love with her and I want to be with her? That I want marriage and a family with her? It’s been 5 years. It’s why we broke up, so she needs to know, but it feels like I’m dumping all this shit on her when I don’t even know if she’d be open to giving our relationship another try? On the other hand, I’ll never forgive myself if I don’t take this second chance. She is literally my dream girl and my best friend. I’ve never felt this connected to another person and I doubt I ever will again. \n\nTL/DR- I broke up with my long term girlfriend because she wanted marriage/family and she didn’t. Got therapy. Realized she is exactly what I wanted but it was too late. Now I have a second chance and don’t want to blow it.",

She may have resentments, reservations and fears around getting on the same merry-go-round and getting hurt again. Give her space to talk about that and hear her out. Honor her feelings and express your own.\n\nThen *and only then* should you tell her that you'd like to formally court her (date her very intentionally for a long term relationship, cohabitation and eventually marriage).",

It's clear that you've done a lot of self-reflection and growth since the breakup, and it's admirable that you're taking the time to consider Julie's feelings and boundaries.\n\nBefore you give her the letter, I want to caution you to consider the timing and approach. You mention she's been hesitant to get involved again, and it's possible that she's not ready or willing to rekindle things. It's essential to respect her boundaries and give her space to process her own feelings.\n\nInstead of dumping all your emotions and desires on her at once, I suggest taking a more subtle approach. You could start by having a conversation with her about your feelings, without being too pushy or aggressive. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us and how I'm feeling. I've been thinking a lot about our past and how much I miss having you in my life. I've done some work on myself and realized that I was afraid of commitment due to my parents' divorce. But I've come to realize that I do want to get married and have a family with someone like you. I know it's a lot to take in, but I wanted to be honest with you and see if there's any chance we could rekindle things. I value our friendship and connection, and I don't want to lose that.\"\n\nBy taking a more gradual and gentle approach, you'll be more likely to get a genuine response from Julie and avoid overwhelming her. Remember that she may not be ready to rekindle things, and that's okay. It's essential to respect her decision and prioritize her feelings.\n\nAlso, consider this: even if Julie isn't interested in rekindling things, having an open and honest conversation with her can still be a positive step forward for you. You'll have closure, and you'll know that you've done everything you can to express your feelings and desires.\n\nRemember to prioritize self-care and patience during this process. It's okay to take your time and not rush into anything. Good luck, and I hope you find the outcome that's best for you both."

Here's the thing: gratitude isn't always a natural feeling, and it's okay to acknowledge those negative thoughts and emotions. In fact, suppressing them can make things worse.\n\nInstead, let's focus on cultivating a mindset that acknowledges and works with those feelings. Here are some tips to help you cultivate gratitude, even on tough days:\n\n1. **Acknowledge your emotions**: Recognize that it's normal to feel negative emotions, and give yourself permission to feel them. Don't try to suppress or deny them.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to not be perfect.\n3. **Identify the good stuff**: When you're feeling down, it can be hard to see the positive. Try to find one small thing each day that you're grateful for. It could be something as simple as a good cup of coffee, a beautiful sunset, or a kind word from a friend.\n4. **Keep a gratitude journal**: Writing down things you're grateful for can help shift your focus away from negative thoughts. Try to write down three things each day, no matter how small they may seem.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries about the past or future. Try taking a few deep breaths, noticing your senses, or doing a quick meditation.\n6. **Reach out to others**: Connecting with loved ones, friends, or a therapist can help you feel heard, validated, and supported. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.\n7. **Practice gratitude in daily activities**: Incorporate gratitude into your daily routine, like during meals, walks, or while showering. Try saying out loud what you're grateful for, or simply acknowledging it to yourself.\n8. **Focus on the present**: Try to stay present in the moment, rather than dwelling on past regrets or worrying about the future. This can help you appreciate the small joys and blessings in your life.\n\nRemember, gratitude isn't always a feeling, but a practice. It's okay to start small and work your way up. Don't expect to feel grateful all the time, but instead, focus on cultivating a mindset that acknowledges and appreciates the good things in your life.\n\nHope these tips help, my friend!"

We have been together for about 3.5 years and for 2.5 before we moved.\n\nWell now that we have lived in this new area near his family for about a year I want to leave him and go back home. \n\nBefore we moved we didn’t live together but spent a good majority of our time together and knew about most of each other’s weird habits so that’s not really the issue. The issue is that I have spent so much time, money, and energy on helping him and his family and I’m not getting anything in return. \n\nI know that sounds pretty greedy and cynical but I don’t mean it that way. The deal with us moving here is that we would help his elderly grandparents so that their family business wouldn’t have to close and they would have less of a chance of losing everything. Well that has turned into me working 7 days a week all summer between helping them and working my other job on weekends so that I still have it when winter comes around (we live in a tourist dominated area, so the summer is always busy no matter what)\n\nI don’t mind working so much but it’s the way I’m being treated while doing all this work. My boyfriends grandparents are very protective over their business, which is understandable since they’ve had it since they got married, but that means they won’t leave me alone when I’m working for them and hover around to judge every single thing I do, all while I am taking on the whole workload other than the deeper financial stuff, and only getting paid $10/hour. \n\nI admit that there have been a few times where I slip up on things, but I feel like their reactions are just over the top. They have screamed at me, and my BF stood by and said nothing to stop them, so I started talking back. I don’t let people talk to me like that no matter if they’re my age or 90, but it has made the relationship even worse and now the grandfather has fired me and said he’s never speaking to me again because I’m so rude. \n\nI’m also in a place in my relationship with my boyfriend where I see his priorities and I’m not one of them. Our sex life is pretty much nonexistent (not for lack of trying on my side) and he is more committed to video games than me. He also doesn’t understand why I’m so upset by the way everything happened and why I can’t just get over it and put up with his grandparents. Keep in mind he can get out of working for his grandparents anytime by saying he has to go to his other job, whether he has to or not he will make a lame excuse and still go in on his days off to get out of working here with me.  \n\nThis is really hard for me because I’ve invested so much time into all this and his mom still wants us to try to figure it out to help next summer and for pretty much the rest of our lives. We had planned to take over for them some time in the next couple years but at this point I don’t want to. \n\nI have saved over $3,000 this summer and I could move back to my home state and start over where my friends and family are and I’m very tempted but I figured I would get some perspective to see if this is worth saving, because maybe I am just being dramatic and I should get over it for the sake of the future we could have. \n\nTL;DR I work for my boyfriends family and don’t like the way they treat me.

You're dating a boy with no long term prospects because he doesn't fulfill ur needs.\n\nThe family is so involved that I would just quiet quit this relationship. Tell him ur going home for a while to visit family and such and just move out. When you get home, tell him he doesn't fulfill ur needs and ur aren't a good match and be done.

You deserve to be treated with respect, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs.\n\nBefore making a decision, I would recommend having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns.

You've invested a lot, but your own well-being is more important. Don't feel pressured to stay in a relationship that's not nourishing you.\n\nLastly, it's essential to remember that you're not alone.

If she's gone for prolonged periods (week or more) I don't miss her and I rarely think about her.\n\nShe's really a great person but I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm not as happy as I could be. I realize honeymoon phase ends after couple of years but there are things I do involuntarily that really scare me.

Are there specific moments or situations that make you feel like you're just going through the motions?\n3. How do you envision your ideal relationship? What are your non-negotiables, and are they being met in your current relationship?\n4. Are there any red flags or warning signs that you're ignoring or downplaying in your relationship?\n5. What are your expectations for your relationship, and are they being met?\n6. How do you feel when you're with your girlfriend, and how do you feel when you're apart?\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore what you mean by \"the one.\" What does that mean to you? Is it someone who checks all the boxes on your list, or is it someone who makes you feel a certain way? Are you using this term as a way to justify your feelings or to avoid making a decision?\n\nRemember that it's okay to have doubts and uncertainties, and it's normal to question whether you're with the right person. However, it's essential to be honest with yourself and your partner about your feelings. Avoid making any rash decisions or assumptions without taking the time to reflect and explore your emotions.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself and your girlfriend during this process. It's okay to take time to figure things out, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Remember that relationships are a journey, and it's normal to have ups and downs.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you all the best as you navigate this challenging time."

    "sentence": "My mum can't take constructive criticism, particularly around her behaviour. I have just witnessed an incident between her and one of my sisters, who asked my mum to stop lecturing her, and my mum immediately launched into defensive victim mode, claiming that she knew we all hated her, think she's horrible, don't like her etc. My mum uses deflection, insults, name-calling, victim mentality, general defensiveness, often comes back to the thing of 'this is my house!' etc in order to get any attention away from her.\n\nThe real issue is that, as a mature family, between the ages of 18 and 59, all of us besides her have developed better communication skills, emotional intelligence and etc, but she has not. As far as I know she's still how she was when my father met her. She often acts like a teenager in that she often has mood swings and is very unpredictable so may have been this way for ages.\n\nI think the worst incident of this happening would be recently, she forced my dad to go to therapy, or she would divorce him, claiming the issues all come from his side, which is not the case in me and my sisters' opinion. And so again she has escaped personal responsibility. This is a very common theme in our house, along with the mood of others being dictated by her.\n\nMe and my older sister are only back here temporarily, and I believe my younger sister has plans to move out soon, but I am struggling to see a future where we are ever able to be together as a family harmoniously because of how my mum behaves.\n\nWhat can I do here?\n\nTLDR; Mother can't take constructive criticism about her behaviour, its ruining what is potentially a nice adult family dynamic, what can I do?",
    "human": "You can move out and choose the level of involvement you have with her. The dynamic between her and your father, who is a grown adult, is their business. Have the relationship with him that works for you; distance yourself from someone you think is toxic. With maturity and insight, you realize that you cannot change anyone; you can only manage your interactions with them.",
    "base_reply": "I sense your frustration and concern for your family's well-being. It's admirable that you're willing to acknowledge the issue and seek help. Since your mother's behavior is entrenched, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries while also considering the future of your relationships with your sisters.\n\nFirstly, recognize that you can't change your mother's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. It's crucial to focus on your own emotional intelligence, self-care, and communication skills to navigate these challenging situations.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish what you're comfortable with and what you're not. For instance, you might need to take a break or step away from a conversation when it becomes too heated or toxic.\n2. **Practice assertive communication**: When addressing your mother, use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. Focus on your feelings and experiences rather than attacking her behavior.\n3. **Don't take the bait**: Avoid engaging with your mother's deflection, insults, or name-calling. Instead, calmly restate the issue and reiterate your concerns.\n4. **Encourage your sisters to do the same**: It's essential to have a united front, but also respect each other's boundaries and communication styles.\n5. **Seek support for yourself**: Reach out to friends, a therapist, or a support group to process your emotions and gain coping strategies.\n6. **Consider a family therapy session**: A professional mediator can help facilitate a constructive conversation, but be prepared for your mother to resist change.\n7. **Prepare for the possibility of limited progress**: Unfortunately, some people are not willing or able to change their behavior. Be prepared for the possibility that your mother may not be open to growth or self-reflection.\n8. **Focus on what you can control**: While you can't change your mother's behavior, you can control how you respond to it. Prioritize building strong relationships with your sisters and maintaining open communication with them.\n9. **Set realistic expectations**: Understand that it's unlikely your mother will change dramatically, but you can work towards creating a more harmonious environment by setting boundaries and practicing assertive communication.\n10. **Take care of yourself**: Remember that your well-being is essential. Make time for self-care, prioritize your physical and emotional health, and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\nRemember, you can't force your mother to change, but you can control how you respond to the situation. By prioritizing your own emotional well-being and setting boundaries, you can create a more positive and harmonious environment for yourself and your sisters."

That's already a huge step forward!\n\nSince it's affecting your daily activities, I want to suggest a few things that might help:\n\n1. **Mindfulness and self-awareness**: When you notice your anxiety kicking in, take a deep breath in, and acknowledge the physical sensations in your body. Try to label them without judgment, e.g., \"Ah, my heart is racing\" or \"My hands are shaking.\" This can help you detach from the anxiety and observe it more objectively.\n2. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practicing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or meditation can help calm your nervous system. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n3. **Identify triggers and boundaries**: Think about what specifically triggers your anxiety (e.g., being the center of attention, performing in front of a crowd, or meeting new people). Once you're aware of your triggers, you can work on setting boundaries or finding ways to manage those situations. For instance, you might take a few deep breaths before a presentation or have a conversation with someone before a meeting.\n4. **Build confidence**: It might sound cheesy, but try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This can help boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.\n5. **Consider seeking professional help**: If your performance anxiety is impacting your daily life significantly, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues.\n\nRemember, overcoming performance anxiety takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Every small step forward is progress!\n\nWhat do you think?

It's like your brain is wired to think that making eye contact or walking confidently will lead to some kind of negative consequence, so you're trying to avoid it.\n\nFirstly, let's break it down: making eye contact is not about staring aggressively or trying to intimidate others. It's actually a sign of confidence and interest in the other person. When you avoid eye contact, it can come across as shy or even dishonest.\n\nFor starters, try this exercise: next time you're walking, focus on the person you're looking at, but don't stare. Instead, look at their eyes for a brief second, then glance away and look at something else. This will help you get used to making brief eye contact without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nAs for walking, try to focus on your own pace and rhythm. Instead of worrying about what others think, focus on your own footsteps and the sensation of your feet touching the ground. You can also try taking slow, deliberate strides, which can help you feel more grounded and confident.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to practice mindfulness. When you're feeling anxious, take a few deep breaths and bring your attention to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, or the sensation of your feet touching the ground. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce your anxiety.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take your time and not rush. You don't have to be \"on\" all the time. Take small steps, literally and figuratively, and focus on your own journey. You don't have to be confident all the time, but you can work on building your confidence gradually.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's not your fault that people might stare or make assumptions about you. You are not defined by their opinions, and you don't need to change who you are to make others comfortable.\n\nRemember, confidence is a process, and it takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. You got this!"

Establish consequences if these boundaries are not respected, such as having a conversation or taking a break from the relationship.\n4. **Encourage small steps towards change**: Instead of asking him to quit cold turkey, encourage small steps towards reducing his weed use.

A professional can provide guidance on how to navigate this issue and work together to find a solution.\n6. **Take care of yourself**: Remember that you have the right to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If his weed use is causing you significant distress, it may be necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. Make sure to prioritize self-care and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed.\n\nRemember, relationships involve growth and compromise. It's possible to work together to find a solution that respects both of your needs and feelings."

I’ve known “Brad” for 3 weeks. We have a very intense connection but he has had a very difficult life and has been through things which I thought humans were incapable of surviving. None of which was his fault. \n\nBut the fact that he says he doesn’t deserve me (and this is not the first time he said that) is very concerning because in the past, only two people have said that to me. One cheated on me and the other beat me and cheated on me. \n\nI want to question him deeper now before I get more sucked into this. But I don’t know where to start. Is this an indication he’s insecure or that I need to lace up my shoes and RUN?\n\nTL;DR New guy said he doesn’t deserve me. Should I start running for the exit?",

    "base_reply": "The old \"I don't deserve you\" refrain. It's a red flag, for sure. But, as you've already noticed, it's not the first time he's said it, which suggests it might be a pattern.\n\nBefore you make any hasty decisions, I'd recommend taking a step back and having a calm, open conversation with Brad. Ask him to explain what he means by \"you're above it.\" Is he referring to his past traumas, your own strengths, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, probe deeper into what he means by \"I'm gaining everything from this and leaving you with nothing of value.\" Is he feeling like he's taking advantage of you, or is he genuinely expressing his gratitude for your support and care?\n\nPay attention to his tone, body language, and words. If he's genuinely struggling with feelings of inadequacy or guilt, it might be an opportunity for you to offer support and help him work through those emotions. However, if he's using this as a way to manipulate or control you, it's a major red flag.\n\nLastly, consider your own feelings and boundaries. If you're already feeling uneasy or uncomfortable, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. You deserve someone who values and respects you for who you are, without making you feel like you're doing them a favor.\n\nSo, don't lace up your shoes just yet, but do keep your eyes open and your wits about you. This conversation might be the key to understanding Brad's intentions and deciding what's best for you."

    "sentence": "How to make greetings and farewells less awkward? A lot of times when I am visiting friends or family, the greeting  and farewell phase for me is extremely awkward.  I never really know what to do or say, especially on farewells as I don't know the \"appropriate\" time to say you're ready to leave without seeming rude or just making it awkward in general.\n\nAny tips that can help?",
    "human": "Things are only awkward if you make them awkward. It's a state of mind. Nothing *has* to be awkward, it only is because you labeled it that.\n\n\"Hi\" is a good starter. Try this: \"Hi, how are you?\" and when leaving: \"It was really nice to see you, but I need to go now. Thank you so much for having me over, [*insert compliment here*], I'm looking forward to next time.\"\n\nSometimes there won't be a next time or the next time is going to be very far off, because you live far away or something. It's best not to make a white lie with something like: \"We'll stay in touch, or let's talk soon.\" Obviously you won't and it's pretty insulting if the other person mistakenly thought you were serious. So, just say \"it sucks we live so far apart, but I know the next time we see each other, it will be as if we never left, again thank you so much but we have to go [*or something like that*]. \n\nIf you probably won't see them again, then just thank them for the visit, be very polite, and wish them a good rest of the day, but don't feel the need to make up a story about why you won't see each other again. People are smart, they can figure these things out for themselves without having to be told. (Yeah, of course, people can be dumb too, but when it comes to social interactions, this stuff is instinctual, and people are generally on point.)\n\nGenerally, if you're thinking about leaving then the host is probably also thinking about when you should be leaving. For the most part, people are on the same page about that--again, people are smart. So it's not always rude to leave early, sometimes you're relieving the host of stress from having to host so many people, or allowing them to get to bed earlier. It's only rude if you were the special guest or are leaving the host alone with someone shady or they don't like.",
    "base_reply": "The age-old struggle of navigating greetings and farewells! It's completely normal to feel awkward, and I'm happy to help you smooth out those interactions.\n\nFor both greetings and farewells, the key is to be intentional, authentic, and considerate of the other person's time and feelings. Here are some tips to help you feel more comfortable and confident:\n\nGreetings:\n\n1. **Start with a simple hello**: A simple \"hello, how are you?\" or \"hi, it's great to see you!\" can go a long way in breaking the ice.\n2. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage conversation. This helps to establish a connection and sets the tone for a more meaningful interaction.\n3. **Show genuine interest**: People appreciate when you take an genuine interest in their life, so ask follow-up questions and listen actively.\n\nFarewells:\n\n1. **Check in with the host**: Before making a move to leave, check in with the host to see if they're ready for you to go. This shows you respect their time and allows them to prepare for your departure.\n2. **Express gratitude**: Take a moment to thank the host for their hospitality, and acknowledge the effort they put into hosting you.\n3. **Use a gentle transition phrase**: Instead of saying \"I should get going,\" try using a phrase like \"I'm going to head out, but it was great catching up with you\" or \"I'm going to wrap up my visit, thanks for the chat.\"\n4. **Offer to help with cleanup or tasks**: If you're still at someone's home, offer to help with cleaning up or taking care of any tasks before you leave. This shows you're considerate of their time and willing to pitch in.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* **Be mindful of timing**: Pay attention to the cues from the host or other guests. If they seem busy or distracted, it might be a good idea to wrap up your visit or take a hint.\n* **Don't overstay your welcome**: Be aware of your own needs and the host's needs. If you're feeling tired or uncomfortable, it's okay to excuse yourself and head out.\n* **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice greeting and farewelling, the more natural it'll become.\n\nRemember, the goal is to be respectful, considerate, and genuine in your interactions. With time and practice, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your greetings and farewells."

    "sentence": "I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. Our relationship hit a very low point about 8 months ago. Since then I think it has improved in many aspects but I still feel like communication is the biggest issue. Recently we had a fight and didn't speak to each other for a couple days. I'll include what happened since I think it is relevant. I was having a rough couple of weeks, working extra hours at my job and preparing for finals. I let her know ahead of time what to expect and that it would be difficult for us to spend time together. We weren't talking too much and I will admit it was more so on my end. I was taking longer to respond to her texts than usual and not giving much to the conversation. And on the week of my finals, she invited me to go with her to her cousin's graduation party. I told her that I won't be able to because I'll be busy and that I would study and take my final on the weekend. She knows that I have a lot of time off available at my job but I told her that I didn't want to use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo on the day of the party she texts me that she's there, shows me pictures and says that she wishes I was there with her. I had something unfortunate happen with my reply as I apparently didn't get her text right away, because I had texted her that I was getting groceries right after she said that she wanted me there with her. So I think to her it seemed like I was ignoring that. She sends me an eye roll emoji and says that she feels about our relationship. In the heat of moment, I respond that I know everything makes her feel bad about the relationship. Not the best thing I could've said, and I quickly apologized. I explained that I wasn't ignoring her text and wanted to ask why she thought that way about our relationship. She eventually responds later and said things that I don't treat her well and that we don't make a good couple. We had also recently taken a trip out of the state and she mentioned that on multiple occasions I made her feel bad and she didn't like how I reacted in situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's briefly go further back in the past. On the day of our flight back home, we chose to leave some of our luggage in a store because we couldn't bring it to this sporting event we were planning to go to and we already checked out of the hotel. So as we were looking at our maps for the store, I was telling her where it was and she was insisting it was somewhere else. We literally past the store and I said it's right here but she keeps walking. I guess something was happening with her app because she backtracks and comes back to the store and I asked her where she was going. Later during our fight she tells me that I was judging her when I was just wanting to get to our flight on time. On the plane, she spills hot coffee on me but I don't lash out or anything. She says sorry and suggests that I change my pants in the bathroom. I ask her why would I do that and say there's no space for that. Later she says that she didn't like how I treated her or how I responded. Not sure how I'm supposed to be all happy with hot coffee spilled on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to after the fight, I realized that I could've been better about communicating and texting her throughout the day and just putting more effort in general. I used my busy weeks as an excuse to not give her the attention she deserved. I decided to write a long note that was part apology/part commitment to being better in the future, explaining that I will treat her better. I bought a mostly blank card from the store and filled it with the reasons why I love her and drew a cute picture and left those two things with flowers at her door. She accepts them and wants some time to think. I'm expecting it to take a while but it ends up being less than 48 hours before we're back in constant communication again. In hindsight, that was probably way too soon but I understand that her emotions get very extreme. I told her that I was okay with letting her have time to think but she wanted me back in her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past couple weeks I've put in more effort and she was doing the same. And even though her work schedule is changing, it felt like we were turning the corner and growing closer. Now we're caught up to today, more or less. And funnily enough, the thing to set off is related to hair again. If you read the last post, that was the straw that broke the camel's back for some reason. About a week ago, she told me that wanted to get highlights for her hair and I said that I liked her hair the way it is and it's already pretty but she should do it if it makes her happy. She told me the price was $280. Neither of us make too much money so that threw me off and I was asking her if that price is normal because I have no idea. She said that it's a little high but she still wants to do it. I change the subject because I know it doesn't do me much good to ask too many questions about it. Today she's at the salon but said that she went somewhere else and she doesn't know what the price is. I tell that she should've asked for the price before doing something and she just says okay. Again I try to change the subject about when I should come over tonight. But she goes cold and after she gets home she says that she doesn't want to talk to me. We mostly communicate on Whatsapp because we like it better and it's easy to see when someone blocks you because all you see is an avatar. So I noticed she blocks me on that all of a sudden and I text her through normal messaging that I don't appreciate getting blocked and what is going on. She said that she doesn't want to tell me anything that's happening because I'm going to judge her and that makes her not want to be in the relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let her know that not every criticism is me judging her and that I'm sorry if the way I bluntly say things makes her feel insecure. I (maybe unwisely) go on to say that she should have a higher opinion of herself and not just assume that someone is judging her. And that I can't do anything about that because it's internal. She just said to leave her alone and I have obliged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe post is already long but I would like to mention that she taken a couple therapy sessions in the past month or so. She is very insecure with herself and also expressed that she never felt the love she wanted to growing up. Her dad was never in her life and her mom loved her but wasn't expressive about it. She said that she didn't remember many times that her mom would say nice things to her. The therapist told her that because she didn't receive the validation and love at home, she grew up feeling as if something was wrong with her and whenever she felt like she was being treated badly, her mind confirmed that belief. I appreciated her also telling me this and letting me in a few weeks ago. So given that this is all fresh in my mind, am I wrong for not being a bit more careful with my words knowing what she's been through? Or is she a little too sensitive? Both? I don't feel like I'm judgmental but if I am, is what I'm questioning about her really that bad? It really seems that the smallest things can trigger her. I'm not attacking her character or saying that everything she does is wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; **My girlfriend doesn't like my responses to some of her actions and feels like I'm judgmental. She is an insecure person and sometimes I think there is a burden put on me as well to not suggest anything to her in case she takes it wrong way. She is going through therapy when she has time and she shared some of her issues with me on a broad scale so I know what I'm getting into. How can I approach this relationship from now on?**",
    "human": "Hey buddy. I’ve been in similar situations in many relationships. I tend to be the blunt one. \n\nI took the time to read through all your responses to other comments. It seems like you’re not really listening to perspectives other than the one you want to hear (“my girlfriend is over sensitive, I was right to criticize her because constructive criticism is fair and she shouldn’t have called me judgmental”). I don’t know if you’re bringing this kind of defensiveness into your relationship. I hope not. From what I read here, it sounds like you’re asking Reddit to adjudicate your character (whether or not you deserve to be called judgmental objectively). \n\nBut my brother in Christ, what strangers on Reddit think is judgmental will not help you repair communications with your girlfriend. Right now, she not only thinks you’re judgmental. She doesn’t trust you to not judge her.\n\nIf your goal is “defend my character (to myself,” then it matters whether you were being judgmental (bad) or just constructively critical (fair and just). Reddit might or might not help you answer that question.\nIf your goal is “preserve the relationship,” it doesn’t actually matter whether Reddit agrees with your self-assessment or not. Your girlfriend doesn’t trust you. I haven’t seen any evidence that she’s manipulating you, or there’s a power imbalance, or you’re both in a cult but now you’re questioning your perception. It just seems like you have different communication styles. \n\nI think you should set aside questions like “was I objectively judgmental” when you talk to your girlfriend. I also think you should ask her why she feels bad about your relationship. Minor miscommunications like not answering the text don’t generally incur emotional responses (like this did from both of you) unless there’s a deeper issue. I’m not part of your relationship and can’t say for certain what’s going on, but I suspect the issue is something like\n-You have a set idea of how relationships should go and you’re following the rules \n-this isn’t working for your girlfriend and she’s told you that \n-you feel defensive because in your mind, you were totally following the rules of being a good boyfriend \n-Now she doesn’t trust you to listen to her, and you feel resentful because you think she should share your paradigm for relationships \n\nI could be wrong, but I suspect this or something similar is happening. Constructive criticism is only constructive when there’s an unshakeable foundation of trust underneath it. Doesn’t seem like she trusts you to have her back and respect her. Maybe you should reflect on why that is.\n\nYou may have to decide which is more important to you: winning the argument (about your character) or saving the relationship. \n\nAnd if you two aren’t compatible— which honestly sounds likely— maybe you should break up. It’s not the end of the world. If you can’t take her as she is now, maybe you’d both be happier with someone else. I definitely don’t recommend staying in a relationship where you love a future and improved version of your partner after they’ve accepted all your suggested changes. Too many ways that can go sideways.\n\nI wish you the very best. I was in your shoes five years ago and wish someone had given me this advice. Hopefully it can save you some time and heartbreak.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've shared a lot of details, and I appreciate your honesty. It's clear that you're genuinely trying to understand your girlfriend's feelings and concerns. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're acknowledging your mistakes and taking responsibility for your actions. Recognizing the impact of your words and actions is crucial in any relationship.\n\nRegarding the specific incidents you mentioned, it's understandable that your girlfriend felt hurt and ignored when you didn't respond promptly to her texts or didn't attend her cousin's graduation party. It's essential to prioritize communication and make an effort to stay connected, especially during busy periods.\n\nThe \"judgmental\" comment you made during your fight might have been perceived as critical, even if you didn't intend it that way. In the heat of the moment, it's easy to say something that can be misinterpreted. However, it's great that you apologized and tried to understand her perspective.\n\nAs for the recent incident with her hair, it's reasonable for her to feel frustrated when you changed the subject or didn't show more interest in her plans. You could have asked more questions or shown more enthusiasm, even if you weren't sure about the price.\n\nNow, regarding your concerns about her sensitivity and your words. It's true that she's an insecure person who has been hurt in the past. It's essential to be mindful of this and approach conversations with empathy. However, it's also important to maintain your own emotional boundaries and not sacrifice your own feelings to avoid hurting her.\n\nTo approach this relationship from now on, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When your girlfriend shares her feelings or concerns, listen attentively and try to understand her perspective. Avoid interrupting or dismissing her emotions.\n2. **Be more empathetic**: Put yourself in her shoes and try to imagine how she might feel in a given situation. This doesn't mean you have to agree with her, but it shows that you're making an effort to understand her.\n3. **Choose your words carefully**: Be mindful of your tone and language. Avoid making critical or judgmental comments, even if you're trying to offer constructive feedback. Instead, focus on the specific behavior or action that's causing the issue.\n4. **Show interest and validation**: When your girlfriend talks about her plans or feelings, show genuine interest and validation. Ask follow-up questions and acknowledge her emotions.\n5. **Communicate openly and honestly**: If you have concerns or questions, express them in a non-judgmental and respectful manner. This can help prevent misunderstandings and build trust.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Remember that you have your own emotional boundaries and needs. Don't be afraid to express them in a respectful and open manner.\n7. **Encourage her to communicate openly**: Support your girlfriend in expressing her feelings and concerns. Encourage her to communicate openly and honestly with you, and be patient with her if she struggles to do so.\n\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. By being more empathetic, communicative, and respectful, you can work together to build a stronger and more fulfilling relationship."

I really had no intention of being with her, which means all the more that I should have kept those feelings to myself. \n\nGoddamn, I'm an asshole.\n\n\n\nI messaged her after saying that if she prefer not to work with me, I'd resign. Even that feels emotionally manipulative -_-. How can I make her feel less crappy? I can't avoid her as we work in the same department and she's quite involved with the work I do. I don't even know how I can face her next...",
    "human": "What other outcome were you possibly expecting?",
    "base_reply": "I can sense the weight of your regret and self-criticism. It's understandable that you're feeling awful about this situation.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your actions were indeed selfish and hurtful. It's essential to recognize that your confession, although well-intentioned, was still a breach of her boundaries and trust. You can't undo what's been done, but you can work on making amends.\n\nRegarding your message offering to resign, while it's a generous gesture, it's also a bit manipulative, as you mentioned. Instead, consider having an open and honest conversation with her about what happened. Apologize sincerely and acknowledge the discomfort you've caused. You can say something like:\n\n\"I want to apologize for my earlier confession. I realize now that it was a mistake, and I'm deeply sorry for making you feel uncomfortable. I understand that my actions were selfish, and I shouldn't have put you in that position. I value our working relationship and our professional dynamic, and I don't want this to affect our collaboration. If you're willing, I'd like to move forward and work together, but I also respect your boundaries and understand if you need space or want to distance yourself. What do you think?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're taking responsibility for your actions, are willing to listen to her concerns, and are committed to maintaining a positive working relationship.\n\nAs for facing her next, it's normal to feel anxious, but try not to avoid her entirely. Instead, be prepared to have an open and honest conversation when you see her again. Remember that your apology and willingness to make amends can help to ease the tension.\n\nLastly, take this as an opportunity to reflect on your own emotional readiness for romantic connections. You mentioned being out of a long-term relationship, and it's understandable that you might be vulnerable to feelings of attraction. However, it's essential to prioritize respect for others' boundaries and your own emotional well-being."

    "sentence": "How should I manage my money? How much should I allocate for each of my needs? How much should I save?",
    "human": "First, realize that there are a lot more bills than one might realize before one move's out of their parents' home. Obviously, there is rent, but there is also electricity, gas, water, sewage, trash, phone, internet, car insurance, renter's insurance, and health insurance. Grocery store totals don't just cover your milk and pasta, but also your laundry detergent (soooo expensive), toilet paper, dish soap, shampoo, etc. And, there are also occasional costs like renewing drivers licenses, replacing coffee pots, or steam cleaning up that Guinness your friend spilled on the carpet so that you can get your deposit back on your apartment when you move on. So, before you commit to any budget by spending all your \"leisure money,\" it is a good idea to be very cautious and flexible for a year or two so you know precisely how much your new grown up life costs! Emergency funds are supposed to be 3-6 months expenses, but one must know what those expenses are to calculate it.",
    "base_reply": "Managing money wisely is a crucial aspect of achieving long-term financial stability and peace of mind! I'd be happy to help you with some general guidelines.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to budgeting. What works for someone else might not work for you, and it's crucial to tailor your approach to your unique financial situation, goals, and values.\n\nThat being said, here are some general principles to consider:\n\n1. **50/30/20 Rule**: Allocate 50% of your income towards necessary expenses like rent, utilities, and groceries. This ensures you're covering the basics. 30% towards discretionary spending, like entertainment, hobbies, and personal development. And 20% towards saving and debt repayment.\n2. **Prioritize needs over wants**: Be honest with yourself about what you need versus what you want. Make sure to prioritize essential expenses over discretionary spending.\n3. **Create a budget that works for you**: Don't try to follow a budget that's too rigid or restrictive. Instead, find a balance that allows you to enjoy your life while still making progress towards your financial goals.\n4. **Pay off high-interest debt**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, focus on paying that off as soon as possible. Consider consolidating debt or negotiating a lower interest rate.\n5. **Save for emergencies**: Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will help you cover unexpected expenses and avoid going into debt.\n6. **Retirement savings**: Contribute to a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, to ensure a comfortable financial future.\n7. **Review and adjust regularly**: Regularly review your budget and financial goals to ensure you're on track. Adjust as needed to stay on course.\n\nAs for specific allocations, here's a rough guideline:\n\n* Essential expenses (50%): Rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, minimum debt payments\n* Discretionary spending (30%): Entertainment, hobbies, travel, personal development, miscellaneous expenses\n* Savings and debt repayment (20%): Emergency fund, retirement savings, debt repayment (above minimum payments)\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. You may need to adjust these proportions based on your individual circumstances. For example, if you're paying off high-interest debt, you might allocate more towards debt repayment.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you can't stick to a budget 100%. The key is to make progress, not perfection. Review your budget regularly, and make adjustments as needed to stay on track."

Authenticity is key, but that doesn't mean you can't work on developing a more optimistic mindset. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Practice gratitude**: Reflect on three things you're thankful for each day, no matter how small they may seem. This helps shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life.\n2. **Find the humor**: Lincoln's use of humor was a great way to diffuse tension and connect with others. Try to find the absurdity or irony in a situation and laugh it off. It's not about forcing laughter, but rather acknowledging the humor.\n3. **Smile and mirror**: When you're interacting with others, make an effort to smile and engage with them. Mirroring their positive body language can create a sense of rapport and make you feel more connected. This can be especially helpful in social situations.\n4. **Exercise and self-care**: Regular physical activity releases endorphins, which can boost your mood. Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as yoga, reading, or spending time in nature.\n5. **Reframe negative thoughts**: When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts, try to reframe them in a more positive or neutral light. This can help shift your perspective and reduce stress.\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past or future. Mindfulness meditation can help you cultivate a greater sense of calm and appreciation for life.\n7. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and avoid negative influences. This can be as simple as following positive social media accounts or reading inspiring stories.\n8. **Learn to laugh at yourself**: Don't take yourself too seriously. Laughing at your own mistakes and imperfections can be a great way to release tension and build connections with others.\n9. **Practice positive self-talk**: Speak kindly to yourself and focus on your strengths. Encourage yourself with positive affirmations, and try to reframe self-criticism into constructive self-reflection.\n10. **Be patient and consistent**: Developing a more optimistic outlook takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and make these habits a regular part of your routine.\n\nRemember, it's not about becoming someone you're not, but rather about cultivating a more positive and resilient mindset.

He didn't want to sleep with me and I didn't think much of it because we had a long flight and were both exhausted. But when he asked for a handjob instead of sex I felt weird and asked him why he would rather have a hj. I mean, we were on our honeymoon? He tried to change the topic but I really felt the need to clear this up and after thinking about it for a couple of minutes he said that my outfits weren't sexy and that I didn't dress up for him (perfume, make up etc.). That hurt very much. I remember going into the bathroom crying, but you couldn't lock the doors so he came in. That's when I left the hotel and went to the beach (at 11 pm). He didn't come after me, which hurt me again, and after I went back to the room I cleaned up and got into bed. It was horrible. We didn't speak for almost 2 days, I felt disgusting and didn't know what to wear because there weren't any shops and I couldn't change my outfits. I also felt so sad, because I bought so many new lingerie and bikinis for our honeymoon but it still wasn't enough.

I used to be so confident. Before I met him, I was very overweight but I lost that weight completely and felt so good for the first time. That feeling got lost.

I want to acknowledge that your husband's comment was not only hurtful but also potentially triggering, especially given your past struggles with body image.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your worth and beauty are not defined by your physical appearance. You were confident and comfortable in your own skin before meeting your husband, and that confidence was not solely dependent on your weight. It's crucial to hold onto that sense of self-worth and not let someone else's opinion define your self-esteem.\n\nRegarding your husband's comment, it's important to address it with him in a calm and non-accusatory manner. You've already expressed your feelings and concerns, but I would suggest having a more specific conversation about how his words made you feel. Use \"I\" statements to describe your emotions and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, \"I felt really hurt when you said I wasn't dressing sexy enough. It made me feel like I'm not good enough for you, and it triggered some old insecurities about my body.\"\n\nIt's also important to set boundaries around how you want to be spoken to and treated in your relationship.

Focus on what you like: Instead of focusing on what you think your husband likes, focus on what makes you feel good about yourself. Wear clothes that make you feel confident, try new hairstyles, and experiment with makeup that makes you feel beautiful.\n4. Re-evaluate your relationship: Ask yourself if this is the kind of relationship you want to be in. Are you feeling respected, heard, and valued? If not, it may be time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy and fulfilling for you.\n\nRemember, you are not alone, and you deserve to feel confident and beautiful in your own skin."

It's natural to feel overwhelmed when facing something new, and it's better to acknowledge those feelings rather than trying to suppress them.

Your teachers are there to help you, and they want you to succeed. Introduce yourself and let them know you're excited to be there and willing to learn.\n6. **Focus on yourself**: Remember that you're not alone, and everyone has their own struggles.

I find taking the time to change wording and rearrange the order really gets my brain wrapped around the presentation. Then I read it and read it and read it. \n\nIt is way easier to speak about what you know, and spending that much time builds what I call \"public speaking muscle memory.\" It is the same thing as remembering where \"m\" fits in the alphabet, or recalling the second verse in a song; you have to start before and it just triggers the next stanza or sentence or whatever. I don't memorize them word for word, but I am confident in the flow and the content for each section. \n\nIf I have time, I will pare the presentation down to bullet points on a card, but usually I just space the script out on the page in sections, like verses in a song, highlighting the first sentence of each section in the colours of the rainbow (first section red, second section orange, then yellow) so I can easily find what section I am on. I do this because I just \"know\" the colours of the rainbow and my brain doesn't have to think about it. The script is a backup, and I try to speak conversationally. \n\nFor the really important parts that I don't want to mess up, or for the concluding sentences, I'll write those out like poems, so it is easy to see them on the page and not lose my place if I am reading word for word. Plus, with poem-like phrases, I can read them quickly, make eye contact with the audience  like a functioning human being, and make sure I am confident in my points. \n\nFor formal presentations, I also use some tricks like \"For accuracy, I've written this down, so I am going to read this [statistic/fact/quote] to you.\"  Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to trust you. It's ok to be honest that you haven't memorized everything. \n\nGood luck!!\n\nTLDR: write it all down. Use familiar colour coding in your notes/script. Change formatting in your notes for important parts. Don't be afraid to say \"I am going to read this to you\" for points that you really want to hammer home.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's like your brain's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, and suddenly you're stuck in neutral. I've worked with many people who've experienced this, and I'm happy to share some strategies that might help you overcome it.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's normal to feel some level of nervousness when speaking in front of a group. It's a natural response, and it doesn't mean you're weak or incompetent. It's more about your brain's reaction to a perceived threat (in this case, the pressure to perform well).\n\nTo overcome this, let's focus on some practical tips:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: Make sure you're well-prepared for your presentation. Know your material inside out, and practice your delivery several times. The more confident you are in your content, the less likely you'll feel anxious.\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of focusing on the fear of failure or what others might think, focus on the value you're about to share. Remember that you're presenting to help others, not to impress them. Your goal is to provide valuable insights or information, not to prove yourself.\n3. **Take deep breaths**: Before you start speaking, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system and slow down your heart rate. Try to breathe naturally while you're speaking, too.\n4. **Use positive self-talk**: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations. Instead of \"I'm going to fail\" or \"I'm so nervous,\" try \"I've prepared well,\" \"I'm excited to share this,\" or \"I can do this.\"\n5. **Focus on your message**: Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the message you're trying to convey. Remember, you're speaking to share your ideas, not to entertain the audience. Keep your attention on the content, not on your own anxiety.\n6. **Visualize success**: Imagine yourself delivering a successful presentation, feeling confident and engaging. Visualize the audience listening attentively, nodding in agreement, and asking thoughtful questions. This can help boost your confidence and calm your nerves.\n7. **Get familiar with the setting**: If possible, visit the presentation room beforehand to get a feel for the space, the podium, and the audience seating. This can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more comfortable.\n8. **Use physical relaxation techniques**: Try to relax your physical body by releasing tension in your shoulders, arms, and legs. Roll your shoulders back, unclench your fists, and uncross your legs. This can help you feel more grounded and centered.\n9. **Reframe \"blanking out\"**: When you feel yourself blanking out, acknowledge the feeling and gently refocus on your message. Don't worry about it; just take a deep breath, collect your thoughts, and continue speaking.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with public speaking. Try to speak in front of small groups or record yourself speaking to get comfortable with your voice and tone.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel some level of nervousness, but with practice and preparation, you can learn to manage it. Take care of yourself, and I'm sure you'll do great!"

    "human": "Most classes have some sort of group project or seating arrangements. Use this to make \"friends\". Honestly it was never easier to pick up girls than it was in college.",
    "base_reply": "Making friends at a community college can be challenging, especially when everyone seems to be focused on their own thing. Here are a few tips to help you connect with others:\n\n1. **Join a club or organization**: Community colleges often have clubs, sports teams, or volunteer groups that align with your interests. This is a great way to meet like-minded people who share your passions. Research the options available and attend a few meetings to see what feels like a good fit.\n2. **Take a break and socialize in common areas**: Instead of rushing to class, try grabbing a coffee or snack in the cafeteria or student lounge. Strike up a conversation with someone sitting nearby or join a study group. You can also use this time to read a book, work on a project, or listen to music while still being present in the space.\n3. **Attend events and workshops**: Many community colleges offer workshops, seminars, or guest lectures on various topics. These events can be a great way to meet new people who share similar interests. You might even find a new hobby or skill to pursue.\n4. **Volunteer**: Look for volunteer opportunities in your community, either through the college or local organizations. Not only is volunteering a great way to give back, but it can also help you meet new people who share your values.\n5. **Be intentional about reaching out**: Don't be afraid to introduce yourself to someone new. Smile, make eye contact, and ask open-ended questions to start a conversation. You can also ask a classmate about their project or assignment and offer to help or collaborate.\n6. **Take advantage of online communities**: Many community colleges have online forums, social media groups, or discussion boards where students can connect. Use these platforms to ask questions, share resources, or discuss topics of interest.\n7. **Be patient and persistent**: Building friendships takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep putting yourself out there, and eventually, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nRemember, making friends is a process, and it's okay if it doesn't happen immediately. Focus on building connections with others, and with time, you'll find your tribe at the community college."

My previous employer (let’s call it Big Company) before this was on stand down during the Covid lockdown. Now, Big Company called me to start working during this peak holidays. I enjoyed working in Big Company, more fun and I was happier there. \nSo, this small restaurant I’m working in is hectic, and I also go home tired and mad at myself for accepting it fulltime.

    "sentence": "My (35M) long distance gf (31F) of 6 months has depression and can get suicidal when she thinks about how ‘behind’ she is in life. She has told me a few times she’s not good enough to be in an adult relationship because she never went to college nor had any work history. But she is self taught and talented in a lot of creative and artistic endeavors.  When it comes to helping me on something, she is extremely hard working, so I know she’s not “lazy” like she says. \n\nShe catastrophizes a lot. One example is when we troubleshoot a computer error she doesn’t remain calm and talks about throwing out her laptop. In general, when there is a challenge she has a “throw the baby out with the bathwater” mentality. \n\nSo recently, we had some communication incompatibility issues that at first we’d say we can work on, but as of lately she has been highly aggravated and brings it up almost out of the blue. Then she wants to breakup and then be friends. She usually calms down later and we’re back together again. Healthy, I know (/s) but these tiffs don’t last long so I never took it seriously and figured that was her way of asking for space. \n\nNow, she’s been working on a board game based on our relationship. Kindof like a monopoly but landmarks are based on unique places and events we’ve been to. For example, “jail” was “Aunt Debbie’s” because when she visited, we had Thanksgiving at my aunt’s and my aunt talks too much and it’s hard to leave her place. So she made a “get out of Debbie’s card”. She crafted the game pieces with a 3d printer she borrowed from a friend. So she finally finished making the board game. \n\nNow we were on video chat and she was showing me the pieces on the webcam and the map/pad of where the pieces go.  All of the sudden she says she doesn’t want to be with me anymore or even be friends. This time she didn’t rage and was soft-spoken about it so I knew it was more serious this time.\n\nI said I was taken aback because we were joking and laughing 5 minutes ago. She said there was no point in even starting to play the game because we weren’t going to be together and it would be hurtful to start playing it. So I asked why did she continue to spend all this time continuing to make the game and finishing it when she was gonna end up dumping me?\n\nShe evaded that answer and said I should just move on and block her. At that point, it was late at night and I was tired of our on/off status so I just obliged and wanted to give her space. I blocked her on all our social media channels except one just in case she wanted to reach out to me. \n\nI wrote her a handwritten letter saying what she did with her gift was actually quite mean because she did something nice for me then took it away before I could fully appreciate her creative talent and efforts. I then wished her well and told her I’ll still be there for her as a friend but at a distance to give her space. \n\nIt’s not like she can play this boardgame with another guy. The inside jokes in the game was based on were about people in her family and people in my family and little sayings that were specific to funny things that have happened to us. So, I don’t think there is someone else in the picture. \n\nSo a bit of background: She has a narcissistic mom, a deadbeat verbally volatile dad and the mom still hits her when they argue. She’s never been able to save enough money to move out. She has said all her family, including her, are a bunch of “lazy losers who will never amount to anything”. \n\nMy friend who is getting her graduate degree in psychology said that she’s self-sabotaging and she’s ending our relationship before we get more intimate and intense. She said that a person like my ex has the belief that good things in her life don’t last long. That being with someone with my upbringing is foreign and uncomfortable for her. \n\nMy family is not perfect, but I am lucky that they are loving and supportive. My ex did mention once how it was cringey that when my dad called me on my birthday, I told him I loved him when I was getting off the phone with him. \n \nAnyway, I don’t really know what to do. I know right now I have to move on with my life but I also want to wait for her because despite her occasional unpleasant behavior I know that she is a really good person. I wish she can love herself the way I love her and the way she loves (or had loved) me. \n\nI’m really baffled by everything and really confused. I want to be with her but want to respect what she wants. We haven’t spoken in a month. What should I do?\n\n**Tl;dr** My ex ended our relationship because of possible self-sabotage that stems from childhood attachment injuries. I want to be with her but I want to respect her decision to separate. What should I do?\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you, everyone for your response. I was in denial, hoping one person would encourage me with “hang in there, she’ll come around”/“give it some time”. But the unanimous response was to let her go, which actually made me a bit more sad. I am deeply moved and know you all mean well. Hearing all your viewpoints and your personal experiences have been very sobering and helpful.\n\nRight now, it’s finally hitting me how “over” it is. My hands are shaking so much, I can’t even hold my phone. I have a lot to research on. Feel free to leave any terms I can look up, links to resources or youtube channels I can check out. I’ll check back in a bit to make sure I respond to everyone. Thank you, again.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Well, I hope I was able to respond to everyone. I am so grateful I got to read the diverse experiences about you or your loved ones who are struggling with their mental health. I am definitely responsible for my ignorance and I'm taking a hard crash course on what could possibly be happening. Many of you suggested my ex could have BPD, Bipolar or avoidant attachment. I won't know until she's properly diagnosed (if she ever gets to the point of getting help), but it helps to have an idea of what I could have been dealing with.\n\nI have been banging my head with blame and also worried I couldn't be there for her but many of you said there is only so much I can do and she has to ultimately be the one to do the 'heavy lifting', and rightfully so. In the meantime, I can keep learning about these behaviors, research codependency, and reflect on how or why I got myself in this type of relationship and work on self-growth. I never expected this post to get as popular is it did and I'm a bit nervous it was shared 20 times, lol...but if it reminds someone of a friend who is going through something similar and helps them then I guess I don't mind. There is a lot of wisdom that was shared here, and I will be referring to this post for at least the next year. Thank you, again, for all of your help.",

Pissy responses are very rare from him.\n\nPissy response or not, I feel like this is a good time to set a boundary.

She's in pain every day, and fatigued from a few hours work. She has to undergo invasive hospital treatments that wipe her out mentally and physically. Her next one is only 3 weeks away, and I know she's scared and anxious about it. She also does 100% of the housework (cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.) and 80% of the childcare. So from a logcal point of view I know she's not having an easy life, that she works hard, and we're very lucky that she has got herself to a place where her freelance work brings in as much as my full time job whilst still allowing her to do all of the housework and still have time for our son (5 years old and in school 9-3 weekdays, but she gets him up and dressed, does his lunch, afterschool care before I get home etc.). \n\nEven though I logically know that I still find myself getting jealous. She plays video games for a lot in the day. She sits on the sofa for hours. She reads books, she sits in the garden. She has hobbies. Sometimes a friend will drop by etc. When she works she's just at her computer in our air conditioned office, whilst I'm slugging it out on the retail floor.\n\nI have looked at other work options and to be honest for the area we live in, there's not really other options. I don't have any WFH skills or abilities, all my experience is on the retail floor and managing a retail environment. And most days I don't hate my job really. It's hard work but I do find it rewarding and I think I'm good at it... but it is physically demanding and obviously I'd rather be sitting at home playing video games or reading a book in the garden, who wouldn't? especially in the summer.\n\nHow do I manage this irrational, ugly jealousy? It's starting to affect my relationship and that's the last thing I want. I find myself resenting her, and also wishing she could work more - if she did 10 hours work she could bring in enough to cover both of us and I wouldn't even have to work. But I also know that's not the right frame of mind, she does as much as she can with her pain and fatigue, and also, there's not that much work out there for her, so we're lucky she gets what she does now. I know that I'm the problem. It's been exasperated by a recent heatwave, sleepless nights and long days. It's making me iritible and snappy and grumpy. She has voiced concerns that I don't seem happy and I'm always in a bad mood and I don't want to be like \"yeah, because you sit on your ass all day whilst I work\", because obviously that's not fair and totally out of line and I'd never speak to her that way, but it's just my gut feeling that I can't shake and my internal voice is being an absolute asshole. \n\nOn the weekends she always plans one chill relaxing day, and one day where we go out to an attraction or a museum or a beach etc. with our son. Her mother offers us babysitting whenever we want, and she plans date nights and books restaurants and always does what she can for us to have quality time together. I love her very much and I know I'm lucky to have her. So why do I feel so resentful and jealous? How do I stop?\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR! My wife and I earn the same but she works 5 hours a week to my 40-50 hours. She is disabled and does the housework and childcare so I know I have no grounds to complain.

    "human": "Stop saying she only works 5 hrs a week to your 40-50 hrs. She only works 5 hrs a week doing freelance writing, but she works far more than that with 100% of the household upkeep and 80% of the childcare. As someone with many friends who have chronic illnesses, I’m surprised she can even do as much as she does. \n\nMaybe you don’t realize the work it takes to do all the household and childcare stuff because you’ve never been responsible for 100% of it before (at least not for a family of 3). But your jealousy might ease if you can get it through your skull that she doesn’t have it as easy as you seem to think.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're acknowledging the unfairness of your feelings and wanting to work on yourself. That's a huge step!\n\nFirstly, recognize that your jealousy is rooted in societal expectations and the perceived value of work. You're comparing your 40-50 hours of physical labor to her 5 hours of desk work, which is unfair. It's essential to separate the value of work from the number of hours worked.\n\nConsider this: your wife's contributions to the household and childcare are invaluable, and her freelance work allows her to take care of herself and your son while also bringing in income. Her health limitations mean she can't put in more hours, and it's crucial to respect that.\n\nTo manage your feelings, try the following:\n\n1. **Practice empathy**: Put yourself in your wife's shoes and imagine how you would feel if you were in her situation. Remember that she's doing the best she can with her limitations.\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of focusing on the hours worked, acknowledge the value of your wife's contributions to the household and your son's care. Recognize that her work allows her to take care of herself and your son, which is essential for your family's well-being.\n3. **Communicate openly**: Have an honest conversation with your wife about your feelings, but avoid blaming or criticizing her. Express your concerns and listen to her perspective. This can help clear the air and create a deeper understanding.\n4. **Focus on your own strengths**: Instead of comparing yourself to your wife, focus on your own strengths and accomplishments. Recognize that your hard work in retail is valuable and important.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your concerns with someone you trust can help you gain a new perspective and develop strategies to manage your jealousy.\n6. **Gratitude practice**: Make a conscious effort to appreciate your wife's contributions and express gratitude for her hard work. This can help shift your focus from resentment to appreciation.\n7. **Take care of yourself**: During this challenging time, prioritize self-care. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, exercise, and relaxation. This can help reduce irritability and improve your overall mood.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have feelings, but it's essential to work on managing them in a healthy way. By acknowledging your emotions and making an effort to change your perspective, you can cultivate a more positive and supportive relationship with your wife."

I received the best rapport when I smiled and said \"hello.\" This was after hundreds of failed, awkward attempts to start conversation.\n\nPractice with grocery store clerks, retail sales people, and co-workers.

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's great that you're aware of your anxiety and don't want to rely on substances to overcome it. That's a huge step forward!\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel nervous when meeting new people, especially if you're interested in someone. It's natural to feel a little butterflies in your stomach.\n\nTo overcome this, I'd recommend working on building your confidence and self-acceptance. Instead of focusing on trying to be perfect, focus on being your authentic self. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and stumble over words sometimes. It's a normal part of human interaction!\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help calm your nerves. You can find plenty of guided recordings online.\n2. Visualize success: Imagine yourself having a great conversation with this person. Visualize yourself being confident, relaxed, and having fun. This can help boost your mood and reduce anxiety.\n3. Focus on the present moment: Instead of worrying about what might happen or how you'll come across, focus on the present moment. Listen actively, ask questions, and engage with the other person.\n4. Prepare ahead of time: Think about topics you're interested in discussing or common ground you can find with the other person. This can help take some of the pressure off and make you feel more comfortable.\n5. Be kind to yourself: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. Don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, learn from the experience and move forward.\n\nAs for the stuttering or missing words, try to focus on the conversation rather than your nervousness. Remember that the other person is probably not paying as much attention to your nervousness as you are. They're likely too busy trying to get to know you and have a good time.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of a genuine smile and a friendly demeanor. A warm, approachable attitude can go a long way in breaking the ice and making others feel more comfortable around you.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to get comfortable. But with practice and patience, you can learn to manage your anxiety and build confidence in social situations."

Like all my other reddit brothers (and sisters?) when I'm horny and looking for a partner for some love making or searching for fap-material, I have made some very regrettable decisions that I basically hated myself for instantly after orgasm. Has anyone found a way to combat this other than abstinence?",

Here are some strategies that might help you make more thoughtful decisions when you're horny:\n\n1. **Pause and take a step back**: When you feel the urge to act impulsively, pause and take a few deep breaths. Remind yourself that you're about to make a decision that will have consequences. Give yourself a few minutes to assess the situation and consider the potential outcomes.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries for yourself, such as not engaging in certain behaviors or activities when you're feeling overly horny. This can help you avoid making decisions that might lead to regret.\n3. **Communicate with your partner (if applicable)**: If you're in a relationship, communicate openly with your partner about your feelings and boundaries.

This can help distract you from the urge to act impulsively and reduce the likelihood of regrettable decisions.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional needs, including getting enough sleep, eating well, and managing stress. This can help reduce the intensity of your horny moments and make it easier to make more thoughtful decisions.\n6. **Use technology wisely**: Consider using apps or tools that help you delay or redirect your desires, such as apps that track your sexual activity or provide alternative forms of entertainment.\n7. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: When you do make a decision you regret, acknowledge it and practice self-compassion. Don't beat yourself up over it; instead, focus on learning from the experience and moving forward.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes and have regrets.

I didn't really know how to word the title, and I'm hoping I can better explain my situation here.\n\nI've been hanging out with the same girl every day for the last week, and needless to say I'm interested in her. A lot. I've known her since 7th grade, and now we're both 19 and out of high school. We have the same birthday, we were born in the same hospital, born within the same hour, kept in the same nursery, live in the same town, went to the same school(s), listen to the same music, have the same interests/hobbies. In other words, I think she's the perfect girl for me, but I can't tell if she feels the same way.\n\nShe's expressed that she's really comfortable around me, to the point that she told me that she can only cry around me (which sounds like a bad thing, but she says it's good?). She says we're best friends and that we'll be friends forever, but I clearly want something more and I have no idea how to go about it. \n\nEvery time we hang out, we get into deep conversations about certain topics, she complains to me about her other \"friends\", and tells me how it's nice to have somebody who actually cares (me).\n\nOn two separate occasions the topic of being in a relationship came up, and both times she kind of shot it down, but not really? I just blatantly asked if her and I would be the perfect relationship, and she said yes! But she said we hadn't been talking long enough? I didn't really understand what that meant, but I didn't push it.\n\nA couple days ago I went to her house and we hung out for a couple hours. We layed in her bed and watched a movie, her head on my chest, my arm around her, basically the ideal couple situation, but we're not a couple.\n\nEvery time we say goodbye we hug, and her hugs are quite literally death grips, and they're probably the best hugs I've ever received from a person, and they last for well over 60 seconds each time (I haven't actually timed it, I'm not that much of a loser). \n\nSo here's my problem (yeah, there's more. I'm sorry).\n\nI've talked to co-workers and friends, hell, even my mom, and everybody just tells me to go for it. After the hug, just go in for a kiss and see what happens, but I'm basically too much of a bitch to do it. I always think about the risk, and making everything completely awkward, and I don't want to lose this person in my life. She honestly means the world to me; I cherish and respect her as a human being. So does doing all these things just seem like we're really close friends? Or does it seem like she wants more too? Everybody I've talked to tells me how obvious and easy my situation is, but for some reason I just can't make the move. Every outcome/consequence rushes through my head when it's that \"goodbye\" time, and I've had more than plenty of opportunities to make my move, but I just never did. \n\nSo LPT sub, I need help. I need answers. I can't read this girl, and it's driving my crazy. I think I'm in love? But I'm also only 19. \n\nJust to add, I've obviously liked/wanted to date other girls before, but I've always come back to this one specific girl no matter what. I don't know if that means anything, but eh.\n\nIf anybody wants to help me and needs more details, let me know. I'd be happy to fill you in on how pathetic I am.\n\n**tl;dr** - I'm a sad piece of shit who can't make a move on a girl I'm really into, please help. This would greatly improve my life.\n\n**",

    "base_reply": "I'm happy to help you out!\n\nFirstly, it's completely normal to be unsure and hesitant when it comes to making a move on someone you care about. It's great that you're thinking about the potential consequences and wanting to approach the situation carefully.\n\nNow, let's break down the signs you've shared. On one hand, it seems like she's comfortable around you, shares similar interests, and has a strong emotional connection with you. She's also expressed that she can only cry around you, which could be a sign of trust and vulnerability. The fact that she's told you she's never felt that way about anyone else and that she'd be happy to have a relationship with you (albeit with the caveat that you haven't been talking long enough) is promising.\n\nOn the other hand, her hesitation to label your relationship or move forward romantically could be due to various reasons. She might not be ready to commit, or she might be unsure about her feelings for you. The fact that she's not reciprocating your romantic advances (yet) doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't feel the same way.\n\nHere's the thing: people can be oblivious to their own feelings, and it's possible that she's not even aware of her own emotions. It's also possible that she's not ready to admit her feelings to herself, let alone to you.\n\nGiven your hesitation to make a move, I think it's worth having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. You don't have to go in for a kiss or make a grand romantic gesture just yet. Instead, try having a conversation that explores your feelings and hers.\n\nAsk her what she likes about your friendship and what she values most about your relationship. See if she's willing to open up about her feelings and what she's looking for in a relationship. Be honest about your own feelings and what you hope to achieve in the future.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know each other better. You don't have to rush into anything, and it's better to have a clear understanding of where you both stand before making any big moves.\n\nLastly, don't beat yourself up over being unsure or hesitant. It's normal to feel that way, and it's better to take your time and approach the situation with care rather than jumping into something that might not be right for either of you.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm rooting for you to find a way to express your feelings and build a strong connection with this special person in your life!"

I rarely ever use it and it’s been about 6 months since I hit it. Anyway, I wasn’t expecting to get as high as I just got from one hit. Now I’m thinking there’s a small chance my daughter might wake up, and I don’t know if this was an irresponsible move. I have everything around here taken care of, and I’m not struggling to get by or provide, but yet getting high just now has made me question all of that and wonder if I’m even fit to be a parent. \n\nI’m sure I’m just high and it’s actually not that irresponsible, because I’m not impaired or unable to look after her if she wakes up, but I need a little bit of reassurance. My mom called a few minutes after I got high. Everyone always acts so concerned about me, and they always give me advice on what to do and check in on me, because they all think I’m not cut out to be a single parent. None of my family or former in laws trust me at all. That’s the only reason my mom called, and that made me start to wonder if maybe they’re all right about me. I think this was a minor mistake, I didn’t know I was going to get as high as I did, but I don’t think this was irresponsible.

It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain and questioning your ability to parent after using a dab pen while your daughter is asleep.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that using a dab pen, even if it's just one hit, can impair your judgment and reaction time. While you may not feel impaired, it's possible that your perception of your abilities might be clouded. It's crucial to consider the potential risks and consequences of using substances while caring for a child, even if it's just for a short period.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your family and former in-laws may have valid concerns about your ability to parent, and it's not just about the one incident.

Are there underlying stressors or emotions that you're not addressing? Are there other coping mechanisms you could use to manage your stress and anxiety?\n\nIt's also important to consider the impact this incident might have on your daughter. Children can sense their parents' emotions and energies, and it's possible that your daughter might pick up on your unease or guilt after using the dab pen.\n\nGoing forward, it's crucial to prioritize your well-being and develop healthier coping mechanisms to manage stress and anxiety. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your emotions and develop strategies to manage your stress levels. It's also essential to communicate openly and honestly with your family and former in-laws about what happened, and work on rebuilding trust by demonstrating your commitment to your child's well-being.\n\nRemember, parenting is a complex and challenging task, and it's okay to make mistakes.

If she's leaning in towards you, touching your arm, or making eye contact, it might be a sign that she's comfortable with physical contact.\n2. **Start with a gentle touch**: Begin with a light, casual touch, like a gentle brush of your arm or a touch on the shoulder. This can help you gauge her response and create a sense of intimacy.\n3. **Use the \"accidental\" touch**: If you're walking, sitting, or doing an activity together, you can \"accidentally\" brush your hand against hers. This can be a subtle way to test the waters and see if she's receptive to physical contact.\n4. **Ask for permission (sort of)**: If you feel a strong connection and want to take the next step, you can try saying something like, \"Hey, I really enjoy spending time with you, and I was thinking it would be nice to hold hands. Would you be comfortable with that?\" This shows you respect her boundaries and care about her feelings.\n5. **Be prepared for a \"no\"**: It's essential to respect her answer, whether it's yes or no. If she declines, don't push the issue or get disappointed. Instead, focus on the quality of your conversation and the connection you're building.\n\nRemember, the goal is to be respectful, considerate, and genuine. Prioritize building a strong connection and having a positive experience with your date over the specific act of holding hands. Good luck!"

    "sentence": "He has a history of having been cheated on. I am bisexual, though this obviously doesn't mean I want to sleep with everyone and this doesn't mean either everyone wants to sleep with me. What he didn't like was that the friend who offered to go hiking offered me a while ago to go to a dancing evening with her, which I refused because dancing is pretty intimate for me. \n\nHe maybe thinks she wants either to have me date someone or date her ?? She is into boys as far as I'm aware of and the closest we have been was back in university as classmates. I think she's respectful enough of my boundaries and relationship as she didn't make a fuss out of me refusing to go dancing and offered to take a lunch out instead.\n\nI rarely go out especially on trips with friends, being very introverted I'm rarely invited and when I am I rarely say yes. Hiking sounded fine to me and an occasion to experiment what some of my friends do, going on a friend trip, and for me, getting to socialize in a safe environment with one or two friends at best. The trip was meant either for the two of us, or with another friend of uni (so we would be 3 possibly), so only people I know and not too much.\n\nTLDR : my boyfriend feels uneasy with the idea of me going hiking on a weekend alone with one or two female ex-uni classmates. Possibly because he fears I would hit on them or they would hit on me, or make me meet someone else?? How can I reassure him on that matter ?\n\nEDIT: I didn't think there would be so many answers. That's a bit overwhelming to be honest so I can't answer everyone but thanks a lot to each of you. \nBy the way, my friend wanted me to go dancing so I would go with her, not dance with her. She is not interested in me, nor am I in her. If there had been any risk, I wouldn't have been so frustrated by my boyfriend's reaction. I will try and have an open talk with him about this specific issue and hopefully get him start therapy for real.\nThank you very much for your help and advice :)",

    "base_reply": "Thank you for the clarification. I'm glad you're considering having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that your boyfriend has trust issues given his past experiences. It's not unreasonable for him to feel uneasy about the situation. However, it's essential to address his concerns in a way that's respectful and reassuring.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for your conversation:\n\n1. Acknowledge his feelings: Start by acknowledging his feelings and validating his concerns. Let him know that you understand why he might feel uneasy and that you're willing to work through this together.\n2. Reiterate your commitment: Reassure him that your commitment to him and your relationship is strong, and that you're not interested in pursuing anything with your female friends. You can say something like, \"I want to reassure you that my priority is our relationship, and I'm not interested in pursuing anything with anyone else.\"\n3. Discuss boundaries: Talk about your boundaries and what you're comfortable with in terms of socializing with friends. You can say something like, \"I understand that you might be worried about me being alone with friends, but I'm happy to set boundaries and ensure that we're all comfortable with the situation.\"\n4. Address the dancing invitation: Clarify the context of the dancing invitation and reassure him that it was just a friendly invitation, not an attempt to pursue something romantic. You can say something like, \"I want to clarify that the dancing invitation was just a friendly offer, and I didn't feel comfortable with it because it's not my thing. I wouldn't have said yes if I thought there was anything romantic involved.\"\n5. Offer compromises: Be open to finding compromises that make him feel more comfortable. For example, you could suggest inviting another friend to join you on the hike or ensuring that you're always in a public place.\n\nRemember to listen actively and empathetically to your boyfriend's concerns, and try to find a solution that works for both of you. Good luck with your conversation, and I hope it helps to strengthen your relationship!"

    "sentence": "Hi team, my (f35) husband (M39) and I have been together for 14 years and have 3 kids together.  A few years ago we hit a rough patch.  I resented him for not helping out with the kids/house.  He was stressed with the pressure of being the only one bringing in an income.  Their was a point in time that I hated him, I couldn't stand to be in the same room as him.  I wanted to leave but he insisted we went to counselling which we did.  4 years on and we're back in a really good place.  Now a few nights ago I woke up in the middle of the night, I usually just browse my phone but I couldn't find it, so I just grabbed his, searched the internet, looked at some pictures and then well I snooped.  I had no reason to snoop I shouldn't have and I was simply being nosy.  Well I checked his messages he had with an old female friend.  I know they slept together before we got together and it has never bothered me.  Everyone has a past.   So what did the messages say?  Well they were quite \"normal\" he's clearly turned to her when we were going through troubles and the texts show nothing more than a friendship and the fact that he has confided in her.  That is until one night he's asked to go over their after drinking at the pub around 12pm at night.  When she didn't respond he has then called her several times until she's sent him a strongly worded text to leave her alone and to go home to his wife and kids.\n\nI know you don't get a lot of context from reddit posts, and from the little information I've provided you probably picture a drinking, cheating Chad so I'm just asking you to trust me when I say this is very out of character for him.  He's very family oriented, rarely drinks and is very much against cheating.  Our relationship was in a bad place at the time he sent the message to this girl.  I had developed feelings for someone else (I never acted on them or pursued the person.  I avoided them completely.)  I'm also not an idiot and texting a girl at 12am when your drunk is very suspicious.  So my question is, do I confront him?  Nothing happened between the two of them as she clearly told him to back off and it's not like he outright said \"Hey babe you dtf\"  He asked if he could come over.  Could I be wrong?  Could he actually just have wanted someone to talk to?   Probably not but I need some perspective.  Should I just leave this in the past, it happened 4 years ago.\n\nTLDR; Husband had messages on his phone from 4 years ago asking if he could visit his female friend at 12 am after a few drinks at the pub.  She told him to go home to his wife and kids.\n\nUpdate in comments.\r  \nThank you to everyone who responded.  I tried to do an update post but mods wouldn't allow it. The general consensus was that I should leave this in the past which I planned on doing however it continued to play on my mind. One of the reasons our marriage ended up in a bad spot was my inability to communicate effectively. So instead of letting this simmer and the suspicion and distrust grow I decided to bring it up. It wasn't easy, as I said in the last post our marriage is doing really well now, so to bring up an accusation was not a nice feeling (I also had to admit to the snooping). I started by asking if anything had happened between him and his friend before we got together to which he said yes. I then asked if anything happened when we were having troubles in our marriage to which he said no (I'm paraphrasing, he said extra words throughout the conversation). I then had to admit that I looked through his phone and that there were messages that showed he wanted to go up there late at night. He straight away said nothing had happened between the two of them. We had a bit of back and forth where I said, I knew nothing happened because she told you to go home but it looks like you wanted to go there after you were drinking one night which is very suspicious. I think at this moment he had a bit of realization, like he now knows exactly what messages/night I'm talking about. He tells me, his friend did think he was hitting on her that night (and who can blame her) but he didn't want to see her for sex. This was the night of his work break up. He got extremely drunk (which he rarely does) was wound up and basically didn't want the party to end. Knowing that she often has drinks at her house (which is true) he wanted to go over to continue drinking. Being a drunk idiot he called and text her more than a reasonable sober person would (I think he was a bit embarrassed about this) until she told him to back off and go home.\r  \n\r  \nStill feeling uncomfortable, I asked if he wanted something to happen between them that night, that we were in a bad place and I wouldn't blame him for wanting something to happen with someone else. He looked at me like \"WTF?\" then reiterated that nothing happened, he only wanted to go over there so that he could keep drinking and that the time where our marriage was on the rocks was the worst time of his whole life. I also remember the night of his work break up because he was sick as a dog when he got home and slept outside.\r  \n\r  \nI do believe him. I know some people will think I'm foolish, that there is no possible reason for him to be calling a woman at this time of night but I believe him. Other than this one time he has never given me reason to believe he has cheated or wanted to cheat. He is not one of those people who hides his phone. We occasionally pick up each others phones to use when one of ours is flat or need the other to send a text/call/resolve a disagreement via google fact checking. He doesn't go missing after work and he'd prefer to be at home than out and about.\r  \n\r  \nHe didn't say anything regarding me looking through his phone until about 5 minutes after the issue was resolved and I quote \"I'm kind of flattered you care enough to go through my phone after all this time\". He laughed, I sheepishly laughed and apologized.",
    "human": "Hard to know if he wanted to talk or sex, some drunk people just want to rant. But, i’d say 4 years ago nothing happened he was drunk and it’s never happened again and you’re in a good place..just let it go. If it happens again now, then definitely address it, but it sounds like he was drunk and got the slap on the face reality he needed.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you decided to bring up the issue instead of letting it simmer and potentially cause more harm to your relationship. It takes a lot of courage to address something like this, especially when you're still hurt and vulnerable.\n\nFirstly, I want to commend you for acknowledging your own mistakes. Admitting to snooping and being nosy is a big step, and it shows that you're taking responsibility for your actions.\n\nNow, regarding the situation, I think it's great that you confronted your husband and had an open and honest conversation about it. It's clear that he's being truthful and transparent about his intentions, and it's good that you're giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that everyone has a past, and it's unrealistic to expect your husband to be completely immune to temptation or distraction. What's important is that he's committed to your relationship and has never acted on any desires he may have had.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that your husband's behavior, while questionable, doesn't necessarily mean he's a cheater or someone who's prone to infidelity. He's human, and he made a mistake. But he's also taking responsibility for it and has been honest with you about what happened.\n\nAs for your decision to look through his phone, I understand why you did it, but it's not ideal. Snooping can damage trust and create more problems in the long run. In the future, it might be better to communicate openly and honestly about your concerns instead of resorting to snooping.\n\nOverall, I think you're handling this situation well, and it's great that you're working through it together. Remember that relationships are about growth, communication, and trust. It's okay to make mistakes, but it's how you learn from them and move forward that matters."

Firstly, my wife and I have been married for nearly 5 years now, we love our marriage but there are certain roadblocks that we’re currently facing regarding the past that we can’t seem to move from since shes still struggling with it. Prior to us getting married, we were engaged for a very brief time (less than 4 months). We were both 21/22 at the time. During that time, I proposed to her in a very bad manner (i.e. i took her to a small park but there was no light source of any kind, so no pictures could have been taken and I rushed through my speech about wanting to be married to her - overall it was a very bad memory/ experience for her). \n\nSince we’ve been married, the memory of it comes back once in a while and she tries to move on from it but she always feels like its something shes missing out on - her first proposal. Ive suggested redoing the proposal, apologizing for the way the proposal turned out, and recreating those memories, she adamantly said it wont feel the same as a first experience since its a do over. When I asked her what she would do if roles were reversed, she said she’d do it differently, meaning there is a way to fix the memory/ experience for her but she wont tell me how. \n\nTL:DR: wife cant move forward from\nthe past regarding a proposal and doesnt want a do over, what to do?\n\nWhat should I do in this case?

Is there something specific that she's missing or wants to feel that she didn't get from the original proposal? Is there a way you can work together to create new, positive memories that don't replace the original experience but complement it?\n\nIt's also important to consider that your wife's reluctance to redo the proposal might not be about the proposal itself but about the underlying issues or emotions that are tied to it. It could be that there's something deeper going on that's causing her to hold onto this memory, and addressing that might be more important than redoing the proposal.\n\nUltimately, it's crucial to prioritize your wife's feelings and work together to find a solution that respects her boundaries and helps you both move forward."

I feel bad as from what I know of him he seem to be nice, so I try to be as nice as I can when saying no, but it just isn't working. I really don't want to be an ass since I go to college with them and have all the same classes, but this is getting really uncomfortable.",

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It can be really tough to navigate these situations, especially when you're trying to be kind and respectful.\n\nFirstly, let me say that you did the right thing by being clear and direct about your orientation. It's important to be honest and respectful, and you've done that.\n\nNow, it seems like this person isn't taking the hint, and that's not okay. Here's what I would suggest:\n\n1. Reiterate your boundaries: It's possible that this person didn't fully understand or accept your initial rejection. You can try reiterating your boundaries in a firm but polite way. You could say something like, \"Hey, I appreciate your persistence, but I want to be clear that I'm not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with you. I'm interested in women, and I'd like to respect each other's boundaries.\"\n2. Set clear consequences: If this person continues to pursue you despite your clear rejection, you need to set clear consequences. You can say something like, \"I understand that you're not giving up, but I need to be clear that I'm not interested. If you continue to pursue me, I'll have to take steps to protect my own well-being and comfort. I'd rather we focus on being friends, but if that's not possible, I'll need to re-evaluate our friendship.\"\n3. Prioritize your own comfort: It's okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. If this person is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, it's okay to take steps to distance yourself or set boundaries. Remember that you deserve to be respected and treated with kindness.\n4. Seek support: It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about what you're going through. They can offer you emotional support and help you develop a plan to deal with the situation.\n\nRemember, you didn't do anything wrong by being honest and direct. You're not obligated to engage with someone who isn't respecting your boundaries. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nAs for your concern about being an \"ass,\" I want to assure you that being honest and direct is not being an \"ass.\" It's actually being a responsible and respectful person. You're not obligated to sacrifice your own comfort and well-being for someone else's feelings. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your choices."

I put a bit too much money and time into equipment for a certain sport and I feel obligated to keep playing it even though I'm not exactly enjoying it that much recently. \n\nThis also happens with other areas of my life, such as spending too much money on micro-transactions in videogames in which I struggle to quit the game.",

The day of the concert comes and it's raining (but they're not cancelling the show), and on top of that, you're already getting sick. You know that if you go out in the rainy concert you will not only have a horrible time, but make yourself even sicker. Yet, you paid good money for the tickets, can't scalp them, and can't get your money back. So you feel obligated to go, even though you are guaranteed to have a worse time than you would if you stayed home. \n\nThe money paid for the tickets at this point is a sunk cost - it won't change no matter what happens. Yet the more logical decision for your current and future well-being (to stay home), is trumped by the more emotional decision to go because you're invested now, and you don't want to waste that investment. Maybe you also told your friends/family how excited you were to be going to the show, so on top of your financial investment you also have an emotional/social investment in going as well.",

Here's the thing: it's okay to acknowledge that sometimes we make mistakes or misjudgments, and it's better to cut our losses and move on.\n\nFirst, take a step back and honestly assess your feelings about the sport. Are you doing it because you genuinely enjoy it, or are you doing it out of obligation or fear of waste? Be honest with yourself – it's okay if the answer is the latter.\n\nNext, consider the opportunity cost. Are there other activities or hobbies that you've been putting off or wanting to try, but haven't had the time or energy for? How might your time and resources be better spent on those pursuits?\n\nRegarding the videogames, it's not uncommon for microtransactions to suck us in. It's a clever design tactic, after all! But if you're struggling to quit, ask yourself: what's the real value you're getting out of the game? Is it the social aspect, the sense of accomplishment, or something else? Can you find those same benefits in other games or activities?\n\nHere's a strategy that might help: set a specific deadline for yourself to reassess your involvement in the sport or game. For example, you could say, \"I'll give myself six months to get back into enjoying this sport/game, and if I'm still not feeling it, I'll take a break or quit altogether.\" Having a clear endpoint can help you stay focused and motivated.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to make mistakes and adjust course. You're not defined by your past investments or decisions. You can always learn from them and use that knowledge to make better choices moving forward.\n\nRemember, it's not about being a quitter or a failure; it's about being honest with yourself and making decisions that align with your current values and priorities."

Especially not when the safety and wellbeing of myself and those I care about is up in the air.\n\nIs there nothing to it but to find out when the day comes, and maybe gain practice through application? Are certain types of people predisposed to being better at that sort of thing?\n\nUltimately, any LPT's for being able to mentally and emotionally handle the sort of serious situation that would require quick action to resolve?",

    "base_reply": "The importance of crisis preparedness! It's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to be better equipped to handle challenging situations. While it's true that you can't fully prepare for every eventuality, there are indeed steps you can take to increase your resilience and preparedness.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that crisis preparedness is not just about reacting to immediate situations, but also about building a foundation of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and coping skills. Here are some LPTs to help you get started:\n\n1. **Develop emotional intelligence**: Cultivate self-awareness by recognizing your emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. This will help you better understand your reactions and responses to stressors. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or journaling to increase your emotional intelligence.\n2. **Build a support network**: Surround yourself with people who can offer emotional support, guidance, and resources during challenging times. Nurture these relationships and maintain open communication channels.\n3. **Practice crisis simulation exercises**: Engage in scenario-based training or role-playing exercises with trusted friends or family members. This can help you develop problem-solving skills, think critically, and practice decision-making under pressure.\n4. **Stay informed and educated**: Stay up-to-date on relevant topics, such as crisis management, emergency response, and mental health resources. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.\n5. **Develop a crisis plan**: Create a plan for common scenarios, such as natural disasters, power outages, or medical emergencies. This can include having an emergency fund, a communication plan, and a backup plan for essential services.\n6. **Cultivate a growth mindset**: Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. View failures or setbacks as chances to improve and develop new skills.\n7. **Prioritize self-care**: Take care of your physical and mental health by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n8. **Stay adaptable and flexible**: Be prepared to pivot and adjust your plans as circumstances change. Remain open to new information, and be willing to learn from mistakes.\n9. **Practice gratitude and positivity**: Focus on the good things in your life, and cultivate a positive outlook. This can help you stay resilient in the face of challenges.\n10. **Seek professional help when needed**: Don't hesitate to seek professional help if you're struggling with mental health issues, trauma, or other challenges. A mental health professional can provide you with personalized guidance and support.\n\nAs for whether certain types of people are more predisposed to handling crises, research suggests that individuals with certain personality traits, such as:\n\n* Emotional stability\n* Conscientiousness\n* Openness to experience\n* Agreeableness\n* Extraversion\n\nmay be more likely to handle crises effectively. However, it's essential to remember that crisis preparedness is not solely dependent on personality traits. By developing the skills and strategies mentioned above, anyone can improve their ability to handle challenging situations.\n\nRemember, crisis preparedness is an ongoing process that requires effort, practice, and self-reflection. By focusing on building your emotional intelligence, support network, and crisis preparedness skills, you'll be better equipped to handle whatever life throws your way."

    "sentence": "My girlfriend doesn't think I'm making enough progress in therapy and tells me I need to explore alternative therapies, most of which aren't evidence based. I'm in therapy and my therapist tells me I have all the symptoms of PTSD. I was raised by a bunch of really angry abusive women (aunts and grandmother) who all had a problem with men/boys, because my uncle was an abusive piece of shit to everyone in the family ... and he was that way because my grandfather was that way. They basically were afraid that I would turn out like my uncle, so they singled me out as a \"problem child\" and spent my whole childhood trying to \"fix\" me in very unhealthy ways. I internalized the notion that I was \"wrong\" and essentially I didn't ever stick up for myself and that extended into my marriage which lasted ten years and spectacularly imploded upon itself.\n\nShe has ADHD, and most of our conflict revolves around her forgetting to do things or just being really bad at time management. Everything I've learned in therapy is that when dealing with a person who's struggling like this, you just talk about how the other person's actions made you feel and work towards a compromise that works for both of you. When things don't go well, I try to be very solution focused. For example, one thing that has been a big problem for us is that we will end up ungodly late for things. If we have plans with friends at 7:00, there have been times we'll be leaving the house at 9:30. I try to tell her things like, \"Hey that really is frustrating, can we try doing X or Y differently in the future?\" and her response is to tell me that I shouldn't be upset, she has \"time blindness\", \"lacks the spoons\" etc. I tell her, \"Sure that's understandable, you had a long day. That doesn't mean I can't be upset/frustrated/annoyed that we're flaking on friends I want to see. How about next time if you really are 'lacking the spoons' just tell me you can't go and I'll hang out with my friends on my own and say you got sick? Or take the time you need and catch an Uber over there later? What happened here was that I spent two hours waiting for you to wrap up 'just another twenty minutes' of work, I didn't get to see my friends, and I could have spend this time unwinding and playing video games or something. Instead, I sat on the sofa for 2 hours in a lurch wondering if we were ever going to leave the house. That hurts my feelings, really makes me upset, and frustrates me.\"\n\nRather than empathize or take accountability for how things like that really hurt my feelings, she's determined that the reason I get hurt so frequently is that I'm not working hard enough in therapy. She's gotten deep into new age therapy and tells me things like I need to hack my consciousness and shift my energy. She tells me I need more water and less fire energy. It's all a big cryptic lexicon I don't understand and frankly I don't want to understand. It just feels like invalidation with extra steps because she seems to be the most upset that I tell her my feelings (eg I'm frustrated we're 3 hours late) and offer up alternatives (let's just cancel, so I can have a night to myself). I feel like these are very reasonable things if she really is too beat from the workday to go and be social. She's resorted to now telling me that my therapy isn't working \"fast enough.\" She tells me that I need to come up to her level because she's that much more evolved and emotionally mature. We had a big fight last night where I reiterated over and over that I need her to let me work on my trauma with my therapist on my own terms. Two pamphlets for \"holistic therapy\" show up on my desk. She sent me an gmail calendar invite for and \"Energy Healing Workshop\" that costs $300. She said she would pay for it if I could just \"try it.\"\n\n**tl;dr:** My girlfriend is big into new-age alternative therapy. She insists I pursue that instead of my trauma treatment with my regular therapist. She refuses to let me say no to this and keeps pushing the boundaries I have set.",

It's not okay for her to minimize your emotions and tell you that you're not doing enough in therapy. It's also concerning that she's pushing you to try alternative therapies that may not be evidence-based or suitable for your specific needs.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that you're in therapy for your own healing and growth, not to impress or appease someone else. Your therapist has diagnosed you with PTSD, which is a serious condition that requires professional treatment. It's essential to prioritize your trauma treatment and not compromise on it.\n\nRegarding your girlfriend's behavior, it's possible that she's struggling with her own emotional regulation and stress management due to her ADHD. However, that's not an excuse for invalidating your feelings or pushing you to do something that doesn't feel right for you.\n\nHere's a suggestion: have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how her behavior is affecting you. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, you could say:\n\n\"I feel hurt and frustrated when you dismiss my feelings and tell me I'm not doing enough in therapy. I feel like you're not taking my trauma seriously and that it's not okay for you to push me to try alternative therapies that I'm not comfortable with. I need you to understand that my therapy is important to me, and I need your support and respect for my boundaries.\"\n\nIt's also essential to set clear boundaries and communicate them assertively. You can say something like:\n\n\"I appreciate your enthusiasm for these alternative therapies, but I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'm committed to my trauma treatment with my therapist, and I need your support and understanding. If you're not willing to respect my boundaries, I need to re-evaluate our relationship.\"\n\nRemember, your well-being and mental health are top priority. Don't compromise on your therapy or your emotional needs to accommodate someone else's expectations."

Judging only by the title, this may be an weird request, but I don't know how to be a good friend.\n\nQuick backstory: I didn't have any friends during my childhood, when I was in high school my classmates were dickheads and I didn't even consider them as friends. I don't like people a lot, I have trusting issues, and I don't know how to demonstrate my emotions at all (people have a hard time guessing if I'm happy or not).\n\nNow, I'm in college.

It's about building a genuine connection and showing up for the people in your life.

This will help you build stronger bonds.\n3. **Be authentic**: Don't try to be someone you're not. Share your genuine thoughts, feelings, and experiences with your friends. This will help them feel more comfortable around you and build trust.\n4. **Communicate openly**: If you're struggling with trusting issues or emotional regulation, consider opening up to your friends about it. They may be more understanding than you think, and it can help you build a deeper connection.\n5. **Don't overthink it**: Remember that friendships are not a competition or a transaction. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to be the \"best\" friend. Focus on being present and genuine, and the rest will fall into place.\n6. **Practice vulnerability**: Share your emotions, even if it's just a small step, like expressing gratitude or appreciation. This will help your friends feel more comfortable opening up to you.\n\nLastly, don't worry if you don't \"get it\" right away. Friendship is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes. The key is to be willing to learn, adapt, and grow with your friends.\n\nRemember, being a good friend is not about being perfect; it's about being present, genuine, and supportive.

I absolutely adore him, he is my best friend and I admire him as a person as much as I am completely in love with him. Yes he is younger, but he is completely gorgeous, funny, intelligent, kind, principled, interesting and unique and I want nothing more than for him to be in my life long term and to be the best girlfriend I can possibly be to him.\n\nThere is one issue though. \nHe part bought his own house (part ownership new buid scheme in the UK) in October and I have been spending a 2-3 nights a week here. I repay him by buying most household / cleaning things, buying and cooking some of our meals, cleaning and tidying most times I am round, doing general favours and trying to get him small gifts most weeks.\n\nFor the most part, I have a really good time when I am round aside from the stress that our different standards of hygiene and tidyness causes me - especially as he is really keen for me to move in and start helping him to pay off the mortgage. I am currently living back with my parents whilst undertaking teacher training. I would be so enthusiastic about the idea of having a sleepiver with my favourite person every night if it wasn’t for the state of his house.\n\nIt is a nice house in a great area, but he just does not seem to feel any need to clean it. When you walk in the floor is immediately covered in a couple of boxes of random things, letters that have been opened and chucked on the floor, toolboxes from his work as an electrician and rubbish meant for the recycling. Every room has random mess on the floor along with nails, screws, bits of wire etc. The kitchen counters are always filthy, covered in bits of food unless I have cleaned them that day and he hasn’t got round to cooking again yet.\nHe washes up when he needs the stuff but often leaves the sink a disgusting food and grease covered mess (I feel really harsh saying all this). You can’t walk from the front door to the other side of the house without the bottom of your socks becoming yellow - brown.\n\nMost rooms are a genuine health and safety hazard with the amount of random things on the floor and there are some furniture items I haven’t got round to yet that are covered in thick layers of dust and dirt, as are any skirting boards I haven’t got to. He doesn’t even clean his toilets with the cleaner and toilet brushes that I bought for him as a hint and I consequently end up literally cleaning his shit up for him every time I am round.\n\nI am ridiculously busy with my teacher training and all associated assignments and admin at the moment but it sometimes feels like one of my main hobbies outside of work is spending hours and hours washing up and cleaning for him just for it to go right back to how it was within a couple of hours. \n\nI spent over 20 hours during my last school half term holiday cleaning and tidying 3 rooms and a single table heaped with stuff. Whenever he sees my cleaning he does say thank you a lot and is very grateful but makes sure to emphasise that I don’t have to do this and he’d never expect me to. The truth is, whilst I started doing it to help him as he also works a lot, it is now more for my own comfort as I’ve realised that he just does not care and makes no effort whatsoever to maintain my work.

However, early in our relationship he made a half jokey comment about how guys need a girl in their lives otherwise they’d live in squalor. He also wants me to move in as soon as possible and can’t understand why I don’t spend more time staying at his house now. Unfortunately I am too focused on being a good teacher to have the time to follow him around with a bin and a sweeping brush. I’d also quite like to have some hobbies of my own after moving in. He thinks that I am ‘OCD’ but I promise that my bar is not high at all - I’d just quite like to live in a house that wouldn’t make me feel embarrassed to have people over in.\n\nWhat do I do in this situation without being naggy or controlling, or ending the relationship?

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and frustration with your boyfriend's living habits. It's not fair to expect you to constantly clean up after him, especially when you're already busy with your teacher training. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend: Instead of accusing him of being lazy or uncaring, approach the conversation as a concern for your own well-being and the relationship. Express your feelings and needs in a non-judgmental way. You might say something like: \"Hey, I love spending time with you at your place, but I have to admit that the mess is really affecting my comfort and stress levels. I understand that we all have different standards, but I feel like I'm constantly cleaning up after you. I'd love it if we could find a way to compromise and find a middle ground that works for both of us.\"\n2. Set boundaries: It's essential to establish clear boundaries and expectations for your living situation. You might say something like: \"I'm happy to help with cleaning and tidying, but I need some help from you too. Could we take turns cleaning certain areas or tasks? Or maybe we can find a schedule that works for both of us?\"\n3. Don't take on too much responsibility: Remember that you're not his personal maid or cleaning service. You're a guest in his home, and it's not your responsibility to keep the entire house spotless. Be clear about what you're willing and able to do, and don't feel guilty about not doing more.\n4. Consider a compromise: If your boyfriend is unwilling to compromise or take responsibility for his living space, it might be worth considering a compromise. For example, you could suggest having a designated \"cleaning day\" where you both work together to tidy up the house. This way, you're not shouldering the entire burden, and you're both contributing to the cleaning process.\n5. Re-evaluate the relationship: If your boyfriend is unwilling to listen to your concerns or make any changes, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship. You deserve to feel comfortable and respected in your living space, and if your boyfriend is not willing to accommodate your needs, it might be a sign that the relationship is not healthy for you.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You don't have to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of the relationship."

I have the life that I've lived, and I use that to define who I am. But when looking to the future, I realised I have no values or passions that are steering me down a particular path. I just sort of exist. I am studying to get a career in a field I'm passionate about, but outside of that I feel as though I have no idea who I am, and it's recently started to make me feel very uncomfortable. \n\nIf someone were to ask me to describe who I am, all I could list is *what I do*, i.e. my job, education, living circumstances. I feel hollow and like I have nothing to distinguish me from other people.\n\nWhat are some good ways to learn more about who I am as a person without bias or influence from others?",

It's great that you're recognizing this and wanting to make a change.\n\nTo discover who you are beyond your external circumstances, I recommend exploring your inner world. Here are some exercises to help you uncover your values, passions, and unique qualities without influence from others:\n\n1. **Journaling:** Set aside 10-15 minutes each day for a week to write about:\n\t* What makes you feel alive and energized?\n\t* What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n\t* What are your thoughts and emotions on a typical day?\n\t* What do you daydream about or imagine for your future?\n2. **Self-reflection:** Schedule a solo day or weekend where you disconnect from social media, TV, and other distractions. Use this time to:\n\t* Take long walks or engage in physical activities that bring you joy.\n\t* Practice mindfulness meditation, yoga, or other mindfulness exercises to tune into your thoughts and emotions.\n\t* Engage in creative activities like drawing, painting, writing, or playing music to tap into your inner world.\n3. **Values exploration:** Ask yourself:\n\t* What's most important to you in life? (e.g., relationships, personal growth, creativity, fairness, etc.)\n\t* What are your non-negotiables? (e.g., what you won't compromise on)\n\t* What kind of person do you want to be?\n4. **Values-based decision-making:** Start making decisions based on your values. For example, if you value creativity, take on a creative project or hobby. If you value fairness, volunteer or participate in activities that promote social justice.\n5. **Experiment and exploration:** Try new activities, hobbies, and experiences that spark curiosity and excitement. You might discover new passions or interests that align with your values.\n6. **Seek out role models:** Identify people who inspire you, not because of their external achievements, but because of their values, passions, and character. Analyze what you admire about them and how you can incorporate those qualities into your own life.\n7. **Self-compassion:** Practice self-acceptance and kindness. Recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers yet. Be gentle with yourself as you explore and discover who you are.\n\nRemember, this is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Don't feel pressured to have all the answers immediately. Focus on cultivating self-awareness, and you'll gradually uncover your unique qualities, values, and passions.\n\nLastly, don't worry about what others think. You are not defined by what you do; you are so much more. Embrace your uniqueness, and the right path will unfold."

    "sentence": "I don't know what I should do about this if anything. I'm 31/f and have been dating my boyfriend (28/m) for about a year now. His grandfather is very old, can barely hear, and shuffles around. So he's harmless. But he literally does not take his eyes off of me anytime I'm in the same room as him. I'm not kidding, I have never been stared down so bad in my life. It's really uncomfortable.\n\nThe first time I met bf's grandfather was actually before we even started dating. I got invited to a party his family was throwing by bf and bf's sister. I noticed grandfather staring at me then but thought maybe he was trying to figure out who I was. At one point the grandfather came up to me and rubbed my back and asked if I was single and if I was interested in my bf (again this is before we were dating). I brushed it off as him trying to be wingman for his grandson. I told both my bf and his sister that their grandfather wouldn't stop staring at me and rubbed my back and they both kinda sympathetically brushed it off. Both similar responses to the tune of \"Yeah...sorry about that. He didn't used to be that way until he got old\"\n\nAnd now every occasion the grandfather just hardcore stares right at me the entire time. One time he came up to me and kissed me on the cheek and hugged me. My bf's mom told me that the grandfather thinks I'm very pretty. I know it's supposed to be a compliment but I guess that just confirms that he's not staring because he's happy for his grandson but he's just checking me out. But then again...he's 90 and can barely get around on his own. He probably doesn't realize he's staring like that. Is it wrong for me to be creeped out?\n\nI haven't brought it up to my bf since the original meeting. I'm not sure if I should. Would it even solve anything? Do I really want to cause drama and have someone tell the grandfather to stop staring at me? I feel like I'm being a baby about it. I also am afraid to tell my boyfriend that I'm uncomfortable because I'm not sure if I want this brought up to the family. And my boyfriend isn't the type to just not say anything. Even if I ask him not to say anything, I think he would. So what do I do? Anything? Just deal with it?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend's very very old grandfather stares me down anytime he sees me. Not sure if I should say anything or just get used to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate everyone's advice. Maybe the dementia guesses have some merit. I had decided that I would find a way to talk to my boyfriend about it but really stress that I don't want him to bring it up with family members or really take much action other than help interfere with the staring indirectly. I mostly want my bf to be aware when I'm uncomfortable...however....this morning his grandfather woke up in a shaking fit and had to go to the hospital. We think he'll be okay but it kinda made me feel guilty about talking bad about him. And obviously this isn't a good time to talk to my boyfriend while the grandfather is in the hospital. But I do think the next time I see his grandpa I will bring up the staring to my boyfriend again and get more info.",
    "human": "At risk of sounding heartless, in all likelihood, he will be dead in a few years. So assuming everything's going great with your bf apart from this one thing, I'd just suck it up until he kicks the bucket.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're considering how to approach this situation. It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable and unsure about how to handle it.\n\nFirstly, it's not wrong to feel creeped out by the grandfather's behavior. It's natural to feel uneasy when someone is staring at you in an intense and prolonged manner, regardless of their age or condition.\n\nGiven the grandfather's advanced age and potential dementia, it's possible that he's not fully aware of his behavior or its impact on you. However, it's still important to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend in a non-accusatory way. You can express your concerns to your boyfriend without blaming or criticizing the grandfather. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Choose the right time: As you mentioned, it's not a good idea to bring it up while the grandfather is in the hospital. Wait until you have a private moment with your boyfriend when you're both feeling calm and relaxed.\n2. Use \"I\" statements: Instead of saying \"he's creepy\" or \"he's staring at me,\" express your feelings using \"I\" statements. For example: \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about your grandfather. When he stares at me, I feel really uncomfortable and uneasy. I was wondering if we could find a way to make me feel more at ease around him.\"\n3. Avoid blaming or criticizing: Phrases like \"he's being creepy\" or \"he's not respecting my boundaries\" can put your boyfriend on the defensive. Instead, focus on your own feelings and experiences.\n4. Seek a solution together: Ask your boyfriend if he has any ideas on how to make you feel more comfortable around his grandfather. He may have insights or suggestions that can help.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to tolerate behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you do decide to talk to your boyfriend about the situation, it's essential to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries.\n\nAs for whether you should tell your boyfriend's family members, it's ultimately up to you. If you feel comfortable doing so, you could mention it to his sister or mother in a casual conversation. However, it's essential to approach the conversation with sensitivity and empathy, remembering that the grandfather is a family member and may not be aware of his behavior.\n\nLastly, don't beat yourself up over feeling guilty about considering talking to your boyfriend about this. Your feelings and boundaries are valid, and it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being."

I have a near paralyzing fear of dogs now, no matter how small or friendly, I freeze up near them and freak out if they touch me at all. I actually really like dogs (or at least the concept of them) but when near a real dog my body refuses to act rationally. This is something I want to overcome, does anyone know how I can?",
    "human": "Find a good dog trainer and ask him if he will help you. \n\nUnfortunately the majority of dog trainers out there are absolute garbage and it will be hard to find someone that actually knows what they are doing.\n\nIf you are in the UK I can definitely put you in touch with somebody.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you've had such a traumatic experience. It's completely understandable that you'd develop a fear response to dogs after what you went through. Overcoming a deep-seated fear takes time, patience, and a gentle, gradual approach. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you work through your fear:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and accept your fear**: Recognize that your fear is valid and not something to be ashamed of. Acknowledge the physical and emotional impact it's had on your life.\n2. **Seek professional help**: Consider consulting a therapist, such as a cognitive-behavioral therapist (CBT) or a trauma-informed therapist. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through your emotions in a safe and controlled environment.\n3. **Start with education**: Learn about dog behavior, body language, and warning signs of aggression. Understanding dogs better can help you feel more comfortable and prepared around them.\n4. **Gradual exposure**: Gradually expose yourself to dogs in a controlled environment, starting with small steps:\n\t* Begin by looking at pictures or videos of dogs, then move to watching dogs from a distance, and eventually, progress to being in the same room as a dog (but not necessarily touching or interacting).\n\t* Start with calm, well-behaved dogs, and work your way up to more energetic or larger breeds.\n\t* Consider working with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist who can help you build trust and confidence around dogs.\n5. **Relaxation techniques**: Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization, to help calm your body and mind when you're around dogs.\n6. **Desensitization**: Gradually increase your exposure to dogs while using positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats, praise, and affection. This can help your body associate dogs with positive experiences.\n7. **Reframe your thoughts**: Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive light. Instead of thinking \"I'm going to get attacked again,\" tell yourself \"I'm safe and capable of handling this situation.\"\n8. **Support system**: Surround yourself with people who understand and support your journey. Having a strong support system can make a big difference in your progress.\n9. **Patience and persistence**: Overcoming a deep-seated fear takes time. Be patient with yourself and don't push yourself too hard. Take things at your own pace, and celebrate small victories along the way.\n10. **Self-care**: Don't forget to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being. Make sure to get enough rest, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nRemember, overcoming a fear is a process, and it's okay to take things slowly. With time, patience, and the right support, you can learn to manage your fear and develop a more positive relationship with dogs."

You can say something like, \"I appreciate you sharing this with me, and I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to open up.\"\n2. **Offer a gentle redirect**: Politely steer the conversation towards a more general or neutral topic. For example, \"That's really interesting, but I'm not an expert in that area. Can we talk about something else?\"\n3. **Use a transition phrase**: If the person keeps going, use a transition phrase to subtly shift the focus away from their personal story. Try saying, \"Speaking of [related topic], have you heard about [something relevant]?\"\n4. **Be honest (but tactfully)**: If the person insists on sharing more, you can say, \"I'm happy to listen, but I want to make sure I'm not giving advice or pretending to be an expert. I'm here to support you, but I need to prioritize our conversation's direction.\"\n5. **Set a boundary**: If the person continues to push for more personal details, it's okay to say, \"I'm not comfortable discussing this topic further. Let's focus on [a more general topic].\"\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and avoid feeling guilty or obligated to engage in conversations that make you uncomfortable.

This is my throwaway account but I want to discuss something my husband and I have a bad problem with. We both suck hard at keeping up with all the mundane chores of running a house/life. I would say I am the better of the two but have plenty of room for improvement.\nWe were both raised in controlling environments where there were many demands on our time externally including school and religious obligations. Now that we are in our late 20's and have a two year old we are still flying by the seat of our pants half the time with no real schedules or plans except for those imposed by our sons needs and work. We both severely resist schedules and are big procrastinators.\nWe both desire to have a mostly organized house along with not forgetting important due dates/appointments while still having freedom for spontaneity and time with our son. Another note, my husband has bipolar II disorder and for a long time our life was in shambles. But now he is working on doing freelance web design and I work part time. We both watch our son while the other is working.\nSo I want to hear your tips. How do you take care of business?",

I'm no expert, but I've learned a few strategies that might help you and your husband get your life more organized.

This will help you build momentum and confidence.\n2. **Batch similar tasks**: Group similar tasks together, like laundry, cleaning, or errands. This can help you stay focused and make the most of your time.\n3. **Use a 'Stop Doing' list**: Identify tasks that are no longer necessary or can be delegated. This can help reduce stress and free up time for more important things.\n4. **Create a'Someday' list**: Write down tasks you'd like to accomplish, but don't need to do immediately. This can help you declutter your mind and focus on what's truly important.\n5. **Use technology to your advantage**: Explore apps like Habitica, HabitBull, or Todoist to help you stay organized and on track. You can also set reminders, alarms, and notifications to help you remember important dates and appointments.\n6. **Schedule self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can help reduce stress and increase your overall well-being.\n7. **Communicate openly**: Share your goals and struggles with your husband and work together to find solutions. Make sure to listen actively and empathetically to each other's concerns.\n8. **Prioritize**: Identify the most important tasks and focus on those first. Break them down into smaller, manageable chunks if needed.\n9. **Leave some buffer time**: Build in some extra time between tasks to account for unexpected delays or interruptions.\n10. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, adjust your routines as needed, and celebrate your successes.\n\nFor your husband's freelance work and your part-time job, consider setting aside dedicated time for each activity. This can help you maintain a better work-life balance and reduce stress.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you both and be patient with yourselves as you work through the process. It may take some experimentation to find the right balance, but with time and effort, you can develop habits that bring you more freedom and organization.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound?

He’s supposed to be leaving this month for pre deployment training and told me to pay his half for him and gave me his card info. So I guess being naive I said “will I be doing the same thing while your deployed?” To which his reply was “No, why would it be fair for me to pay rent for a place I’m not going to be living in for up to 6-9 months.” It caught me way off guard because I moved all the way to OK from NH because he told me he wanted us to live together, that’s 22 hours away. I have no family or friends down here and I even had to pay and drive a Penske truck just to get here… what am I supposed to do? I don’t want to be here all alone and I definitely don’t want to be financially responsible for an apartment that has the rent continuously increasing almost every month.

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and concerned.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your boyfriend's response is not okay.

His comment about not paying rent for a place he's not occupying is unfair and irresponsible.\n\nAs for your situation, it's common for service members to have varying arrangements when it comes to rent and living situations while deployed. However, it's crucial to remember that you're not obligated to accept this arrangement. You have every right to discuss and negotiate with your boyfriend about how you'll handle the rent during his deployment.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend: Reiterate your concerns and expectations about being financially responsible for the apartment. You can say something like, \"I understand that you're deployed, but I've made significant sacrifices to be with you, and I don't feel it's fair for me to take on the entire rent burden. Can we discuss alternative arrangements, like finding a roommate or exploring other options?\"\n2. Consider finding a roommate: If your boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, you might want to start looking for a roommate to share the financial burden. This way, you'll have some company and someone to split the rent with.\n3. Re-evaluate your priorities: As you mentioned, your friends and family think you should leave him due to his treatment. It's essential to prioritize your own well-being and consider whether this relationship is truly worth the sacrifices you're making.\n4. Seek support: Talk to other women who are dating service members or have gone through similar situations. You might find that you're not alone, and it can be helpful to share your experiences and receive advice from others who understand what you're going through.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and fairness in your relationship. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and stand up for what you deserve.\n\nPlease take care of yourself during this challenging time."

I really don’t know what to do about my situation and I don’t have anyone close to give me advice so I thought here I can maybe get some advice. I have an amazing dad who raised me since my mom passed away when I was 5 years old. He is my friend, my supporter and someone who I want to be like when I grow up. \n\nWhen my dad first introduced my step mom to me I was 10 years old and she was very nice to me and he looked so happy that we met and hoped we could get along. They got married when I was 13 and I was so happy that me and my dad had a new member in our family. I thought me and SM were getting along until I think a few months after their honeymoon she told me one morning that we just need to pretend to like each around my dad but when he is not here that I shouldn’t bother her, honestly this shattered me but I agreed cause I didn’t know what else to do.\n\nAfter that day whenever it was just me and SM she would say things to get to me and I would just not say anything. I’m introverted and don’t like confrontation so I just took it and thought overtime she would get over it but it got worse. She would talk about my height and weight and say I was funny looking version of my dad. I hoped my dad would notice but he didn’t, he actually thinks me and SM are so close and she understands me. He looks so happy with her that i maybe its worth not saying anything and giving it time.\n\nThis year my SM has started picking on me around my dad and he has either joined in or ignored it. I have voiced that what she says makes me uncomfortable and hurts but my dad says she is teasing and doesn’t mean it to hurt me. Well right now I’m at my ends and I’m scared I’m angry, frustrated at my SM and my dad. Dad was away for work and it was just me and SM at home, she had a party at home with a couple of her friends. I helped set the house up and cook dinner cause dad asked me to help out which was fine. After they ate and just hung out they were hanging out on the porch when I heard SM and her friends talk very loud outside my window while I was in my room. SM friends talked about how lucky SM was to have a nice husband and a house, when they mentioned how nice it was that I cooked for them SM told them that I was annoying and weird and she hated me and living with me and couldn’t wait till I was 18 to kick me out. I was shocked that she hated me that much but I didn’t know why? tbh I thought we were tolerating each other but to hate me I must of done something but I can’t think of what I did\n\nI’ve been kinda down since that day which was 2 weeks ago and I thought I was pass the initial feelings but at rugby training today I bursted into tears and my coach sent me home so I drove to a beach and cried I was feel so much I honestly can’t describe my emotions, I eventually fell asleep in my car, now I’m here hoping I can get advice on how to talk to my dad about it, cause I’m scared about how he will react. I don’t want my dad to be sad cause he does so much for me but I’m not strong like him, I’m really struggling.\n\nMy question is, How can I approach this conversation with my dad about my SM hating me?

Choose the right time: Try to have the conversation when your dad is in a calm and relaxed state, away from SM's influence. You might want to wait until Sunday, as you've planned.\n2. Be honest and clear: Share your feelings and experiences with your dad, using \"I\" statements to describe how you feel. Avoid blaming or accusing language, as this can lead to defensiveness.\n3. Focus on your feelings: Instead of focusing on what SM said, focus on how it made you feel. Explain how her words and behavior have affected you, and how it's impacting your relationship with her.\n4. Seek support: Let your dad know that you're seeking support and guidance from him. You're not asking him to take sides, but rather to help you navigate the situation.\n5. Be prepared for different reactions: Your dad might be shocked, upset, or even defensive. Be patient and empathetic, and try to understand his perspective as well.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. You have a support system here, and we're all rooting for you.

Here are some tips that might help:\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to not be able to \"fix\" the issue. Sometimes, all your partner needs is someone to be present and understanding. So, prioritize being a good listener and validate their feelings. Ask open-ended questions like \"How are you feeling?\" or \"What's going on that's making you feel this way?\" to show you're actively listening.\n\nWhen it comes to physical comfort, try to be gentle and subtle. Instead of trying to scratch her back, which can be awkward, you could offer to give her a gentle massage or hold her hand. Sometimes, just having someone's physical presence can be comforting. If she's not up for a full-on massage, you could try doing some light, soothing touch like stroking her hair or giving her a gentle hug.\n\nIt's also important to respect her boundaries. If she's not feeling like eating, don't push the issue. Instead, offer to make her favorite comfort drink or snack, even if it's just a cup of tea or some toast. Sometimes, small gestures like that can go a long way in showing you care.\n\nAs for dealing with her \"spiciness,\" remember that people are more irritable when they're not feeling well. Try not to take it personally and avoid getting defensive. Instead, acknowledge her frustration and let her know you're there for her. You could say something like, \"I know you're not feeling well and that can be really frustrating. I'm here for you and I'm not going anywhere. Let me see if there's anything I can do to help.\"\n\nFinally, take care of yourself too. It's easy to get caught up in trying to care for your partner when they're not feeling well, but don't forget to prioritize your own well-being. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and taking some time for yourself. That way, you'll be better equipped to support your partner when they need you.\n\nI hope these tips help, my friend! Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it."

I'm 22 going on 23, just got out of a two year relationship with someone I love very dearly still, going on salary making about 45k in a month (if I pass a test), struggling with living arrangements (essentially out of my car and on my parents couch for a while), have over 10k in medical debt that I need to pay off, and simply being this age in general. \n\nI currently feel as though I'm drowning with everything happening and not knowing what I'm doing, with the added emotional stress it's making it very difficult. \n\nFor those of you that have surpassed this age and similar (or not similar) hardships, how do you manage yourself to make sure you don't end up somewhere awful? My boss has told me to put everything into pieces and take one at a time, and I'm trying, but they all still feel too heavy. \n\nBasically: how do you do everything when you don't know what you're doing?",
    "human": "Yeah, that's pretty much how it goes.\n\nAs you've been told, compartmentalize things. Don't try to visualize or fix all your problems at once. And that's hard to do when someone has just told you not to.\n\nRealize that everyone you meet has gone through the same level of shit at one point or another and they are still holding it together, so so can you.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through a tough time. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and I'm here to offer some guidance.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that you're not alone in this. Many people your age face similar struggles, and it's okay to not have it all figured out. It's a time of exploration, growth, and learning.\n\nTo break it down, let's tackle each issue:\n\n1. **Emotional support**: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist for emotional support. Sharing your feelings with someone who cares can help you process and gain perspective.\n2. **Living arrangements**: For now, focus on finding a temporary solution. You can look into short-term rentals, hostels, or even consider moving back in with your parents temporarily. It's not ideal, but it's a temporary fix. You can also start saving for a security deposit and looking for a more permanent place.\n3. **Medical debt**: Create a plan to tackle it. Prioritize your debts, and consider consolidating or negotiating with your creditors. You can also explore financial assistance programs or non-profit organizations that help with medical debt.\n4. **Career growth**: Focus on your job and take small steps towards advancement. Set specific, achievable goals for yourself, and work towards them. This will help you feel more in control and build confidence.\n5. **General overwhelm**: Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Set a timer for 25-minute increments, and take 5-minute breaks in between. This technique is called the Pomodoro Technique. It can help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n6. **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy, even if it's just 15-20 minutes a day. This could be reading, taking a walk, or practicing yoga. Self-care is essential for maintaining mental well-being.\n7. **Forgiveness and acceptance**: Allow yourself to feel your emotions, but also practice forgiveness. Forgive yourself for not having it all together, and acknowledge that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nTo manage your anxiety and uncertainty, try these additional strategies:\n\n* Practice mindfulness: Focus on the present moment, and acknowledge your thoughts without judgment.\n* Reframe your thoughts: Instead of thinking \"I'll never get out of this,\" try reframing it to \"I'm doing the best I can, and I'll get through this.\"\n* Celebrate small wins: Acknowledge and celebrate your small accomplishments, even if they seem insignificant.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and you're not a failure. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself throughout the process.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to not know what you're doing. It's a normal part of life, and it's an opportunity to learn and grow. You'll figure it out, and you'll come out stronger on the other side."

Getting over someone can be tough, but with time, self-care, and a willingness to heal, you can move forward.\n\nThe \"easiest\" or \"fastest\" way to get over someone is subjective and depends on individual circumstances. However, here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to grieve**: It's essential to acknowledge the loss of the relationship and the unrequited feelings. Permit yourself to feel the emotions, even if it's painful. Recognize that it's okay to grieve the loss of what could have been.\n2. **Practice self-care**: Focus on your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. A healthy body and mind can help you cope with the emotional pain.\n3. **Create distance**: Take a break from social media, avoid places you associate with your ex, and limit communication (if possible). This can help you detach and move forward.\n4. **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your emotions with someone you trust can help you process and gain new perspectives.\n5. **Find healthy distractions**: Engage in hobbies, learn a new skill, or take on a new project to shift your focus away from the person. This can help you build confidence and create a sense of accomplishment.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself as you navigate this challenging time. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can.\n7. **Focus on the present**: Instead of dwelling on what could have been, focus on the present moment. Set goals, make plans, and work towards a brighter future.\n8. **Give yourself time**: Healing takes time, so be patient with yourself. Don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over\" someone by a certain time. Allow yourself to heal at your own pace.\n9. **Create new routines**: Breakups can disrupt your daily routine. Try new things, like trying a new workout class, taking a different route to work, or trying a new hobby. This can help you create a sense of normalcy and move forward.\n10. **Remember that it's okay to not be okay**: It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time to heal. Acknowledge your feelings, and don't rush the process.\n\nRemember, everyone's healing process is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Be gentle with yourself, and focus on becoming the best version of yourself."

He is on the spectrum and for a long time I thought the neurodivergent traits all pertained to things that I could compromise on, such as a lack of sexual and romantic interest. I felt like I loved him enough to see past what he couldn't give me in these departments. We were best friends and an inseparable team. We have a home together and have relied on each other for everything. Neither of us have many friends. In the last month I've had what I would call some sort of emotional awakening. I've realized that I felt rejected every day. I was using social media and shopping as outlets to feel attractive for a very long time.\nOur communication is lacking and our conflict resolution is very poor. I will frustrate him and he'll throw something (nowhere directed at me) or bash his head into a wall. He'll say things he didn't mean, \"it is too exhausting for me to try to put any more effort into our relationship\", ect. I've asked him to change this and it never has happened. Yesterday I confessed how I felt and the problems I've had, that I don't feel like he's ever been in love with me. The relationship has felt distant for a time, so I don't think this was a shock. He was pushing me to \"rip the bandaid off\", so I just did. He packed a bag and left last night. I miss him so much and it hurts so damn badly. I feel so selfish and cruel. I know I'm not responsible for his emotions, but knowing I hurt him is ripping my heart in half. I know I'm everything to him and he would do anything for me. He's tried so hard to give me a good life. Please can someone give me some insight? \n\n\nTl;dr: I am having doubts about my decision to end my relationship just because of lack of sex, romance, and because of anger issues.

    "human": "I was married for 10 years (together 14) to someone who is on the spectrum. Being on the spectrum is not an excuse to be emotionally neglectful, narcissistic, or manipulative. There are lots of people on the spectrum who have healthy relationships because they are willing to put in effort to make their partner feel valued and to have a connection that works for both people. \n\nYou are waking up from walking through a life where you have not been having your needs met. You are not cruel. As for being selfish, why is that always seen as a bad thing? Like, you shouldn't be over-the-top only caring about yourself, but if you are not happy and healthy mentally, what is the point of life at all? You deserve better than just making it. You deserve someone who doesn't abuse you, frighten you by throwing things at you, or tell you that you are too much work. So much more. \n\nYou can love someone and still leave a relationship. Love is not enough when the other elements in play are hurtful and damaging. It's going to hurt for a while, in fact in the beginning you may find yourself having 6 bad days and 1 good day. But in time, the scale will tip. You will find that one day you realize you're having 6 good days and 1 bad. You will heal. You will find yourself. And you will be 100% better off.

It's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being, and it's okay to acknowledge that your husband's behavior has caused you harm. You deserve to be treated with respect, care, and understanding in a relationship.\n\nRegarding your doubts about ending the relationship, it's natural to question whether you made the right decision. It's clear that you love your husband deeply and value the life you've built together. However, it's crucial to consider whether the relationship is sustainable and healthy for you in the long run. You can't pour from an empty cup, and it seems like you've been putting your emotional energy into the relationship without getting the same level of emotional return.\n\nThe anger issues and lack of intimacy are significant concerns. While it's admirable that you've tried to accommodate your husband's neurodivergent traits, it's not fair to expect you to constantly compromise and sacrifice your own needs. The fact that he's never addressed your concerns or made efforts to change suggests that he may not be invested in the relationship in the same way you are.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you can't change your husband, and it's not your responsibility to fix him.

It's okay to grieve the loss of the relationship, but also acknowledge that you deserve better. You deserve a partnership where you feel seen, heard, and valued. It may take time, but you can learn to love and care for yourself again.\n\nRemember that you're not alone. There are people who understand and can offer support.

It's a natural response to uncertainty. Now, let's work on building your confidence.\n\nFor starters, instead of focusing on \"pretending\" to be confident, try to focus on what you can control – your preparation and attitude. Make sure you're well-prepared for those serving jobs by researching the companies, practicing your responses to common interview questions, and being ready to talk about your skills and experiences.\n\nWhen it comes to body language, instead of trying to \"fake\" confidence, try to focus on relaxed, open, and engaged body language. Instead of crossing your arms, try keeping your hands loose by your sides or lightly clasped in front of you. Keep your shoulders relaxed and down, rather than trying to push them back. You can also try to focus on your breathing, taking slow and deep breaths to calm your nerves.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. When you're in an interview, try to recall specific times when you've excelled in a role or situation. This can help shift your focus from how you're feeling to what you've achieved.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a normal part of the learning process.

Especially since it is a decent amount more than I am currently paying. How do we decide how much rent I pay? Does this include his strata fees? He was thinking half of his strata and mortgage payments. Or 80% of that half. Which is still more than I am paying now. How do we come to a fair agreement?\n\nTl;Dr summary. How much rent do I pay my boyfriend for living at his apartment that he already owns?",

    "base_reply": "Congratulations on being thoughtful about this decision! It's great that you're considering fairness and communication. Here's a nuanced approach to help you and your boyfriend come to a mutually beneficial agreement:\n\n1. Calculate the total monthly costs: Start by adding up his mortgage, strata fees, and other expenses (like property taxes, insurance, and maintenance) to get the total monthly cost of owning the apartment.\n2. Assess your financial situation: Consider your income, expenses, and goals. Since you're going back to school, you might want to prioritize saving for education expenses or building an emergency fund.\n3. Discuss your expectations: Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns regarding the mortgage payments. Explain that you understand he owns the apartment, but you feel it's unfair to pay half of the mortgage, especially since it's a significant amount.\n4. Explore alternative solutions:\n\t* Consider a 60/40 or 70/30 split, where you contribute a smaller percentage of the mortgage payment, but still a significant amount. This way, you're sharing the burden, but not shouldering the entire cost.\n\t* You could also propose a \"rent\" amount that's based on your individual income or a percentage of his income. For example, you could offer to pay 25-30% of his income towards the rent.\n5. Include strata fees: If you're not sure how to split strata fees, you could propose a flat rate or a percentage of the total strata fee. For example, you could offer to pay a flat $100-$200 per month or 50% of the strata fee.\n6. Consider a trial period: Suggest a trial period (e.g., 6-12 months) where you both agree to a temporary arrangement, and then re-evaluate and adjust as needed.\n7. Be prepared to compromise: Remember that compromise is key in any relationship. Be open to finding a middle ground that works for both of you.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's say the total monthly costs of the apartment are $3,500 (mortgage, strata fees, etc.). You could propose:\n\n* Paying $1,500 (around 43% of the total cost) towards the mortgage and strata fees, with the remaining $2,000 covered by your boyfriend.\n* Alternatively, you could offer to pay a flat $1,000 per month, which is a significant contribution, but not the full 50%.\n\nRemember to prioritize open communication and mutual understanding. It's essential to find a solution that works for both of you in the long run."

    "sentence": "So, I've (28)  been dating my partner (29)  for about four and a half years. We've decided that it's permanent. They are a generous, thoughtful, well-adjusted human, and I'm grateful that they want to spend their life with me like I want to spend my life with them. Cool cool. Everything good so far. Well, their sister is a disaster. She had a child at 15, she's rarely in the child's life, and my partner's parents are raising him (4M). Father of the child is unknown. Now the child is awesome, he's smart and he's funny and he's super fun to be around. I love seeing him whenever we go over to his parents' (usually once every week or two). However, my partner's parents are pretty old, and they can't raise my partner's nephew long term. We've known this for a long time, and we offered to step in years ago. They kept raising him because they really wanted to give my partner's sister every chance to be in her son's life, and I think that's appropriate. I don't think she's evil, she was just so young, and she wasn't really up for being a parent then, and it's only gotten worse now.\n\nBut the thing is, now we've signed paperwork for passing on guardianship to us in the case of my partner's parents' death. We agreed (I think appropriately) to continue giving my partner's sister every possible chance to step up, even after we assume care because that's what's best  for her, and that's what's best for her child. And we've made a timeline to transfer guardianship in the next two years after my partner and I are out of school (assuming there isn't an eleventh hour miracle and his mom actually steps up to the plate).\n\nSo now it feels really fucking real that we're going to assume care of  what will be a 6 year old in two years. A child whose mom is going to be real hostile about the fact that we would be in charge of her child, not her. A child who is going to have wants and dreams and goals and has to go to a good school, and is going to need us all of the time, including weekend mornings. Now don't get me wrong, I signed up for this, my partner signed up for this, and we're absolutely going to do it because it's the right thing to do and we love the kid. I'm not complaining. But jesus christ this is terrifying. And I won't lie, I'm sad for all the things we're never going to be able to do again. Like we can't just fuck off to another city over a weekend because we feel like it. We won't be able to buy a shoebox condo right downtown in our city around all the bars and museums and fun stuff, because we're going to need space for another human. I'm not even sure how we'll hang out with all our friends who don't have kids, and to be clear, almost none of them have kids. I'm committed to doing what is right for this child, I've known him since he was born and we're not letting him slip through the cracks, I'm just struggling to wrap my head around all the things we're going to have to give up to do the right thing here. And none of it is the child's fault, and I don't ever want to treat him like he's at fault, because OBVIOUSLY he was dragged into this much more unwillingly than we were. But I'm still feeling like I'm taking on a huge responsibility that I and my partner did not create.\n\nSo, how do I make sure I never treat this child like a burden, how do I grieve the life that I'm never going to have, how do I give the child's mom (who is honestly a child herself) love and space to grow into a role that she might never be ready for, how do I get used to the idea of being a parent, and all the renegotiations and changes that this will bring to my relationship with my partner?\n\nTL;DR My partner and I are going to assume guardianship for their nephew in two years.

It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to wrap your head around the changes that are coming. It's natural to grieve the life you had envisioned for yourself and to worry about the impact this will have on your relationship with your partner.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging your feelings is a huge step. It's essential to recognize that it's okay to feel scared, anxious, and sad. It's normal to wonder how you'll adapt to this new role and what sacrifices you'll have to make.\n\nTo ensure you don't treat the child like a burden, I recommend focusing on building a strong, loving relationship with him. Spend quality time with him, engage in activities he enjoys, and show genuine interest in his life. This will help you develop a deeper connection and appreciation for him as an individual.\n\nRegarding grieving the life you'll never have, it's crucial to acknowledge and validate your feelings. You can't control the circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. Allow yourself to process your emotions, and don't be afraid to talk to your partner about your concerns and fears. They're going through this journey with you, and sharing your feelings can bring you closer together.\n\nIt's also essential to have open and honest conversations with your partner's sister. While she may not be ready to take on the role of a mother, it's crucial to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with her. Be understanding, empathetic, and patient, but also set clear boundaries and expectations. Remember, you're not trying to replace her as a parent, but rather provide a stable and loving environment for her child.\n\nTo get used to the idea of being a parent, I recommend taking small steps. Start by taking on small responsibilities, like helping with childcare or running errands for the child's parents. This will give you a taste of what's to come and help you build confidence in your ability to care for the child.\n\nIn terms of renegotiating and changing your relationship with your partner, it's essential to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and concerns. Discuss how you'll balance your individual desires and goals with your new responsibilities as co-parents. Be willing to compromise and adapt to the new dynamics, and prioritize your relationship as a team.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help and support. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for guidance and reassurance. You're not alone in this journey, and many people have successfully navigated similar challenges.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself, and don't put too much pressure on yourself to be perfect. You're about to become a co-parent, and it's a learning process. Take it one step at a time, and focus on building a strong foundation for your new role."

With my family, I feel inundated with paperwork of all kinds and am trying to come up with a good system to manage it all.

Some items I need to keep and later discard, and still others are papers I need to keep filed away but easily accessible for future reference.\n\nSome examples of the various types of paperwork I'm trying to manage:\n\n* doctor bills and other one-off bills (regular bills are auto-paid)\n* reference paperwork from kids' schools (handbooks, calendars, list of students in class, class schedules)\n* upcoming events from kids' schools\n* kids' homework and artwork\n* vehicle recall notices - just got one today for an item that isn't urgent, but I don't want to forget about it and may not be able to bring the vehicle for a while due to general busy-ness\n* receipts, both for large purchases, and for smaller purchases that I may need for returning defective items but eventually can discard\n* receipts for eventual FSA filing\n* instruction manuals\n* service contracts and agreements\n* house and car insurance details\n* medical, dental, and vision records\n* bank and cr",

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Managing paperwork can be overwhelming, especially when you have a lot of different types of documents to keep track of. Here's a system that might help you get on top of it all:\n\n**Step 1: Categorize and Purge**\n\nStart by sorting your paperwork into categories. You can use the following categories as a starting point:\n\n* Bills to pay\n* Documents to file\n* Receipts to keep\n* Reference materials\n* Items to follow up on\n* Items to discard\n\nGo through each category and get rid of any unnecessary documents. For example, if you have a receipt for a purchase you're not going to return, you can probably toss it.\n\n**Step 2: Designate a Home for Each Category**\n\nAssign a specific spot in your home for each category. This could be a file cabinet, a drawer, or even a specific folder on your computer. Make sure it's a place where you can easily access the documents you need.\n\n**Step 3: Create a System for Organizing Documents**\n\nWithin each category, create a sub-system for organizing the documents. For example:\n\n* For bills to pay, you could use a bill organizer or a spreadsheet to keep track of due dates and payment amounts.\n* For documents to file, you could use a file cabinet or a digital file folder with labeled subfolders.\n* For receipts, you could use a receipt organizer or a digital receipt storage app.\n\n**Step 4: Set Reminders and Follow Up**\n\nSet reminders for any documents that have specific deadlines or follow-up requirements. For example, if you have a bill that's due in a few days, set a reminder to pay it. If you have a vehicle recall notice, set a reminder to schedule an appointment to get the repair done.\n\n**Step 5: Review and Maintain Your System Regularly**\n\nSchedule regular review sessions (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) to maintain your system. Go through each category and make sure everything is up to date and organized. This will help you stay on top of your paperwork and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Consider scanning and digitizing your documents to free up physical storage space and make them easier to access.\n* Use a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox to store and share files with family members or service providers.\n* Consider using a password manager to keep track of login credentials for online accounts and services.\n* Set up automatic reminders for recurring tasks, such as bill payments or appointment scheduling.\n\nBy implementing these steps, you should be able to create a system that helps you manage your paperwork effectively and reduces your stress levels."

Today for Christmas I felt kinda hurt and look at her a different way, I’m not ungrateful and I really do love this girl but the Christmas gifts I received today really hurt my feelings. So to start the story a little over a month ago I bought her Christmas gift early which was a new iPad since we was long distance during the time and didn’t know we would be back together for Christmas. I admit I’m a very difficult person to get gifts for she asked me what I wanted and I said just money so we can save and anime movies. Today I received some ankle socks, blanket, and some white T-shirt’s and that’s it’s. In total I spent 600 on iPad and in total for her maybe 100 if even that. This whole situation kinda made me feel sick I would atleast expected a Giftcard to my favorite food place but no.

However, before we dive into the idea of leaving your girlfriend, let's take a step back and explore this feeling of hurt and frustration.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you did put in effort and bought a thoughtful gift for your girlfriend. It's great that you considered her needs and wants, and the iPad was a thoughtful gesture.\n\nNow, let's talk about the gifts you received. While it's true that they might not be what you were expecting, it's possible that your girlfriend didn't know what to get you or might not have had the same level of budget. It's also possible that she was trying to get you something more personal and meaningful, even if it didn't meet your expectations.\n\nBefore jumping to conclusions or considering leaving your girlfriend, I'd like to ask you to take a closer look at your own expectations and what you're looking for in a relationship. Are you seeking a specific level of material gifts or are you looking for emotional connection and effort? Are you willing to communicate your feelings and expectations with your girlfriend, or are you letting this incident build up resentment?\n\nLastly, have you talked to your girlfriend about how you're feeling? Sometimes, misunderstandings can arise from lack of communication. If you're feeling hurt and frustrated, it's essential to express your emotions and concerns with your girlfriend. This might lead to a more open and honest conversation about your expectations and feelings.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and understanding. It's essential to approach this situation with empathy and an open mind. What do you think is the root cause of your hurt and frustration, and how do you plan to address it with your girlfriend?"

However, my sister refuses to pay back the full amount rn. My mom has tried everything, and now they can't speak together without screaming at eachother. \nMy mom wants me to go to my sister, demand she pay back the money, or my mom will take it to the court of bailiffs.

I'm not going to tell you to take sides or do what your mom wants, because that's not the most constructive approach. Instead, let's break down the situation and explore some options that prioritize long-term relationships and well-being.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your mom and sister have a deep-seated issue that goes beyond the money. It's likely a complex web of emotions, unmet expectations, and unresolved conflicts. Your mom's request to take sides is, in part, a reflection of her own pain and frustration.\n\nHere's a suggestion: consider having an open and honest conversation with both your mom and sister, focusing on the underlying issues rather than just the money. Ask them to share their perspectives, feelings, and concerns. This might be a challenging conversation, but it could lead to a deeper understanding and potentially even a resolution.\n\nIf that's not possible, you could try mediating the conversation or encouraging them to seek professional help, such as a therapist or mediator. This might help them work through their issues and find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nRegarding the money, you could suggest a compromise, such as a payment plan or a settlement that's acceptable to both parties. This might not be the ideal outcome, but it could be a more constructive approach than taking sides or pursuing legal action.\n\nLastly, remember that your relationships with your sister and mom are important, but they're not the only ones. Consider the impact on your nieces and nephews, who may be affected by the tension and conflict. You have a responsibility to prioritize their well-being and maintain a positive relationship with your sister, even if it means not taking sides.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but I hope these suggestions help you navigate this complex situation with empathy, understanding, and a focus on long-term relationships."

Our relationship was fulfilling, we had 99% in common including all hobbies and I thought we will be together for the next 50 years and we even talked about marriage... then the shock came.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks my boyfriend has been acting weird - coming home late, refusing to share pictures with me on socials and all of sudden was acting generally pissed at me. I suspected something was wrong and confronted him. He basically started gaslighting me that I am only imagining things and act mean to him when I am asking what is wrong. Then I found out from my friends that he has hidden our relationship from all social media. And then that he met some younger girl he wants to try dating. And that he was telling his friends he plans to leave me this weekend for 2 weeks. My whole world was destroyed at that moment.\n\nThe final confrontation was weird. He didn't want to admit anything. He was claiming how he still loves me and nothing happened yet and that he doesn't want to throw away our relationship. So we spent a night and a morning together. Did things as usual. Planned the next two days. We even discussed what went wrong. My bf was still telling me how much he loves me and that I should not worry. That he wants to be with me and we will sort it out. \n\nThen I went to make an errand. My bf basically packed most of his stuff and left. He claimed he went grocery shopping and even texted me about what to buy. When I returned I was in shock and he was gone. He wrote me some stupid message that being with me is too pushy and that he needs to think it all through alone. He said it is not a breakup. And he will let me know once he is ready.\n\nIdk what to do. This all seems disgusting. I think he is just a coward and does not want to think through anything. It seems like he wanted to push me to break up with him but when I did not his plan backfired. Now he is just stalling to push me probably. It also seems that he did not really though it through since he just dramatically changed his life after meeting some girl two weeks ago.\n\nWhat do I do? We had an apartment together, a dog and we have a lot of friends and activities together. From my friends I heard he wants to keep both the apartment and the dog and tells them I would be evil if I wanted to \"take everything from him\". This all while he acts he is still not decided and we are together just on a pause. My whole life was crushed and not even openly. I still love him and actually hope he really will change his mind but everyone keeps telling me he probably will not even ever show up in person to do the thing. \n\nTLDR: My bf of 7,5 years was planning to leave me while claiming all is good and that he loves me, then he left me while I was on an errand and now claims it is not a breakup. He keeps telling me he is not decided while hiding our relationship and claiming he wants our apartment and dog to other people. I don't know how to cope with my life now or how to get over this.",

You deserve so much better.\n\nIt's clear that he's not taking responsibility for his actions and is instead trying to shift the blame onto you. His message about needing space and time to think is a classic tactic to buy himself time and distance himself from the situation. He's not giving you a genuine chance to work through your issues or have an honest conversation.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I would recommend taking some time to prioritize your own emotional well-being and safety. You've been through a significant trauma, and it's essential to process your feelings and emotions with support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist.\n\nRegarding the practical aspects, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. Document everything: Keep a record of all conversations, messages, and emails. This will help you track the progression of events and provide evidence if needed.\n2. Secure your belongings: Make sure you have access to your apartment and the dog's care. You may want to consider changing the locks or reassigning joint responsibilities.\n3. Focus on yourself: Use this time to rediscover your interests, hobbies, and passions. Reconnect with friends and family who support you.\n4. Set boundaries: If your boyfriend contacts you, set clear boundaries about what you're willing to discuss and what you're not. Avoid getting drawn into arguments or emotional manipulation.\n5. Prepare for the worst-case scenario: Unfortunately, it's possible that your boyfriend may not come back or may not be willing to work on the relationship. Be prepared to move forward with your life and consider counseling or support groups to help you heal.\n\nRemember, you are strong, capable, and deserving of love and respect. You don't have to be tied to this toxic situation. Take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's natural to still have feelings for your boyfriend, even if he's treated you poorly. It's okay to acknowledge those feelings, but don't let them cloud your judgment or prevent you from taking care of yourself."

It's normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take your time to adjust.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Join clubs or groups that align with your interests: This could be anything from a sports team, a book club, or even a photography club. Not only will you meet like-minded people, but you'll also have a sense of purpose and something to look forward to.\n2. Attend school events and gatherings: Whether it's a welcome assembly, a school play, or a sports game, showing up to these events can help you get a feel for the school's culture and vibe. You might even meet some new people who share similar interests.\n3. Be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not: It's easy to try to fit in by being someone you think others want you to be, but trust me, it's exhausting and ultimately, it won't work. Be authentic, and people will be drawn to your unique energy.\n4. Find a buddy or study group: Having someone to sit with at lunch or study with can make a huge difference. Look for someone who's in a similar class or has similar interests, and strike up a conversation.\n5. Be patient and persistent: Building friendships takes time, and it's normal to face rejection or feel like you're not clicking with someone. Don't get discouraged, and keep putting yourself out there.\n\nLastly, remember that making friends is not a competition. It's not about trying to be the most popular or the most liked. It's about finding people who share your values, interests, and sense of humor.\n\nYou've got this, and you'll find your tribe in no time!"

I have a job that pays $13.20/h and I work 1 hour a day after school ( I get out of school pretty late). Plus, I work 4 hours a day on non school days (excluding weekends). Can y’all help me start the process now?",
    "human": "I’d like to give you a real answer here. I think it’s important that you fully visualize the end goal here so that you can stay on track. Let’s assume that you have a full 3 years ahead of you before you move it. \n\nAt your current salary, you annually earn $6750 (180x 1 hour days + 80x 4 hour days). You won’t be paying taxes if your income is under $10,000, so all of that is yours. Limit your spending and save about $5,000 the 1st year. \n\nIf you followed this plan for the full 3 years, you would be well ahead of most 18 year olds, with $15,000 in savings more or less. Be prepared to find a better paying job after you move because your savings will only last a good 15 months assuming you find a roommate and even less if you plan to live alone.\n\nBut you can do more… by putting your money to work for you. \n\nMy first intuition is that you’re young, ambitious, and not afraid to work. You can take your first $500, buy a vacuum, an extension cord, some towels, some glass and surface cleaner, and some q-tips for $200 max. Use the remaining money to boost a Facebook post that says something like “high school student cleaning interiors of cars to pay for college, $60-100 depending on the size of the vehicle.” I phrased it this way because you don’t want people to take pity on you by explaining your situation. The general public has their own issues to deal with. But people love a success story. By representing ambition over self pity life will be easier for you.\n\nWork your normal job until you start getting calls. When the work comes in, now you’re doing 2 cars per week for $120-200 rather than working 5 times per week for $67.50. Assuming you did this for 3 years $18,720-$31,200, and likely all cash money. More money for less work. Have more time on your hands? Scale these numbers for 3 cars, 4 cars, 5 cars per week and the numbers will impress you. \n\nBut this strategy could apply to several different ventures. If you take action now, you might find yourself with a great scaleable income before you even graduate high school, that you can take even further afterwards. Not to mention the entrepreneurial skills that will benefit every area of your life. Find what works for you, and put your money to work. You have a golden opportunity to set yourself up for a better life. Best of luck to you.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're thinking ahead and wanting to take control of your finances. It's great that you're motivated to save up and move out on your own. I'm happy to help you get started.\n\nFirst, let's crunch some numbers. With your job, you're working a total of 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is 25 hours a week. At $13.20/hour, that's $330 per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, that's a total of $17,040 per year.\n\nNow, let's assume you want to save up enough to move out on your 18th birthday. That's in about 3 years. To calculate how much you need to save each month, we can divide the total amount you need by the number of months you have to save.\n\nLet's assume you want to save up enough for a security deposit, first month's rent, and some extra for unexpected expenses. A rough estimate for a security deposit and first month's rent in your area might be around $2,000 to $3,000. Let's aim for the higher end, $3,000.\n\nYou have 36 months (3 years) to save up. To calculate your monthly savings goal, divide $3,000 by 36:\n\n$3,000 ÷ 36 = $83.33 per month\n\nNow, let's see how much you can realistically save each month. You mentioned you work 1 hour a day after school, which is $13.20. On non-school days, you work 4 hours, which is $52.80. Your total daily earnings are:\n\n$13.20 (after school) + $52.80 (non-school days) = $66.00\n\nSince you work 5 days a week, your weekly earnings are:\n\n$66.00 x 5 = $330\n\nYour monthly earnings would be:\n\n$330 x 4 = $1,320\n\nNow, let's subtract your monthly expenses from your monthly earnings. You'll need to estimate your expenses, but for now, let's assume you'll have some basic expenses like food, transportation, and entertainment. A rough estimate for these expenses might be around $500-600 per month. Let's assume you'll have $550 per month in expenses.\n\n$1,320 (monthly earnings) - $550 (monthly expenses) = $770\n\nYou'll have $770 left over each month after expenses. This is your disposable income, which you can use for saving. To reach your goal of saving $83.33 per month, you'll need to adjust your spending habits and make some sacrifices.\n\nHere are some tips to help you save more:\n\n1. Cut back on unnecessary expenses: Identify areas where you can cut back on spending, such as reducing your social media use, canceling subscription services, or finding cheaper alternatives for entertainment.\n2. Create a budget: Track your income and expenses to see where your money is going. Make a budget that accounts for your necessary expenses and sets aside a fixed amount for saving.\n3. Increase your income: Consider taking on extra shifts, getting a part-time job, or selling items you no longer need to increase your income.\n4. Automate your savings: Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account to make saving easier and less prone to being neglected.\n\nRemember, saving $3,000 in 3 years will require discipline and sacrifice. But with a solid plan and consistent effort, you can reach your goal and achieve financial independence by the time you turn 18.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and your actual expenses and income may vary. Be prepared to adjust your plan as needed and stay committed to your goals. Good luck!"

He mentioned that he’s very bad with dates and that his sisters often have to remind him of his parents’ birthdays so he can pick up a gift. He said he would do his best to remember mine. \n\nIt’s been a while since that conversation, and I was positive he forgot it.

The thing is, my best friend is getting married the day after my birthday and since it’s largely the same group of people, I decided not to have any kind of dinner/party/gathering this year. So, as we were chatting I mentioned “my birthday is next week but I’m not doing much for it because of the wedding.” Essentially I was reminding him in an effort to avoid an issue of him forgetting. \n\nFrom his blank reaction, I am absolutely sure he forgot it.

I didn’t expect anything much - just a verbal happy birthday would have been great, and maybe we’d celebrate when I see him soon. \n\nWell, my birthday was today and he of course, forgot it.

It's a natural reaction, and it's okay to feel hurt.\n\nAs for how to respond, I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. However, before you do, take a moment to collect your thoughts and emotions. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about my birthday. I know you forgot, and I'm not expecting a big celebration or anything, but a simple 'happy birthday' would have meant a lot to me. I understand that mistakes happen, but it feels like it slipped your mind twice – first when I mentioned it earlier, and then again today. I'm feeling a bit hurt and disappointed. Can we talk about why you forgot, and how we can make sure something like this doesn't happen again in the future?\"\n\nThis approach allows you to express your feelings without being accusatory or dramatic. By framing it as a conversation, you're showing that you're willing to work together to find a solution and move forward.\n\nIt's also important to remember that relationships involve growth, communication, and compromise. If your boyfriend is truly sorry and willing to make amends, it could be an opportunity for both of you to improve your communication and show each other that you care.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself during this conversation. You deserve to feel valued and respected in your relationship."

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. Losing stuff can be super frustrating and stressful! It's like, you know you had it just a minute ago, and now it's gone! \n\nFirstly, let's identify some common habits that might be contributing to your forgetfulness:\n\n1. **Multitasking**: Are you often juggling multiple tasks, conversations, or thoughts at once? This can lead to mental overload and decreased attention to your surroundings.\n2. **Habits**: Do you have any routines or habits that involve putting things down or setting things aside without double-checking?\n3. **Distractions**: Are you often in environments with high levels of noise, visual stimuli, or social distractions that make it hard to focus?\n4. **Stress and anxiety**: Are you experiencing high levels of stress or anxiety, which can impair your memory and attention?\n\nNow, here are some strategies to help you stay on track and reduce forgetfulness:\n\n1. **Create a routine**: Establish a consistent daily routine, including designated times for checking your belongings, like when you're leaving a room or getting up from a meal.\n2. **Designate a \"launching pad\"**: Choose a specific spot, like a hook or tray near the door, where you'll always place your keys, wallet, and phone when you come home.\n3. **Use reminders**: Set reminders on your phone or put notes in strategic places to remind you to check for your belongings before leaving a location.\n4. **Use technology to your advantage**: Consider using apps like Tile or TrackR to track your belongings, or apps that help you remember specific tasks or appointments.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Take a few deep breaths, focus on the present moment, and pay attention to your surroundings. This can help you stay more mindful and aware of your belongings.\n6. **Simplify your life**: Reduce clutter and minimize the number of items you're responsible for keeping track of. This can help reduce stress and make it easier to stay organized.\n7. **Take your time**: When getting up or leaving a location, take a moment to double-check that you have all your belongings before rushing off.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to develop new habits and adjust to these strategies. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you still forget things occasionally. With time and practice, you'll get better at staying on track!\n\nAs for your sketchbook, I'm so sorry to hear that you lost it. While you may not be able to recover the original, you could try creating a digital copy of your work or drawing again. Sometimes, creating something new can be a great way to process and move forward.\n\nLastly, consider keeping a \"lost and found\" journal or log to record the items you've lost and what happened to them. This can help you identify patterns and develop strategies to avoid similar situations in the future."

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're thinking ahead! Meeting your deductible without breaking the bank requires some strategic planning. Since you're looking to stay within your budget, I'd recommend focusing on essential services that are likely to be covered by your insurance plan.\n\nHere are some medical services that might help you meet your deductible without overspending:\n\n1. Preventive care: Schedule a check-up with your primary care physician (PCP) to get your annual physical, and make sure you're up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations. These services are often fully or partially covered by your insurance plan.\n2. Routine screenings: If you're due for any routine screenings, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, or blood work, schedule them now. These tests can help detect potential health issues early on, and your insurance plan might cover them partially or fully.\n3. Dental care: If you need a dental cleaning, filling, or other routine dental work, consider scheduling an appointment. Many insurance plans cover a portion of dental expenses, and meeting your deductible might give you a chance to get more coverage.\n4. Vision care: If you need an eye exam or glasses, schedule an appointment with an optometrist. Some insurance plans cover a certain amount of vision care services, and meeting your deductible might help you get more coverage.\n5. Physical therapy: If you have any chronic pain or mobility issues, consider scheduling a physical therapy session. Many insurance plans cover physical therapy sessions, and meeting your deductible might give you more coverage for ongoing treatment.\n\nBefore booking any appointments, make sure to:\n\n* Check your insurance plan's coverage and copays for each service.\n* Confirm that the provider is in-network to avoid surprise bills.\n* Ask about any out-of-pocket costs or deductibles associated with each service.\n* Prioritize services based on your health needs and financial situation.\n\nRemember, meeting your deductible is just the first step. It's essential to stay on top of your health insurance plan's requirements and make sure you're getting the most out of your coverage."

    "base_reply": "Dealing with someone who talks over you can be incredibly frustrating! I'm glad you're looking for a solution rather than just avoiding the situation.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that you can't control how others communicate, but you can control how you respond to it. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Establish a clear and calm tone**: When speaking, try to maintain a calm and assertive tone. Avoid getting defensive or raising your voice, as this can escalate the situation. Instead, speak slowly and clearly, and make sure to finish your thoughts before pausing for the other person to respond.\n2. **Use non-verbal cues**: Make eye contact with the person, but also subtly use non-verbal cues like tilting your head, raising an eyebrow, or pausing briefly to signal that you're not done speaking. This can help the other person understand that you're not finished yet.\n3. **Pause and rephrase**: If the person jumps in while you're speaking, pause for a brief moment, take a deep breath, and rephrase your sentence or thought. This shows that you're not going to let them steamroll over you, and it gives you a chance to reassert yourself.\n4. **Set clear boundaries**: When the person complains that you're not letting them speak, you can say something like, \"I understand you have a lot to say, but I'd like to finish my thoughts before we move on. Can you please let me finish?\" or \"I'm not trying to interrupt you, but I need to finish my point before we discuss [topic].\"\n5. **Practice assertive body language**: Maintain good posture, keep your hands relaxed, and avoid crossing your arms or legs, which can give the impression that you're closed off or defensive. This can help you feel more confident and assertive in the conversation.\n6. **Don't internalize their behavior**: Remember that the other person's behavior is not a reflection of your worth or importance. Try not to take their talking over personally, and focus on communicating your needs and thoughts effectively.\n\nRemember, you can't change the other person, but you can change how you respond to them. By using these strategies, you can maintain your composure and assert yourself in the conversation."

Maintain eye contact: Make sure to look at the person while they're speaking, but don't stare intensely. Aim for a gentle, relaxed gaze that conveys attention.\n2. Nod your head: A subtle nod can be a powerful way to show you're following along. It's a non-verbal cue that says, \"I'm with you, I'm listening.\"\n3. Use non-verbal nods: You can also use other non-verbal nods like tilting your head, raising an eyebrow, or making a slight facial expression that shows you're engaged.\n4. Ask open-ended questions: Encourage the person to keep talking by asking open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" This shows you're interested in what they're saying and want to hear more.\n5. Reflective listening: Reflective listening is a powerful technique where you paraphrase what the other person is saying to show you understand and are actively listening. For example, \"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying that...?\"\n6. Lean forward: Slightly leaning forward can show you're engaged and interested in the conversation. Just be mindful not to lean too far forward, as that can come across as aggressive.\n7. Avoid interrupting: One of the biggest turn-offs in a conversation is interrupting. Let the other person finish their thought before you respond.\n8. Use pauses: Pauses can be powerful in a conversation. Don't feel like you need to fill every silence with words. Sometimes, a thoughtful pause can show you're taking a moment to process what the other person is saying.\n\nRemember, active listening is about being present and engaged in the conversation. By using these techniques, you can show that you're listening without resorting to verbal cues like \"yeah\" or \"uh huh.\""

You've also had time to discuss and agree on long-term goals, including marriage. That's a strong foundation.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to recognize that getting to know someone is a continuous process.

Two years is a good amount of time to develop a deep emotional connection, but it's not a guarantee that you've seen all aspects of each other's personalities, habits, and behaviors.\n\nMarried or engaged people's experiences vary, but here are some general insights:\n\n* Some couples might feel ready to commit after a year or two, while others may take five or more years. It ultimately depends on individual circumstances, communication, and personal readiness.\n* Living together can accelerate the learning process, but it's not a substitute for the natural ups and downs of a relationship. You'll still face challenges and disagreements, even after years together.\n* It's common for people to idealize their partner in the early stages, and it's only natural to grow and learn more about each other over time.\n\nConsider asking yourself these questions:\n\n* Have you and your partner had open and honest conversations about your values, goals, and expectations for the future?\n* Have you experienced and worked through significant conflicts or challenges together?\n* Do you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts, feelings, and desires with each other?\n* Are you both on the same page regarding long-term plans, including children, finances, and lifestyle?\n\nUltimately, the decision to get engaged is personal and depends on your individual circumstances.

I moved away to College at 18 but we would call each other most days and see each other maybe once every 2 weeks. After College I moved in with my boyfriend who I've lived with every since. We kept up the calls and regular visits.\n\nAs time has passed, I've noticed negative quirks with my mom. She has always been incredibly chatty, but it feels like it's gotten to a point where when we talk, its a one way conversation. When in a group, it feels like she dominates. If anyone begins a topic, she'll pivot it to what she wants to talk about and then just barrage everyone with stories about her life for hours. She HATES when anyone tries to do this to her, and accuses them of talking over her or being rude.\n\nJust in general, now instead of being happy to see her, I worry that shes going to do something embarrassing or just dominate the situation to the point where it feels like theres no point in even doing it. It feels like all my friends, my partners family and friends etc all \"know\" what she's like and have accepted it, but laugh at her behind her back. To a degree I do this too, it feels like the only way I can cope with it. Me and my sister frequently talk to each other for hours about how she's driving us crazy.\n\nI think elements of these negatives have always existed its not like she's completely changed, but it feels like over the last 5 years or so, these negative quirks have intensified to the point where when we talk, I literally feel like she doesn't give a shit about anything I do or have to say. It's like shes bottled up a month of conversation topics in her head and then when we talk she unleashes them on me like a tidal wave.\n\nShe's also incredibly awkward when we're out. She will argue with all wait staff in restaurants we go to. Her food is too cold, its too hot, its not cooked enough, its overcooked. Either she has the worst luck of anyone I have ever met, or theres more to it than this. She isn't rude and berating to the staff, but its just so embarrassing. She'll just start talking to the wait staff about stupid things that they don't care about as well, just like she does with everyone else. When we go out with my parents and other people, I feel so ashamed. If we're in stores and the opportunity arises, she'll start talking to strangers about something for ages.\n\n2 years ago, I snapped at her when I was having lunch with her and my dad. I told her that she didn't listen to me and I feel like she doesn't care at all. That she was selfish, and our talks are just for her.

I felt bad, but sometimes you just have to say these things I feel.\n\nLast night, we had an argument about something petty and when we got off the phone I think it all just hit me at once and I cried for an hour. She hasnt changed since I told her 2 years ago, if anything she's even worse that she's even been.\n\nI'm supposed to be going to dinner with her and my dad next week and I'm absolutely dreading it. I know I'm not going to get a word in.

It's like she doesn't understand conversations are supposed to be 2 sided. I feel like I've completely lost my mom, and any attempt to reconcile the situation is going to result in her completely denying it and arguing she doesn't act this way, or breaking down in tears, only for 2 years to pass again with nothing changing.

It's not about being critical or unsupportive, but rather about setting boundaries and communicating your needs.\n\nBefore approaching the situation, take some time to reflect on your own emotions and what you want to achieve. What are your non-negotiables? What are you willing to compromise on? What are your goals for this conversation?\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and feelings. They may have some valuable insights or suggestions on how to approach the situation.\n\nWhen you do talk to your mom, try to approach it with empathy and understanding. Acknowledge that you love and care about her, and that you're concerned about how her behavior is affecting your relationships. Avoid blaming or attacking language, as this can escalate the situation.\n\nYou might say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that our conversations often feel one-sided. I feel like I'm not being heard or seen. I want to make sure we can have meaningful conversations where we both feel heard and valued. Can we work on making sure we take turns talking and listening to each other?\"\n\nIt's also essential to set clear boundaries and communicate them assertively. For example, if you don't want to engage in a particular topic, you can say:\n\n\"I understand you're excited about this, but I'm not really interested in talking about it right now. Can we move on to something else?\"\n\nRegarding her awkward interactions with wait staff and strangers, you might gently remind her that it's okay to ask for help or clarification without dominating the conversation. You could say:\n\n\"Hey Mom, I know you like to talk to the wait staff, but sometimes it can be overwhelming for them. Maybe we can ask them a question and then let them get back to their work?\"\n\nAs for teaching social skills to someone in their 70s, it's not about changing who they are, but rather about finding ways to adapt and communicate more effectively. You could try role-playing different scenarios with her, practicing active listening, and encouraging her to ask open-ended questions.\n\nRemember that you can't change your mom, but you can change how you respond to her behavior. By setting boundaries, communicating your needs, and practicing empathy, you can create a more balanced and fulfilling relationship.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize self-care and seek support from your partner, friends, and family. It's okay to take breaks or step away from the situation if it becomes overwhelming. You deserve to feel heard, seen, and respected in your relationships."

    "base_reply": "Congratulations on being financially independent at a young age! It's great that you're thinking about your money and wanting to make the most of it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to investments. What works for someone else might not work for you, and it's crucial to consider your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before making any decisions.\n\nThat being said, here are some general guidelines and recommendations:\n\n1. Emergency Fund: It's always a good idea to have an easily accessible savings account with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. This fund will help you cover unexpected expenses, avoid debt, and ensure you're not dipping into your investments during market fluctuations.\n2. High-Yield Savings Account: For a low-risk, liquid option, consider a high-yield savings account. These accounts typically offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, usually around 1.5-2.5% APY. You can find high-yield savings accounts at online banks like Ally, Marcus, or Discover.\n3. Index Funds or ETFs: For a more passive, long-term approach, consider investing in index funds or ETFs that track the overall market, such as the S&P 500 or the Total Stock Market. These funds provide broad diversification and can help you ride out market fluctuations. Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab are well-established institutions with low fees and a wide range of index funds.\n4. Robo-Advisors: If you're new to investing, robo-advisors can be a great way to get started. These platforms use algorithms to create a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals. Some popular robo-advisors include Betterment, Wealthfront, and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.\n5. Cryptocurrencies: If you're interested in cryptocurrencies, it's essential to remember that they're highly volatile and not a traditional investment. Consider it a speculative investment, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance are popular platforms for buying and selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen choosing a financial institution, consider the following factors:\n\n* Fees: Look for low or no fees for transactions, management, and maintenance.\n* Minimums: Check if there are minimum balance requirements or account minimums.\n* Interest rates: Compare interest rates for savings accounts, CDs, and other investment products.\n* Reputation: Research the institution's reputation, security, and customer service.\n* Mobile app and online platform: Ensure the institution has a user-friendly mobile app and online platform for easy account management.\n\nIn terms of the current economic situation, it's true that the US economy is experiencing some uncertainty. However, it's essential to remember that the stock market has historically recovered from past downturns, and it's often wise to have a long-term perspective.\n\nBefore making any investment decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor or conducting your own research to determine the best course of action for your individual circumstances. It's also essential to diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket.\n\nRemember, investing is a marathon, not a sprint. It's crucial to be patient, disciplined, and informed to achieve your long-term financial goals."

Here's the deal:\n\nYou should not return the check. You've already claimed the credit on your taxes, and the IRS has already processed it. The check is essentially a refund of the credit you claimed.\n\nHowever, to avoid any potential issues or confusion, it's a good idea to keep accurate records of both the original claim on your tax return and the subsequent check you received. You might want to:\n\n1. File the check with your tax records, so you can easily reference it if needed.\n2. Keep a copy of your tax return and the check in a safe place, in case you need to prove you received the stimulus payment.\n\nIt's also a good idea to review your tax return and make sure you didn't over-claim the credit. If you realize you claimed too much, you might need to adjust your taxes accordingly. Better safe than sorry!\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or the IRS directly if you have any doubts or concerns about your specific situation."

    "sentence": "My gf [f28] and I [m33] are in a relationship for a little over a year. We moved in together after 6 months of dating. Overall, living with her has been great.However, we recently had some rough weeks with many arguments where I often felt that she is very sensitive, takes things personally, and is simply insulting me (e.g. she called me stubborn, avoidant, narrow minded; we had one session with her therapist together who agreed with me that this is harsh). No need to go into detail here but we are both working on our communication style and I'd say we are making progress. Another important fact is that my work permit in the US expires this summer, even though there is a good chance that my employer finances me for at least another year (which I will know in a few weeks).\n\nAfter 10 months of dating (three of which living together) she brought up marriage for the first time. I told her that this is a huge decision not only because of livelong committing to a relatively fresh relationship but also because I would commit to permanently living in the US, which I need to wrap my head around. She said she doesn't understand my hesitation and that she feels rejected. When she asked what else I need to know to marry I responded  that we're still getting to know each other (especially given the way how our fights are handled) and that it is a viable option for me in a year or two. She said that she loves me and sees her future with me and that this would also allow us to get a Greencard for me. \n\nFast forward three months. I'm on a short trip in a different city without her right now. We had a video call earlier today in which she said she can't wait any longer and proposed on the phone (apparently after talking to her therapist and friends). She said she gives me two weeks to think about it since she knew I'd need some time and be overwhelmed. She made it clear that our relationship won't continue long term if I say no.\n\n I feel very stressed and barely slept all night. I love her and agree that a green card would be the best option long term but there is just a thing about her arguing with me and using ultimatums. Something similar happened when she asked me to move in with her. A while after moving in she told me that she would have broken up with me if I would have said no (but didn't tell me at the time so it doesn't influence my decision). Don't get me wrong, it is her right to end any relationship for whatever reason she wants, but I found it odd that she had this all or nothing approach. And now, again, it's all or nothing. \n\nI'm pretty indecisive now and wonder whether this ultimatum behavior and also the freshness of the relationship is a red flag. I don't want to jump naively into something like this and change my whole life out of pressure. Do you have any advice on how I can proceed and make up my mind? How do you know that marriage is right? Is that all too early, is that pressure already hinting that something's not right? I honestly don't know anymore.\n\nTldr: My [m33] gf [f28] proposed to me after one year of dating and ends the relationship if I say no. Is this a red flag?",
    "human": "With marriage, if it's not a \"hell yes\", then it must be a no.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on this significant decision. It's natural to feel overwhelmed and uncertain.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your concerns about her ultimatums and pressure tactics are valid. You're right to question whether this is a healthy dynamic in your relationship. It's crucial to prioritize your emotional well-being and consider whether you feel respected and valued in the relationship.\n\nGiven your concerns, I recommend taking a step back and having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings. Explain to her how her ultimatums make you feel and express your need for a more balanced and respectful approach to decision-making in your relationship. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her words and actions have on you, and this conversation can help clear the air.\n\nRegarding the timing of the proposal, it's indeed early for some people, and it's normal to feel pressured. Marriage is a significant commitment, and it's essential to ensure you're both on the same page. Consider asking yourself:\n\n1. Are you ready for this level of commitment, or are you feeling rushed?\n2. Have you had sufficient time to work through your differences and grow together as a couple?\n3. Do you feel like you're making this decision out of love and mutual respect, or are you feeling pressured?\n\nTo make a decision, take some time to reflect on your feelings and priorities. Ask yourself what's most important to you in a relationship and whether this proposal aligns with those values. Consider seeking guidance from a trusted friend, family member, or therapist to help you process your emotions and gain a fresh perspective.\n\nRemember, it's okay to say no to a proposal if you're not ready. It's better to be honest and respectful about your feelings than to rush into a decision that might not be right for you.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the importance of communication and compromise in a relationship. If you're not comfortable with the ultimatums and pressure tactics, it may be worth exploring whether this is the right relationship for you in the long term.\n\nTake your time, prioritize your emotional well-being, and make a decision that aligns with your values and priorities."

It's not uncommon for people to react in shock, fear, or discomfort when faced with mortality or trauma. \n\nBefore jumping to conclusions, try not to take it personally. It might be helpful to consider that she may be struggling with her own emotions and needs time to process.

Here's a simple trick that might help: instead of trying to force a specific topic or worry about what the other person thinks, focus on being genuinely curious and engaged.\n\nWhen you're with friends, try asking open-ended questions that encourage them to share more about themselves. This can be as simple as \"What's been the highlight of your week?\" or \"How was your weekend?\" These types of questions can help keep the conversation flowing and show that you're interested in getting to know them better.\n\nWith people you're less familiar with, you can try asking more lighthearted or observational questions. For example, \"How's your day going so far?\" or \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" These types of questions are easy to answer and can help break the ice.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to share a personal experience or story that's not too long or too personal. This can help create a sense of connection and give the other person something to respond to. Just be sure to keep it concise and relevant to the conversation.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid of silence! It's okay if there's a moment of quiet in the conversation. It doesn't mean you've failed or that the conversation is dying. Instead, use the silence as an opportunity to listen actively and show that you're engaged. You might even try nodding or making a supportive noise to show you're still paying attention.\n\nRemember, the goal of a conversation isn't to fill every moment with words, but to build a connection with the other person. By being curious, engaged, and genuine, you can create a conversation that flows naturally and feels enjoyable for both parties."

As a healthcare professional, it's impressive that you're acknowledging the importance of staying calm under pressure. Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Prepare for the unexpected**: When you're in a high-stress environment like a hospital, it's inevitable that unexpected situations will arise. Anticipate this and mentally prepare yourself for the unexpected. Take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that you've handled tough situations before.\n2. **Mindfulness meditation**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you develop a greater sense of calm and awareness. Even a few minutes of meditation each day can make a significant difference. You can use apps like Headspace or Calm to guide you.\n3. **Breathe, breathe, breathe**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, take a few slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This simple technique can help calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, and exhaling for a count of 4.\n4. **Physical relaxation techniques**: When you're feeling anxious, your body tenses up. Try to release physical tension by rolling your shoulders, unclenching your fists, or doing some quick stretches. This can help calm your nervous system.\n5. **Reframe your thinking**: When you start to catastrophize, try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of thinking \"OH NO, WE'RE DOOMED!\", tell yourself \"Okay, this is a challenging situation, but I've got this. I've handled tough situations before.\"\n6. **Prioritize self-care**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks. When you're well-rested and nourished, you'll be better equipped to handle stressful situations.\n7. **Ask for help when needed**: Don't be afraid to ask your colleagues or a supervisor for support when you're feeling overwhelmed. They may be able to offer guidance or help you find a solution.\n8. **Practice positive self-talk**: When you're feeling anxious, try to focus on positive affirmations. Remind yourself that you're capable and competent, and that you've got this.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. The key is to acknowledge your emotions and take small steps towards managing them. By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you'll become more resilient and better equipped to handle stressful situations at work.\n\nAnd hey, if you ever need to channel your inner C-3PO, just remember: \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope!\""

Days before her party she asked me and our other best friend “A” for money since she haven’t gotten her birthday gift from her parents (which is the money she will use to pay for the expenses for her party). She told us she would pay me and A as soon as she got her money so me and A chipped in to pay for her party. 3 years later, she still hasn’t paid us back. There were multiple times when me and A asked her if she can pay us back. But each time we ask her, she will just apologize, tell us she doesn’t have any money at the moment, and promise that she will pay us back once she have money. \n\nBut it has been 3 years already. We went out countless of times already but she never paid us back. I don’t know if she forgot she owes us money but It’s just awkward to keep asking her to pay when it should’ve have been her responsibility to pay us back even if we don’t ask. Now I’m thinking of asking her again to pay me back because I desperately need the money but I am too shy to ask. Should I just forget that she owes us money or should I still ask her to pay? I desperately need money right now and the only way I can think of is to get that money back.

I got caught up with school and family stuff but thank you all for showing concern in my personal matter. I didn’t expect for this post to blow up. I saw most of the comments saying that I shouldn’t lend money and expect it to come back. I get this know. But here in my country, we have this thinking that it is much safer to lend money to our family and friends (if they need it) since they are closer to us and they are the ones who we trust more in paying us back our money. Well I learned the hard way that even your best friend you can’t trust 100%. And if you guys are wondering if I talked to her or what, I didn’t. You guys are right, the money is gone. What I will do is to never lend her or anyone anything ever again. I think if ever I will loan anybody again is if only they badly need it (eg. medical bills, any emergency stuff, etc).

It's not about the principle of lending money, but about the agreement you had made with her to pay you back.\n\nConsidering your current financial situation, it's natural that you're thinking of asking her to pay you back. However, before doing so, I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating the relationship you have with your friend. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to express your concerns and frustrations to her, rather than just asking her to pay you back.\n\nIf you do decide to ask her to pay you back, make sure to approach the conversation calmly and assertively. You can say something like, \"Hey, I know we lent you money for your birthday party a while back, and I understand that things have been tough for you. However, I'm in a tight spot financially right now, and I really need that money back. Can we work out a payment plan or find another solution that works for both of us?\"\n\nIt's also important to consider whether you're willing to continue investing emotional energy into this friendship if she's unable or unwilling to pay you back. You deserve to prioritize your own financial well-being and emotional well-being, and it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship if it's causing more harm than good.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. You don't owe your friend an explanation or justification for asking her to pay you back.

Need to make these next years count Hey guys, I don't usually post here, but because I am transferring to a university this fall (I should probably note that this is round 2 of a university, my previous one, college A, did not work out due to a slew of reasons, so I am transferring to college B in a few weeks), I really need (desperately need) to learn how to make friends in college.\n\nFirst of all, I have never had a wide circle of friends. I have a few *really* good friends, and that's it. I've never been one of those people to post on social media regularly, swarming up 100+ likes per photo or whatever. Unfortunately, pretty much 90% of my friends are transferring to other colleges, so it looks like I will have to start making friends at college B.\n\nAs I said, I went to college A last semester, and it simply didn't work out. Although the biggest reason was due to distance and financial reasons, a large portion of it was also due to the fact that I was practically incapable of making friends. I'm talking friends, not someone you just say \"Sup dude\" as you're walking to class. I had 3 roommates, and none of them really clicked with me. One of them did, however, but he just did his *own* things with *his* friends. I tried to invite myself (probably a bad idea) to a party he knew of, but felt like I was being intrusive.\n\nSame thing with clubs. Tried joining a few, but nothing ever came out of it - everyone seemed to had already formed their own cliques or whatever, leaving me as a ghost. Not a fun college experience overall. I went to a few parties thinking I made some friends along the way, but of course, the next morning when I tried talking to one of them, he didn't even remember who I was.\n\nSo I turn to you all. Clearly, I am not the best with making new friends, and in a way it really aggravates me because I have a wide variety of interests like music, hiking, snowboarding, etc, but unfortunately I have really paralyzing social anxiety - I've told my friends, but of course I don't get anxious around them, I've known them for years.\n\nDoes ANYONE have ANY tips on how to make friends in college? Parties? Clubs? Perhaps it was due to the college itself, but I found college A to be anything but a fun college experience. Need to make something happen at college B (less than three weeks at this point).\n\nTips? Advice? Suggestions? Thanks",
    "human": "I've had my fair share of problems with building friendships in college too, but I also learned a couple things that have really helped me out.\n\nFirst of all, you gotta invest in these new friendships. Like you mentioned, there's a bunch of people who already have their own social circles, but there are also MANY others who are likely in the same position as you. To deal with both kinds, however, it is essential that you show your interest in becoming closer friends. Like some people said, you can do so by hanging out with them or inviting them to do things you enjoy. \n\nI know anxiety can be a bitch, and if you're someone who enjoys spending time alone you're probably gonna get VERY picky with the people you see as potential friends, but if you want to build meaningful friendships you have to put in the time and effort. If you didn't click right away with someone, that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't be their friend. Similarly, even if clicked absolutely well with someone, you can't expect to become their BFF overnight. Now, you don't have to hang out with douchebags or every nice person you meet, but if you feel like there's some connection with them, even if it's at a very small level, you should bank on it. Some people will likely be as anxious, if not more, as you. So, even if you felt that some conversation or hangout with them went great and you see them as \"social ones\", don't be the one waiting for the invite, take the initiative! Even if they're busy, nice people will likely take note of it and reciprocate if they find an opportunity. You can start with the small things that everyone does often, like grabbing some lunch or going to the library. Also, **NEVER** decline an invite out of laziness/social anxiety from people you found nice, even if you end up having a shitty time you can say you gave it a shot and did something different for a change, working towards a more outgoing personality. \n\nIf you're on the quiet end, don't wait for people to talk to you, if you think you can strike up a conversation about something happening around, or want to join the conversation at one of those clubs/parties, just go for it. Try to jump past the meaningless small talk though, if you just force yourself to talk but don't actually have *something* to say it's gonna look needy and it can actually worsen your social anxiety as you're just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of thinking \"What am I gonna say next?\". If someone's telling you something, even if it's not quite in your interest, **listen to understand, not to respond**. It gets much easier to hop towards the topics that may be of your interest, you'd be surprised by how much you can have in common with people that seem completely different. Even if that \"click\" doesn't come eventually, it's still some useful practice for future conversations.\n\nLastly, don't give up! Social skills are developed like every other skill, through constant practice and quite a lot of hit and miss throughout often long periods of time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Celebrate every success but be aware of your defects and learn how to conquer them. Reflect on every experience, the things you did well and the things you still need to work on.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're seeking help and willing to acknowledge your struggles with making friends. It takes a lot of courage to admit our weaknesses, and I'm happy to offer some advice.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that making friends in college can be challenging for anyone, regardless of their background or interests. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with social anxiety, and it's great that you're aware of your own struggles.\n\nHere are a few tips that might help you make friends at college B:\n\n1. **Join clubs and organizations that align with your interests**: Since you mentioned music, hiking, and snowboarding, look for clubs or groups that focus on those activities. This way, you'll be surrounded by people who share your passions, making it easier to connect.\n2. **Attend events and gatherings related to your interests**: Attend concerts, outdoor group hikes, or snowboarding events. These events can be great opportunities to meet like-minded people.\n3. **Take small steps outside your comfort zone**: Start with small, low-stakes interactions, like striking up a conversation with someone in your class or at a club meeting. Gradually work your way up to more significant interactions.\n4. **Be authentic and genuine**: Don't try to be someone you're not. Be yourself, and people will be more likely to respond positively. Share your interests and passions, and ask others about theirs.\n5. **Find a buddy or study group**: Having a study partner or joining a study group can be a great way to build connections with others. You'll be working together towards a common goal, which can help break the ice.\n6. **Be patient and persistent**: Making friends takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep attending events, joining clubs, and reaching out to people until you find your tribe.\n7. **Consider reaching out to your classmates**: If you're taking classes that interest you, try reaching out to your classmates to study together or grab coffee. This can be a great way to build connections with people who share your academic interests.\n8. **Don't be too hard on yourself**: Remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to make friends immediately. Focus on building connections and having fun, rather than trying to force friendships.\n9. **Seek help if needed**: If your social anxiety is severe, consider reaching out to your college's counseling services for support. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your anxiety and help you build confidence.\n10. **Keep an open mind**: Be willing to try new things and step out of your comfort zone. You never know who you might meet or what experiences you might have.\n\nRemember, making friends is a process, and it may take some time. Focus on building connections with others, and don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't happen right away. Good luck, and I hope you find a great community at college B!"

So why not... free food. However he started saying, I should start giving him money in cash, equal to whatever he's buying for me, so I'm basically giving him money and he'll pay for me using his meal plan. No more free food so I don't really want to go, I also don't want to start giving him cash for something he's inviting me to go to because then it feels like I'm paying him to take me to get food. \n\nTechnically speaking, the money is still the same as if I bought the food myself. I get a $5 sandwich, I lose $5, only difference is he is pocketing my $5, which doesn't feel right. I liked the free food. But I don't want to go and spend my money just to help him use up his meal plan. \n\nI've been making excuses but I can't keep doing it for the rest of the school year.

    "base_reply": "The classic conundrum! It's great that you're aware of the awkwardness and want to handle it with care.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your friend's request is reasonable, and you're not obligated to agree to it. You've been enjoying the free food, but it's understandable that you don't want to start paying for it or feel like you're being taken advantage of.\n\nWhen you have the conversation with your friend, be honest and direct, but also empathetic. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I appreciate you offering to take me out for lunch and helping me use up your meal plan. However, I've been thinking, and I'm not comfortable with the new arrangement where I give you cash and you use your meal plan to pay for me. For me, it feels like I'm paying for the food, even though the money is technically the same. I know it might seem like a small thing, but it's making me feel uncomfortable. I think it's best if we just stick to our usual arrangement or find a different way to use up your meal plan. I value our friendship, and I don't want this to affect our hangouts.\"\n\nBy being open and honest, you're giving your friend a chance to understand your perspective and adjust their expectations. It's possible they might not have realized how you felt, and they might be willing to compromise or find an alternative.\n\nRemember to listen to your friend's response and be willing to find a solution that works for both of you. If they're understanding, you can continue your weekly lunches without the awkwardness. If they're not, you can still maintain the friendship while setting boundaries.\n\nLastly, don't worry too much about appearing like you're \"ruining\" the friendship. Honesty and open communication are essential in any relationship, and your friend should respect your boundaries. If they don't, it might be a sign of a deeper issue that needs to be addressed."

You're showing up for them, and that's what matters.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to meet their expectations of expensive gifts, consider having an open and honest conversation with them about your financial situation and what you're comfortable spending. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I've noticed that no matter what I get you, you're always disappointed. I want to make sure I'm getting you something you'll really appreciate, but I also want to be honest with you about what I can afford.

Maybe we can find something that fits within my budget and still shows I care.\"\n\nThis approach acknowledges their disappointment while also setting clear boundaries and expectations. It's possible they may not even realize how much you're stretching to get them something they want, and this conversation can help clear the air.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider setting a budget for gifts and sticking to it. It's okay to say, \"I love you, but I can only afford to spend X amount on gifts this year.\" This can help manage their expectations and prevent disappointment.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize self-care and self-compassion.

While there's no magic formula to look younger, I can offer some practical tips that might help you feel more confident and radiant. Remember, it's a journey, and progress takes time.\n\nFirstly, focus on building a healthy lifestyle foundation:\n\n1. **Hydrate**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses. Dehydration can lead to dull skin, fatigue, and premature aging.\n2. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Aim for a rainbow on your plate to ensure you're getting a broad range of vitamins and minerals.\n3. **Exercise regularly**: Find activities you enjoy, such as walking, yoga, or swimming, and aim for at least 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week. Exercise boosts energy, mood, and circulation, which can give you a more radiant glow.\n4. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body repair and regenerate itself. Poor sleep can lead to puffy eyes, dark circles, and a tired complexion.\n5. **Manage stress**: High stress levels can cause inflammation, which can lead to premature aging. Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or journaling to help manage your stress.\n\nNow, for some tips specific to looking younger:\n\n1. **Exfoliate regularly**: Use a gentle exfoliant 1-2 times a week to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. This can help even out your skin tone and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n2. **Use sunscreen**: UV rays are a significant contributor to premature aging. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily, even on cloudy days.\n3. **Moisturize**: Use a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer that suits your skin type. This will help lock in moisture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n4. **Take breaks from technology**: Prolonged screen time can lead to dry, tired eyes and a dull complexion. Take regular breaks to rest your eyes and give your skin a chance to recover.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This could be reading, taking a relaxing bath, or practicing yoga.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, but it's also important to be patient. It can take time to see results, and it's normal to experience setbacks. Celebrate small victories along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two.\n\nLastly, focus on building a positive mindset. Practice self-compassion, and remind yourself that looking good is not just about physical appearance, but also about feeling good. By prioritizing your overall well-being, you'll naturally radiate a sense of confidence and vitality that can make you look and feel more youthful."

Technology advances quickly, and outdated devices can be a waste of space and energy.\n* If it's still functional but no longer serves a purpose, ask yourself: \"When was the last time I used this?\" If it's been more than 6-12 months, it's likely you won't miss it.\n* For items like phones or laptops, consider the environmental impact of upgrading. If your device is still in good condition, consider donating or recycling it instead of buying new.\n\nFor clothing:\n\n* If you haven't worn something in a year, it's likely you won't miss it. Consider donating or selling gently used items to make room for new pieces that bring you joy.\n* If you're unsure, try the \"hanger trick\": hang your clothes with the hook facing the opposite direction. When you wear an item, hang it back up with the hook facing the normal direction. After a few months, consider letting go of items that are still facing the opposite direction.\n\nFor random items:\n\n* Ask yourself: \"What's the purpose of this item?\" If it no longer serves a purpose or holds sentimental value, it's likely time to let it go.\n* Consider the 80/20 rule: 80% of the time, you likely use 20% of your belongings. Identify the items that fall into that 20% and prioritize keeping those.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Set a \"one in, one out\" rule: whenever you acquire a new item, get rid of an old one to maintain a balanced amount of possessions.\n* Schedule regular decluttering sessions to maintain your space and keep your belongings organized.\n* Don't be too hard on yourself – it's okay to keep items that hold sentimental value or bring you joy, even if they're not strictly necessary.\n\nRemember, decluttering is a process, and it's okay to take your time.

    "human": "To quote Shia Labeouf \"Just do it\". No matter what it's nerve wracking to talk to someone you're interested in so you just have ignore the nerves and jump in. Sure It might not go well but not speaking up has a 100% failure rate so just go with the better odds.",
    "base_reply": "The old familiar nemesis: approach anxiety! It's great that you're aware of it and willing to work on it. Since you're good at talking to people in general, it's likely that your anxiety is more related to the uncertainty and risk involved in approaching someone you're interested in. Here's a suggestion:\n\nStart small. Don't try to tackle the big, daunting task of approaching a girl you're interested in just yet. Instead, start by practicing your social skills in smaller, less intimidating settings. Strike up conversations with cashiers, baristas, or coworkers you don't know well. These interactions are low-stakes, and you can build confidence in your ability to engage with others.\n\nNext, focus on building a sense of comfort with vulnerability. Write down your thoughts, feelings, and desires in a journal. Practice sharing your thoughts and feelings with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you become more comfortable with being open and honest, which is essential for building connections with others.\n\nWhen you feel ready, try approaching someone you're interested in, but this time, focus on having a genuine conversation rather than trying to \"pick them up.\" Ask them questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest in getting to know them. Remember, the goal is to build a connection, not to impress or manipulate.\n\nLastly, reframe your mindset around rejection. It's inevitable that not everyone will be interested in you, and that's okay. Focus on the value of taking risks and putting yourself out there, rather than the potential outcome. Remember that every \"no\" brings you closer to the \"yes\" you're looking for.\n\nLastly, take care of yourself. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating well. A healthy body and mind will help you feel more confident and centered, making it easier to tackle approach anxiety.\n\nRemember, overcoming approach anxiety takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. You got this!"

In order to get a job where I might be able to save money, I would have to uproot my life: move back to the USA and start over with little/no support from others.\n\nI go around and around in my head about it.

It's like being stuck between two opposing forces: gratitude for what you have and the desire for growth and improvement.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar dilemmas, and it's normal to feel uncertain about what to do.\n\nTo get out of this circular thinking, let's break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Ask yourself some questions:\n\n1. What are your non-negotiables? What are the things that are essential to your well-being, happiness, and personal growth? For you, is it financial security, a sense of community, or something else?\n2. What are your values? What matters most to you in life? Are you willing to compromise on certain aspects of your life to achieve your goals, or are there some things you're not willing to sacrifice?\n3. What are your goals? Are they specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)? Are you clear about what you want to achieve in the short and long term?\n4. What are the pros and cons of staying in your current situation versus making a change? Weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each option, including the potential risks and challenges.\n5. How do you define \"settling\"? Is it simply accepting what you have, or is it giving up on your goals and aspirations? Be honest with yourself about your motivations and fears.\n6. What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? What would you try if you had unlimited resources and support? Sometimes, thinking about this can help you tap into your true desires and aspirations.\n7. Finally, consider seeking outside perspectives. Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your concerns and feelings. Sometimes, an outside perspective can help you gain clarity and new insights.\n\nRemember, it's okay to acknowledge that you're not happy with every aspect of your life, but it's also important to recognize what you do have and appreciate the good things. It's a balance between gratitude and growth.\n\nTake your time, and don't rush into any decisions. Keep exploring, reflecting, and seeking guidance until you feel more confident about what's right for you."

That's already a huge step. Now, let's break it down into manageable, bite-sized chunks. Here are some tips to help you ease back into the outside world:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with short, low-stakes interactions. Try a 10-15 minute walk outside, or grab a coffee from a nearby café. These tiny steps can help you build confidence and get your social juices flowing again.\n2. **Schedule it in**: Treat re-entry as a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, just like your work hours. Set a specific time and day for your outings, so you can gradually build momentum.\n3. **Find a buddy**: Having someone to accompany you can make the experience less overwhelming. Invite a friend, family member, or even a colleague to join you for a walk or coffee. This can also help you feel more accountable.\n4. **Identify your comfort zones**: Reflect on the types of environments and activities that make you feel comfortable. For instance, if you're not ready for loud, crowded spaces, try a quiet park or a peaceful café. If you're anxious about socializing, start with solo activities like reading or people-watching.\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed or anxious. Acknowledge your emotions, take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. Be kind to yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you need to take a step back.\n6. **Gradually increase exposure**: As you become more comfortable, you can start increasing the duration, frequency, or complexity of your outings. For example, try a longer walk, join a community group, or attend a social event.\n7. **Focus on the present moment**: Instead of worrying about the future or past, focus on the present moment. Enjoy the sights, sounds, and sensations around you. This mindfulness can help you stay grounded and centered.\n\nRemember, re-entry is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Be patient, kind, and gentle with yourself as you ease back into the outside world. You got this!"

    "sentence": "how to act normal when speaking to new people For some reason, I get extremely awkward around new people that I don't know. I will stutter, stumble over my words, and feel extremely intimidated by them. It's like my brain is screaming at me that they're judging every word I say and I usually end up saying something awkward or stupid. I'm also very shy because of this reason. \n\nHowever with people I'm comfortable with I'm easily confident, funny (I hope) and easy going. I speak smoothly and have no problems communicating. \n\nHow can I copy this behaviour with people I don't know very well? I turn so red while speaking, and the stuttering is awful, and it's quite embarrassing. Is there any mindset or thoughts you can think of to make things easier?",
    "human": "Listen more than you talk and interject when you have something to say, don't just talk to talk and that will go a long way.\n\nAlso, talk about things you are interested in, because you have a knowledge of them you will be more confident when talking about them.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's like you're two different people, and that can be really frustrating. Don't worry, I'm here to help you work on bridging that gap.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the mindset shift. When you're with people you're comfortable with, you're not worried about being judged or evaluated, right? You're just being yourself. To replicate that with new people, try to focus on the present moment and the conversation, rather than worrying about how you're coming across. Remind yourself that everyone is nervous or awkward sometimes, even the people you think are super confident.\n\nHere's a thought experiment to help you shift your focus: imagine you're having a conversation with a friend you've known for years. You're relaxed, laughing, and chatting easily. Now, imagine that same friend is in front of you, but you don't know them as well. It's still the same person, but your brain is adding an extra layer of anxiety. Recognize that this extra layer is just a mental construct, and try to let it go.\n\nAnother technique is to focus on active listening. When you're really engaged in a conversation, you're not worried about what others think of you, because you're too busy trying to understand what they're saying. So, make an effort to really listen to the other person, ask follow-up questions, and show genuine interest. This will help you feel more connected and less self-conscious.\n\nAs for the physical symptoms like stuttering and blushing, try to acknowledge them without judgment. Instead of getting frustrated with yourself, say, \"Ah, my heart is racing a bit,\" or \"I'm getting a bit nervous, but I'll try to relax.\" Recognize that these physical reactions are normal, and they'll pass.\n\nFinally, practice, practice, practice! The more you put yourself in situations where you're interacting with new people, the more comfortable you'll become. Start small, like striking up a conversation with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. Gradually work your way up to more significant interactions, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be a little awkward sometimes. It's a normal part of life, and it doesn't define who you are as a person. With time and practice, you'll become more confident in your ability to connect with new people, and those stuttering and blushing moments will become fewer and farther between."

Now I feel like an asshole.\n\nI know this is tricky. I was always upfront about how I felt for her. Never lied and was open about my romantic and sexual feelings. \n\nShe told me that after an incident she felt like I didn’t fit the criteria for the person she wanted to be with. I said that is fine and after some heartbreaking deliberation decided that I couldn’t be friends.\n\nA little more background, she didn’t outright tell me she lost attraction. She waited a few months as she was hoping I’d just “get it” after constantly turning me down. I admit to being clueless and deliberately ignorant. She has a boyfriend now. He’s a cool dude I assume, but he lives a plane flight away. \n\nWe talked about everything together and I even help her with emotional troubles. We even had a few vulnerable moments. When she told me how she really felt I was devastated. I thought I could try being friends for a bit, but I realized after seeing her face light up talking about this other guy, that it was too much. \n\nI didn’t just cold shoulder her. I helped her work on finding a support system that she can trust with her honest feelings and was preparing to move on with my life. \n\nIt just doesn’t feel like I should stick around to be this negative, jealous energy when she’s doing well. She super bright and charming, so I know she’ll be okay.\n\nShe says she loves me as a person and sees value in me, but I really like her. I told her it was basically asking me to torture myself for our friendship and she thinks love is wanting what’s good for the other person even if it means you don’t get what you want. I agree, but that makes me confused.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone. I have read all your advice and comments. I won’t lie and say that I don’t feel a sense of validation, but I will say that I’m more confident than ever in my first response.

Anyhow, take care and thanks again!\n\nEdit 2: I didn’t expect this post to get this much attention, so thank you all for your words. Some were harsh, some skeptical. I understand. The incident in question involves us both and a coworker of mine (F27) going out for drinks months ago. As I remember the moment, what I saw was a playful push between them may have been more as my friend reacted harshly to my coworker. I did check on her, but she felt like she wanted me to do more. I remember my coworker being mad at both of us (and deciding to not talk to me) because I did confront her about it. I was upset with my coworker, but my friend viewed it as she had to comfort me afterward. That was the nail in the coffin so to speak. Anyway, it doesn’t matter now, but it’s a good lesson for later. Irregardless, I think most of you are right and our relationship is unhealthy. She has a boyfriend, so whether or not she has emotional support is his problem. Thank you all for reading.Thank you all. I hear you and I see what you’re saying.

However, it's also important to recognize that love shouldn't be a one-way street. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a relationship, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs.\n\nIt sounds like you've come to realize that the relationship wasn't healthy for you, and that's a huge step.

Personal recommendations can be a great way to find someone trustworthy.\n2. **Local online classifieds**: Websites like Craigslist or local Facebook groups often have a \"gig economy\" section where people advertise their services. Just be sure to exercise caution when dealing with strangers and prioritize your safety.\n3. **Community centers or libraries**: Many community centers, libraries, or places of worship offer babysitting services or know of reliable sitters. They might have a list of recommended babysitters or be able to connect you with someone.\n4. **University or college campuses**: If there's a nearby university or college, you can try posting an ad on their student job boards or asking professors or teaching assistants if they know any students looking for babysitting work.\n5. **Local babysitting agencies**: While SitterCity didn't work out, there might be other local agencies that offer more reasonable pricing. You can try searching online for \"babysitting agencies near me\" or \"local babysitting services\" to find alternatives.\n\nRegarding pricing, you're not alone in thinking that $22-$35 per month is exorbitant. You can try negotiating with potential sitters or agencies to find a more affordable option.\n\nTo increase your chances of finding a good sitter, make sure to:\n\n* Clearly outline your expectations, including pay rate, hours, and any specific needs your child may have.\n* Conduct thorough interviews with potential sitters, asking about their experience, references, and any certifications they may have.\n* Check references and run a background check (if possible) to ensure the sitter is trustworthy.\n\nRemember, finding the right babysitter takes time and patience. Don't rush into anything, and prioritize your child's safety and well-being above all else.\n\nGood luck in your search!"

Our relationship has been a bit of a rollercoaster due to our own mental health struggles but we've always made things work in the end with love and understanding.\n\nThis past weekend we had had tickets to go to a festival that got cancelled last min. He isn't the biggest fan of festivals and the type of music because in his words \"it's for girls to dance around naked being s word and for people to have an excuse to do drugs and waste their life away\". I've tried to explain time after time how it really isn't like that and it's invalid since he's never actually been to a festival or let alone a concert in his life. I managed to convince him and we were excited till it got cancelled. So instead my friends and I planned to get tickets for a show for one night instead. He refused to go to that and has been extremely moody all week, accusing me of going to cheat on him, to \"dress like a s word\" for attention, anything hurtful he could think of to try to make me not go. We have no history of cheating and i've only been to one show in our relationship which again he behaved towards me the same but not to this extreme.\n\nI went with my 2 best friends anyway because I know i'm not doing anything wrong and wanted to have a fun night out and see my favourite artist. I promised not to partake in substances and keep the drinking to the medium.

I've texted multiple times giving my updates through the day to assure him my safety and never got a reply. No checking in, nothing, despite us constantly texting when we are apart.

Ignoring you for three days without any communication or explanation is unacceptable, especially considering your history of open communication and understanding in your relationship.\n\nAs for his accusations and outbursts, it's possible that your friends' theory about him using your going out as a way to direct his insecurities towards you might be true.

Take some time for self-care: You've been through a lot, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Take time to relax, talk to your friends, and do things that bring you joy.\n2. Have a calm and honest conversation: When he comes home, try to approach the conversation calmly and rationally. Share how his behavior has affected you and express your concerns about the lack of communication. Avoid blaming or accusing him, and focus on your own feelings and needs.\n3. Re-evaluate your priorities: This situation might be a wake-up call for you to re-examine the relationship and your priorities. Ask yourself if you're willing to work through this and potentially overcome his insecurities, or if it's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy and sustainable for you.\n4. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance. It's essential to have a support system to help you navigate this challenging situation.\n\nRemember, you deserve respect and communication in a relationship.

You know, I think a lot of people get stuck in the small talk phase because they're waiting for some magical moment to happen, but the truth is, it's often a process that requires effort and intentionality.\n\nHere's what I've found works: start by showing genuine interest in the other person. Ask open-ended questions that can't be answered with just a \"yes\" or \"no.\" Ask follow-up questions, and actively listen to their responses. People love to talk about themselves, and when you show you're genuinely interested, they'll open up to you.\n\nAnother thing that helps is to find common ground. It doesn't have to be a deep, profound connection, but something as simple as a shared hobby or interest can be a great conversation starter. And don't be afraid to share something about yourself in return – it's a great way to build rapport and create a sense of mutual understanding.\n\nNow, I know it's easy to get caught up in the idea that you need to be super charismatic or outgoing to bond with people, but the truth is, it's often the simple, everyday interactions that lead to deeper connections. So, take the time to learn people's names, ask how their day is going, and show genuine interest in their lives.\n\nFinally, be patient and don't get discouraged if it takes time. Building relationships is a process, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on the present moment, and don't worry too much about the outcome.\n\nRemember, bonding with new acquaintances is about creating a sense of connection and understanding, not about trying to manipulate or impress someone.

I responded with, “Honestly, the only thing that really bothers me is that I feel like you don’t value the work I do at home.”\n\nThe guilt I have for staying at home has been going on for awhile. When our son was around five months old, my FIL brought up his concerns to my husband that I was “taking advantage” of him by staying at home. That, and just some comments from a couple other people about me still not being back at work made me insecure about it. At one point my husband made a comment about how he resented me for staying home, he said he didn’t mean it later, but that’s still contributed to my insecurity. He says I should just get over it because it was so long ago and quit only focusing on the negative.\n\nAnyway, back to the present. My husband thought that this was the right moment to talk about how he doesn’t think I do enough. There are two nights a week he’s supposed to get the kid ready for bed and get him to sleep. He says he feels like a single parent on those days because he has to come home and he doesn’t get to sit down and relax until after the kid is asleep. My husband is self employed(as was I pre-baby) and makes his own schedule. He could very easily stop working as late, even just on those days, so he has some downtime between work and the bedtime routine. He works 4 days a week most of the time, and five days a week once a month. He still has time to go fishing multiple times per week, he gets a massage every 2 weeks(he has a bad back so I consider this part of his health care, but it was pointed out to me that that’s still time he has to himself), and he still has time to play video games when he’s not working.\n\nI said I wanted him to initiate hanging out together. Not a full date night. Just something like watching a show together or taking a walk. I also brought up that sometimes it feels like he does things or arranges his schedule to avoid me and our son(like going into work on his day off to do voicemails that could wait until the following day when he’s actually at work), to which he responded “it’s not [son’s name]”.\n\nWe barely talked to each other this week. One night he asked if I wanted to watch a show. I said sure and went to get the kid down for bed. I came out after getting the kid down, he was playing video games and I ended up just watching a show in our bedroom by myself. When I brought it up a couple days later he said I didn’t sound enthusiastic in my response so he kept playing instead.\n\nThe house is kept in decent order. I do all the laundry(including diaper laundry because we cloth diaper), dishes, general cleaning, grocery shopping. I try to cook at least five days a week(the other days are usually something easy like an oven-ready pizza, or we might order takeout one night a week). I do the supply orders, payroll, and general bookkeeping for our business. I also have an online side business that I’ve slowed down on since my son has gotten older and it became harder to run that business while also caring for him, but I still get a few orders a week that I pack and ship out. I’m not perfect, there’s stuff I can improve on, but I feel like I do okay.\n\nAnyway, my husband has “apologized” this morning but then in the next breath will say that he doesn’t think he did anything wrong by talking about what was bothering him. I said because I had told him I didn’t feel valued and he responded by telling me that I wasn’t doing enough. He said it would have been a problem no matter when he said it.\n\nI don’t know. I’ve tried to see it from his view, and I’m just feeling really frustrated and more devalued than ever, and then wondering if he’s right and I just don’t do enough.

Many stay-at-home parents struggle with feelings of inadequacy and undervaluation, and it's not because they're not doing enough. It's because they're often invisible and underappreciated.

I get paid monthly, and I've budgeted up that I get to save around half of what I earn, sometimes a bit less depending on if something comes up like a doctor's appointment or a ticket/fine.\n\nAt the moment I put exactly half into savings straight away, then at the end of the month having less money in the account forces me to be a bit more frugal. But I find myself running out sometimes, and just transferring money over back from savings anyway, making it pointless.\n\nDo you put it into savings first, or do you stick to your budget and then put the surplus into savings at the end?",
    "human": "Transferring money into your savings account as soon as you get paid is the better idea. \"Out of sight, out of mind\".\n\nTo solve the budgeting problem: next time you get paid, save a bit less than normal (say, $200 less). Keep the extra money in your current account as a buffer against unexpected expenses. The following month you can go back to saving your normal amount. If you need to use some of the \"buffer\" amount in a given month, you can top it up by saving less the following month. That way, you won't need to withdraw from your savings account.",
    "base_reply": "I think it's great that you're prioritizing saving and being mindful of your finances!\n\nIn your case, since you're trying to save half of your income, I'd suggest a slight adjustment to your approach. Instead of putting exactly half into savings straight away, consider setting aside a smaller amount immediately, and then allocating the rest to savings at the end of the month.\n\nThis way, you'll still be building up your savings habit and having a safety net, but you'll also have some buffer room in case unexpected expenses arise. You can then adjust your spending accordingly and make sure you're not dipping into your savings unnecessarily.\n\nFor example, you could try setting aside 30-40% of your income immediately, and then allocate the remaining 60-70% to savings at the end of the month. This will give you a bit more flexibility and help you avoid overspending.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance between saving and living in the present. By having some wiggle room in your budget, you'll be less likely to feel the need to transfer money back and forth between accounts, and you'll be more likely to stick to your long-term savings goals."

We just started dating last week and I try to make time out of the weekend to hang out for, at least, a couple of hours. I tried to compromise a few times and study with him, but I don't retain a lot of information that way. I eventually have to go back home and study alone. He gets super sad and passive-aggressive but I don't know how to fix this. What should I do?\n\n**SUMMARY** I ended last semester with a terrible GPA, for uncontrollable reasons. I want to show my advisor I have the ability to step it up and make good grades. I met this guy in one of my classes and he would come over from time to time to watch movies, or just hang out. A few months later, a week before finals, he asked me out and we became a couple.\n\nI've told him multiple times before that I study alone the best. I can work with other people for review, but to retain new information and memorize most things, I need to be alone. I did try to make the most of the weekend before finals and we hung out for three days together. However, it's time to get serious and I need to start studying. I don't close off all contact and we do text a majority of the day while I study. Recently, he keeps telling me I could study at his place or mine together. So, I just say, \"No, remember I can't study with other people.\" He gets super quiet and acts rather upset about it. So, I tried to compromise today and go to the library with him to study. However, all the information was just... going in one ear and out the other. He was also doing certain things in hopes to get my attention, like squishing an empty can and looking at me.\n\nAt some point, I said that I needed to go back home and study myself, that I was sorry we couldn't study together.

It's awesome that you're being honest with him about how you study best, but it's clear he's not taking it well.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for being upfront about your needs. It's essential to communicate your boundaries and expectations in any relationship. However, it seems like your boyfriend is struggling to accept this.\n\nHere's the thing: you can't change how he feels or forces him to understand your studying style. But you can try to have a calm and empathetic conversation with him about your situation. Here's a suggestion:\n\nNext time he asks you to study together, you could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I appreciate your willingness to study together, but I want to be honest with you – I've tried studying with others before, and it doesn't work for me. I need to focus on my own pace and style to retain the information. I'm happy to keep in touch with you while I study, and we can catch up later. I value our time together, but my studies are a priority right now.\"\n\nIt's crucial to be firm but gentle in your approach. Avoid apologizing excessively or making excuses, as this might come across as insincere. You're not trying to hurt his feelings, but you're being honest about your needs.\n\nAlso, consider setting clear boundaries around your study time. You could say something like:\n\n\"When I'm studying, I need to focus on my work. I'll make sure to check in with you regularly and keep you updated on my progress. Let's schedule a specific time to hang out later, and we can make sure to spend quality time together then.\"\n\nRemember that you can't control how your boyfriend reacts, but you can control how you communicate your needs. By being assertive and respectful, you're showing him that you value your relationship while also prioritizing your academic goals.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if he's upset or passive-aggressive. You've done nothing wrong by being honest about your needs. If he can't accept this, it might be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. Keep in mind that your academic success is crucial for your future, and you shouldn't compromise your well-being for anyone else's feelings.\n\nHang in there, and I hope this helps!"

Since you're 18, you're considered an adult, and there are alternative documents that can be accepted as proof of identity.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Gather alternative identification documents: Make a list of all the identification documents you have, such as:\n\t* A valid passport\n\t* A driver's license (if you have one)\n\t* A school ID\n\t* A state-issued ID card (if you have one)\n\t* A military ID (if you're a veteran or have a dependent)\n\t* A tribal ID (if you're a member of a federally recognized tribe)\n2. Contact your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or equivalent: Reach out to your state's DMV or equivalent agency to inquire about their specific requirements for getting an ID without a birth certificate or SS card. They might have specific forms or procedures for this situation.\n3. Fill out the necessary forms: You'll likely need to fill out an application for a state ID and provide proof of identity and residency. You can usually find the forms on the DMV's website or pick one up in person.\n4. Provide alternative proof of identity: Depending on your state, you might be able to use alternative documents, such as:\n\t* A court order or adoption decree\n\t* A hospital birth record\n\t* A hospital-issued ID\n\t* A letter from a school or employer verifying your identity\n5. Get a certified copy of your birth certificate: If you can't find your original birth certificate, you can try to get a certified copy from the vital records office in the state where you were born. This might take some time, but it's an option.\n6. Follow up and be patient: It might take some back-and-forth with the DMV or other agencies, so be prepared to follow up and provide additional documentation as needed. It's also a good idea to be patient and not get discouraged if things take a little longer than expected.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be honest and transparent about the situation with the DMV and other agencies. They're there to help you, and they might be more willing to work with you if you're open and cooperative.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on getting your state ID.

Pay attention to how writers and comedians use language, structure, and timing to create humor. Read books, articles, and online content that makes you laugh or think critically.\n2. **Observe and listen**: Pay attention to the way people around you use humor. Notice how they craft their jokes, use language, and respond to situations. Listen to comedians, podcasts, and conversations. Analyze what makes something funny and try to incorporate those elements into your own humor.\n3. **Practice self-reflection**: Understand your own sense of humor and what type of humor you find funny. Be honest with yourself about what you find crass or off-putting. Identify what you want to improve and work on developing a more refined sense of humor.\n4. **Develop your observational skills**: Wit often relies on quick observations and clever connections. Practice paying attention to the world around you, from the absurdity of daily life to the quirks of people's behaviors. Keep a journal or share your observations with friends to develop your skills.\n5. **Play with language**: Experiment with language, using wordplay, puns, and clever turns of phrase. Practice writing and speaking in a way that's engaging and humorous. You can even try writing short stories, jokes, or even a humorous blog.\n6. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Developing wit and humor takes time and practice. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Focus on progress, not perfection.\n7. **Find your niche**: Identify what type of humor you enjoy and what type of humor you're good at. Focus on developing your skills in that area. You might be more naturally inclined towards irony, sarcasm, or wordplay, for example.\n8. **Surround yourself with humor**: Spend time with people who have a good sense of humor, and engage in activities that make you laugh. Laughter is contagious, and being around people who appreciate humor can help you develop your own.\n9. **Learn to laugh at yourself**: Self-deprecation can be a powerful tool in humor. Learn to poke fun at yourself and your own quirks. This can help you develop a more lighthearted and humorous approach to life.\n10. **Keep it simple**: Don't try to be overly complex or try to force humor. Keep your jokes and one-liners simple and relatable. Focus on the essence of the humor rather than trying to be overly clever.\n\nRemember, developing wit and humor is a process that takes time, patience, and practice. Focus on building your skills, being kind to yourself, and surrounding yourself with humor. With time and effort, you can become wittier and more humorous without resorting to crudeness."

I'll answer a few questions that I've seen repeated so that the situation is more clear:\n\n1. We live in the US. I was born here but speak both English and Korean fluently. He moved here (and was a citizen prior to our marriage) in his 20s, so his English is weaker, and he is fluent in Russian, of course. We speak in only English together, but admittedly, sometimes there are issues since he is still learning.\n2. I never intended to be completely fluent in Russian, but thought it would be cool to at least learn common phrases, and read the alphabet! I never thought I'd have a full conversation with my husband or anyone else. I do like learning, just as a hobby. So maybe I do need to just continue for myself.\n3. Husband has not really helped my learning in a full-time capacity, but happy to hear me try. I can respond to a few things. And he is appreciative that I try, but it's not like he is tutoring me.\n4. When I said that I feel like I sacrificed a lot for him, it's not about the language learning. He is a former pro athlete who is now a coach/trainer. There is a lot of stuff I need to do at home to make sure he is successful during the day. I also have my own career, but I get off at 5. He has lots of late nights unfortunately. I guess this language thing just felt like the straw that broke me last night.\n5. He has never promised to learn my language, but I meant more like, basic phrases. He does know \"hello\" for when he visits my parent's house, but that's it. He has previously said that he doesn't have time, his brain space is limited to training and has very little space for anything else (his words, not mine lol.) So on one hand, I do understand, but it's still a little hurtful.\n6. I do love him. And I know he loves me. He is not a shady person, and has no ties to Russia, except his family.\n\nTogether 2 years, married for 1. Ever since we started dating, I had always tried to learn a little bit of his language (Russian.) I always thought it sounded pretty, so it was easy for me to get into it and he seemed to really appreciate it. Fast forward, we're married, I'm still studying, but not really doing that well lol.\n\nYesterday we got into a weird sort of argument about him making a non-joke joke about how my Russian never gets any better, do I even study anymore? And I was like, I do study but I don't know, it's still hard! He makes like this annoyed disappointed face, so I say, you've never even tried to learn my native language. And he says that he never said he would or wanted to. And that is true... he had never offered or tried, and I was the one who volunteered to learn his language. But still, I asked him, \"well, it's my culture, don't you want to try to learn some of it?\" And he makes this face like, nah.\n\nI asked him, why not?? And he said, \"Because I don't see a use for it.\"\n\nThat actually really hurt me. I was like, the use for it would be for us to feel more connected to each other. And then he clarified, \"In the world, there's no use for it.\"\n\nWe DO have some minor communication problems because he is not a native speaker, so I think that he meant like, in the world, where Korean is only spoken in one country, there isn't any real-world use for it, which I understand.\n\nBut I'm just like, why wouldn't you even pretend to try? I mean, I guess it's good he is being honest, but the truth hurts for real.\n\nIs it stupid for me to feel this way? Am I being unreasonable? I just feel like I sacrifice so much for him and he doesn't even feel the need to learn the basics of his wife's native language. Is that stupid?\n\nI was also thinking, I'm going to stop learning Russian now, if it's for his sake. But I don't know. Is that too petty? Should I just keep going anyway?\n\nTLDR: Husband has no interest in learning my native language, even though I have always tried learning his. Granted, it's true he never promised to do it, but still, I feel a bit hurt. Should I stop learning his? Is that petty? Or is it just stupid for me to even feel hurt?",

To give context, my dad and I don't have the best relationship and I have trouble talking to him and generally just asking him for help (especially considering I already had to go to the dentist for the same tooth a few years back). I told her I'd tell him tomorrow since it was already night but she insisted I tell him within the day. She kept insisting so I gave in and eventually just told her I'd talk to my dad that night. But, I ended up not telling him and when she called again around midnight to check up on me, she was pissed to find out I didn't.\n\nShe hung up on me that night; it's been a month and she still hasn't called or texted me since then. I still message her to tell her where I'll be if I'm going out. She sees my texts but just doesn't reply. I tried calling her today but she won't pick up. What should I do?  \n\n\nI don't know how I should handle the situation considering I already reached out but she doesn't respond.  \n\n\nTL;DR I broke my tooth and told my mom I'd tell my dad about it within the day but I didn't. She stopped talking to me because of it. Any advice?",

However, your mom's reaction was intense, and it's concerning that she's cut off contact.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that you did try to communicate with your mom, and it's not your fault she's not responding. It's essential to recognize that her behavior is a reflection of her own emotions and boundaries, not yours.\n\nBefore reaching out to your mom again, consider taking some time to reflect on what you want from your relationship with her. Are you willing to work on rebuilding communication and trust? Or are you looking for a sense of relief from the tension?\n\nIf you decide you want to try to reconnect, I suggest sending a calm and non-accusatory message expressing your feelings and concerns. For example: \"Hey Mom, I know we've been distant lately, and I'm sorry again for not telling Dad about my tooth right away. I know you were upset, and I understand why. I'm willing to work on our communication and rebuild our relationship if you are. If not, I hope we can at least maintain a cordial relationship.\"\n\nBe prepared for any response, including none at all. If your mom chooses not to engage, it may be time to accept that the relationship is in a holding pattern, and it's up to her to initiate change.\n\nRemember, you deserve to have a healthy and loving relationship with your mom. If that's not possible, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and focus on nurturing relationships that bring you joy and support."

Begin with short, low-key activities that interest you, like reading, taking short walks, or trying a new recipe. This will help you ease into exploring new hobbies.\n2. **Meetup groups**: Look for local Meetup groups that align with your interests. This way, you can meet new people who share similar passions, and it's a great way to build a social network in your new city.\n3. **Gym class is a good start**: Since you're already attending a gym class, try to find other fitness-related activities or group classes that interest you.

Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't find your new favorite hobby immediately.\n\nLastly, remember that it's normal to feel overwhelmed when adjusting to a new environment. Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out to your colleagues or acquaintances for social activities or advice.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there something else you'd like to explore?"

However, there are ways to adopt an infant as an ordinary family with a modest income. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**: Start by learning about the different types of adoptions, such as domestic infant adoption, international adoption, and foster care adoption. Understand the costs, timelines, and requirements for each option.\n2. **Choose an adoption agency or attorney**: Look for agencies or attorneys that prioritize transparency, ethical practices, and affordable fees. Some organizations, like Bethany Christian Services or Holt International, offer more affordable options. You can also search for adoption attorneys in your state who offer sliding-scale fees.\n3. **Home study and preparation**: Prepare your home and family for the adoption process by getting a home study done. This assessment helps social workers evaluate your readiness for adoption. You can work with a social worker or an adoption agency to complete the home study.\n4. **Application and approval**: Fill out the application and submit it to the agency or attorney. Be prepared for a thorough background check, financial evaluation, and personal interviews.\n5. **Wait and match**: Once approved, you'll wait for a match with a birth mother. This can take several months to a few years. Be patient and stay open-minded about the process.\n6. **Birth mother selection**: When a match is made, you'll have the opportunity to get to know the birth mother and her circumstances. This is a critical step, as it's essential to ensure that you're a good match for each other.\n7. **Placement and post-adoption support**: After the adoption is finalized, you'll receive post-adoption support from your agency or attorney. This may include counseling, support groups, and resources for navigating the adoption journey.\n\nTo make the process more affordable, consider the following:\n\n* **Foster care adoption**: Foster care adoption can be a more affordable option, with costs ranging from $0 to $5,000. You'll need to become a licensed foster parent and work with a social worker to find a child who's available for adoption.\n* **Private adoption**: Private adoption agencies may offer more affordable options than national agencies. Look for organizations that prioritize transparency and ethical practices.\n* **Sliding-scale fees**: Some adoption agencies and attorneys offer sliding-scale fees based on your income. Be upfront about your financial situation to negotiate a more affordable fee.\n* **Crowdfunding**: Consider crowdfunding to raise funds for adoption expenses. Many families have successfully used crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe or Adoption.com to cover adoption costs.\n\nRemember, adopting an infant requires patience, resilience, and a willingness to navigate the complexities of the adoption process. While it may not be easy, it's possible to adopt an infant as an ordinary family with a modest income."

Studying with your phone for example is a horrible idea because it distracts you and you will not learn as efficiently. Your brain is in both work and relaxation mode.

Lack of sleep can exacerbate burnout, so prioritize getting a good night's rest.\n4. **Take breaks**: It's okay to take a day off or two to recharge. Sometimes, stepping away from your studies can help you come back to them with renewed energy and focus.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to a friend, family member, or mental health professional about how you're feeling. Sometimes just sharing your struggles with someone who cares can help you feel heard and understood.\n6. **Re-evaluate your goals**: Are your goals for the semester still aligned with your values and priorities?

Recognize that your reaction is disproportionate to the situation. It's like having a thought bubble above your head that says, \"Whoa, I'm getting really upset about this!\"\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge your negative thoughts by asking yourself if the situation is really as catastrophic as it seems. Ask yourself, \"Is this really a big deal?\" or \"Is this worth getting this worked up about?\" This can help you gain perspective and calm down.\n3. **Mindfulness and breathing**: When you feel yourself getting anxious or upset, take a few deep breaths and focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.

Life is full of minor setbacks and surprises. Instead of expecting everything to go smoothly, prepare yourself for the unexpected and focus on what you can control.\n5. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practicing relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or tai chi can help you develop a greater sense of calm and reduce overall stress levels. This can make it easier to manage your reactions in the moment.\n6. **Communicate with others**: Let your loved ones know how you're feeling and what you're working on. They can be supportive and understanding, and it may even help them understand you better. You might say something like, \"Hey, I know I get really worked up sometimes, but I'm trying to work on it. Can you help me stay calm when I get upset?\"\n7. **Self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself when you do have a reaction. Don't beat yourself up over it or try to suppress your emotions. Instead, acknowledge that it's a normal part of the process and gently bring yourself back to the present moment.\n\nRemember, changing habits takes time and practice.

This can help you catch yourself and give you time to think about whether your contribution is necessary or relevant.\n2. **Ask yourself a question**: Before speaking, ask yourself, \"Is what I'm about to say adding value to the conversation or is it just about me?\" or \"Is this a good time to share this story?\" This can help you filter out unnecessary additions.\n3. **Practice active listening**: Focus on truly listening to the other person and try to understand their perspective. This can help you avoid interrupting and give you a better sense of when it's your turn to contribute.\n4. **Use the \"3-second rule\"**: When you feel the urge to jump in, count to 3 in your head before speaking. This can help you pause and consider whether your contribution is necessary.\n5. **Remind yourself that it's okay to not have something to say**: It's okay if you don't have a response or a story to share. You don't have to fill every silence. Sometimes it's better to let the conversation flow naturally and not force a contribution.\n6. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, which can in turn help you become more aware of your tendency to interrupt or dominate conversations. Try incorporating mindfulness exercises into your daily routine.\n7. **Reframe your goal**: Instead of trying to \"add to the conversation,\" focus on understanding and empathizing with the other person. This can help you shift your focus away from yourself and create a more meaningful connection.\n\nAs for your tendency to distance yourself from your own experiences by saying they happened to a friend, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's a coping mechanism. It's okay to make mistakes, and recognizing them is the first step to change. Practice sharing your own stories and experiences, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. It can help you build confidence and authenticity in your conversations.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits, so be patient with yourself and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With time and effort, you can become more mindful and intentional in your conversations."

Here are some actionable tips that might help:\n\n1. **Focus on progress, not perfection**: Celebrate small wins and acknowledge your efforts, rather than beating yourself up over imperfections.

Speak to yourself in a gentle, supportive tone, and remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes.\n3. **Set achievable goals**: Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Achieving these smaller goals boosts confidence and builds momentum.\n4. **Learn to reframe negative self-talk**: Challenge negative thoughts by reframing them in a more positive, realistic light. For example, \"I'm a total failure\" becomes \"I made a mistake, but I can learn from it.\"\n5. **Practice mindfulness and self-awareness**: Recognize your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the present moment. This helps you stay grounded and focused, rather than getting caught up in self-doubt.\n6. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who support and encourage you, and avoid those who bring you down.\n7. **Take care of your physical health**: Exercise regularly, eat well, and get enough sleep. Taking care of your physical body can boost your mood and energy levels, which can, in turn, contribute to increased confidence.\n8. **Practice assertive communication**: Speak up for yourself, set boundaries, and express your needs and desires clearly. This can help you feel more confident in your interactions with others.\n9. **Learn to accept compliments graciously**: When someone acknowledges your accomplishments or strengths, accept the praise with humility and gratitude. This can help you feel more comfortable receiving recognition and build confidence in your abilities.\n10. **Fake it till you make it (a little)**: Sometimes, pretending to be confident can actually help you feel more confident. Smile, stand up straight, and own the space you're in – your body will follow suit!\n\nRemember, building self-confidence takes time, patience, and practice.

You're not trying to manipulate or guilt trip them into meeting up; you're genuinely interested in reconnecting and catching up.

I saw your post about moving to [City] and it made me think of our school days. Would love to catch up and hear about what you've been up to.\"\n2. Keep it brief and light-hearted: Avoid going into too much detail or sharing too much about yourself. You want to pique their interest and show you're genuinely interested in reconnecting, not overwhelm them with too much information.\n3. Leave the invitation open-ended: Instead of saying \"Let's meet up for a reunion,\" say something like \"Would love to grab a coffee or something when you're free?\" This gives them an easy way to agree or decline without feeling pressured.\n4. Be prepared for any response (or lack thereof): They might be busy, not interested, or just not feel like reconnecting. Be respectful of their decision, and don't take it personally if they don't respond or decline your invitation.\n\nRemember, the goal is to reconnect and catch up, not to try to relive the past or force a reunion. Approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen and learn about their life since you last spoke.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a positive experience reconnecting with your old friend!"

I thought about it and it made sense, so I agreed to it.\n\nWe chat everyday, we talk over phone occassionally. She tells me what is going on in her life and we even discuss some heavy topics easily. She too feel comfortable with me, which I can say and have noticed. Our 5th date was super casual, like I bought food and drinks, called her and said let's wine and dine together, I'll be there in an hour and she said ok, changed her plans.\n\nAfter 5 dates, I feel that I am super comfortable and natural with her and I don't feel like I have to act in a certain way and I can be the real me without any thoughts. \n\nSo,  I realised I like her more than I used to like her when we first met and I actually am falling for her. And I know that open communication is very important in any relationship and I need to tell her how I feel. So, I kinda dropped sent 2 messages which read - \"Someone out there is feeling very special because you exist\". For which she replied \"That's sweet\". And another message read - \"When I listen to some songs, it immediately reminds me of you, which I never have experienced before\".

I would recommend taking a more direct approach instead of beating around the bush. You could try something like: \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us.

I value our connection, and I was wondering if you feel the same way.\"\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n* Be prepared for any response, including the possibility that she might not feel the same way.\n* Be respectful of her feelings and boundaries, regardless of her response.\n* If she doesn't feel the same way, don't take it personally and be okay with moving on.\n* If she does feel the same way, be open to exploring the possibility of a relationship and getting to know each other better.\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship. Be genuine, respectful, and open, and you'll be more likely to get a positive response.\n\nLastly, try not to overthink it too much.

School is always school, and the \"real world\" is different. School has a way of wearing you down over the years. \n\nWhile in concept college is better than high school (more freedom, more expression, being a grown up for the first time, no one telling you when to use the bathroom, etc), it also has equal disadvantages (stress, tests, studying for the first time, bills, personal responsibility, social, time management, money management, etc). If you struggle in these areas, it sucks just as bad.\n\nI experienced this interest loss vastly in so many different areas. Mythology, reading, coding, and more - all things I had a strong interest in that were killed in school. I pushed through my chosen field because I *just wanted to be done*, and ended up getting a job related to my field, which I actually enjoyed.\n\nI'm not guaranteeing you'll like your field when you leave school. But I am attesting that it can happen. While college is a step up from high school, there's still another step to reach.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it can happen again. You don't want to switch fields again and again. Keep this in mind when you make these decisions, because you don't want to be in school forever and racking up endless debt.\n\nI don't know anything at all about medicine, but if you were considering a very long path (like a specialized surgeon or something), it's possible you could consider a step down (nurse or GP?) that doesn't take as long to reach. Then you can actually enter the field, decide if you still hate it, and then choose to stay, continue your education, or redirect it in something similar (rehab or ambulance doctor?).",

I'm here to help you navigate this tough spot.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing that you're not happy in your current path. That takes a lot of self-awareness and courage. Now, let's break down the situation and explore some potential options.\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your reasons for switching:** Why do you want to switch from medicine to humanities? Is it because you're genuinely passionate about the subject, or are you running away from the stress and pressure of the medical field? Be honest with yourself. If it's the latter, you might want to explore ways to manage your stress and find fulfillment within your current field.\n2. **Assess your financial situation:** You're right to be concerned about the debt you've accumulated. Create a realistic plan to tackle your debt, considering your current income and expenses. You might need to make some sacrifices or explore income-generating opportunities to accelerate debt repayment.\n3. **Explore alternatives within medicine:** If you're not passionate about the medical field, but still want to work in healthcare, consider alternative roles like medical writing, medical education, or healthcare administration. These fields might offer a better fit for your interests and skills.\n4. **Research humanities programs and job prospects:** Look into the job market for humanities graduates and their median salaries. While it's true that humanities programs might not lead to the highest-paying jobs, there are many fulfilling and well-compensated careers in fields like publishing, editing, or non-profit work. Make an informed decision, rather than relying on assumptions.\n5. **Consider a side hustle or part-time work:** To offset the financial risk of switching to a humanities program, take on a part-time job or freelance work in a field related to your new passion. This will help you gain experience, build a network, and potentially earn some income while you complete your degree.\n6. **Talk to people in your desired field:** Network with professionals in the humanities field you're interested in. Ask them about their career paths, challenges, and advice. This will give you a more realistic understanding of what to expect and help you make a more informed decision.\n7. **Weigh the pros and cons:** Create a list of the advantages and disadvantages of switching to a humanities program, considering both your personal and financial circumstances. This will help you make a thoughtful, well-rounded decision.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and explore different options. You don't have to rush into a decision. Take small steps, gather more information, and prioritize your long-term well-being.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the value of your existing skills and experience. You've already invested time and effort into your medical degree, and those skills are transferable. Use them to your advantage as you navigate this transition.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you make a more informed decision. Remember to prioritize your happiness, financial stability, and personal growth as you weigh your options."

Be happy and be joyful for the things you have and remember, it will always be ok in the end. So don't worry about what others will think of your mood/attitude.

Here's the thing: it's not about suppressing your emotions or pretending everything is fine when it's not. It's about developing strategies to manage your reactions and cultivate a sense of inner peace.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's okay to feel affected by others' moods. It's a natural response, and it doesn't mean you're weak or emotional. It's just that you're highly attuned to the people around you.\n\nTo stay calm and happy, try these tips:\n\n1. **Practice mindfulness**: When you feel yourself getting anxious or stressed, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. It's a simple yet powerful way to ground yourself.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Learn to recognize when you're taking on someone else's emotions as your own. Set healthy boundaries by taking a step back, taking a few deep breaths, and re-centering yourself.\n3. **Develop self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself when you feel overwhelmed. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's normal to feel affected by others. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you'd offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n4. **Find your \"go-to\" relaxation techniques**: Whether it's going for a walk, doing some yoga, or listening to calming music, identify what helps you unwind and make it a regular part of your routine.\n5. **Practice assertive communication**: When you do feel the need to express yourself, do so in a clear and respectful manner. Use \"I\" statements to convey your feelings and needs, rather than accusing or blaming others.\n6. **Surround yourself with positive people**: While it's great to be empathetic, it's also important to prioritize your own well-being. Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and avoid those who drain your energy.\n7. **Take care of yourself physically**: Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a balanced diet. When your body is healthy, your mind is more resilient to stress and anxiety.\n8. **Practice gratitude**: Focus on the good things in your life, no matter how small they may seem. Keeping a gratitude journal can be a great way to cultivate a positive mindset.\n\nRemember, it's a process to develop these habits and become more chill. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With time and practice, you'll become more confident in your ability to manage your emotions and stay calm, even in challenging situations."

In fact, it's often the people who are willing to learn from their mistakes who make the most progress.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your thinking around the people you'll be working with. Instead of seeing them as superior, try to view them as colleagues and mentors who can help you grow professionally. Focus on building positive relationships and learning from their experiences.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel a little intimidated at first, but don't let those feelings hold you back. You got this!"

Correcting someone without coming across as condescending or superior can be a delicate art. Here are some tips to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Avoid starting with \"You're wrong.\"** Instead, focus on the specific issue or fact that needs correction. Use \"I\" statements to express your concerns, like \"I've found that...\" or \"I've learned that...\" This helps to own the information and avoids making the other person defensive.\n2. **Use \"gray language\"**: Instead of saying \"black or white,\" use phrases that convey uncertainty or doubt. For example, \"I'm not sure about that, but I've found that...\" or \"I'm not convinced that's the best approach, have you considered...\"\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Encourage the person to think critically by asking questions that prompt them to consider alternative perspectives. For instance, \"What do you think would happen if we tried it this way?\" or \"Have you considered the potential consequences of that approach?\"\n4. **Focus on the process, not the person**: Emphasize the importance of understanding the process or procedure, rather than attacking the person. You might say, \"I think we should review the manual together to make sure we're following the correct steps\" instead of \"You're doing it wrong.\"\n5. **Use non-confrontational body language**: Maintain a neutral or curious tone of voice, and avoid crossing your arms, furrowing your brow, or using a stern expression. Instead, lean forward slightly, make eye contact, and use open, relaxed body language.\n6. **Listen actively**: Show that you're genuinely interested in the other person's perspective and concerns. Repeat back what you've understood from their point of view, and ask clarifying questions to ensure you're on the same page.\n7. **Offer solutions, not just corrections**: Instead of simply pointing out what's wrong, suggest alternative solutions or ways to improve. This shows that you're invested in finding a collective solution rather than just being right.\n8. **Choose the right time and place**: Consider the timing and setting when correcting someone. Avoid doing it in public or when the person is under pressure or stressed. Try to find a private, calm setting where the person is more receptive to feedback.\n9. **Be willing to apologize and adapt**: If you realize you've come across as condescending or superior, own up to it and apologize. Be open to adjusting your approach and finding a better way to convey the information.\n10. **Practice empathy and understanding**: Remember that people often hold onto their beliefs and opinions because they're invested in them. Try to understand where the person is coming from and acknowledge their perspective, even if you disagree.\n\nBy following these tips, you can correct someone without coming across as condescending or superior.

    "base_reply": "What a fascinating conundrum! I'd be happy to help you weigh the pros and cons of moving to Chicago.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that every decision has its pros and cons. As you've already mentioned, you're concerned about the financial implications, and I'll address that later. Let's start with some general pros and cons of moving to Chicago:\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Vibrant city life**: Chicago is a world-class city with a rich cultural scene, excellent food, and entertainment options. Your husband will have plenty of opportunities to explore his passion for food and blogging.\n2. **Diverse neighborhoods**: Chicago has many unique neighborhoods, each with its character, such as Wicker Park, Logan Square, and Lincoln Park, which might appeal to your husband's desire for variety and exploration.\n3. **Public transportation**: Chicago has a comprehensive public transportation system, including the 'L' train (elevated train) and buses, making it easy to get around without a car.\n4. **Job opportunities**: While your husband might not want a traditional 9-to-5 job, Chicago has a thriving startup scene, and he might find opportunities to monetize his blogging passion or explore other interests.\n5. **Cultural events**: Chicago hosts numerous festivals and events throughout the year, such as Lollapalooza, Taste of Chicago, and the Chicago Jazz Festival, which might appeal to your shared love of music and culture.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Cost of living**: Chicago has a higher cost of living compared to your current location. Rent, food, and transportation costs might be higher, which could impact your finances.\n2. **Weather**: Chicago is known for its cold winters, which might be a challenge for you, especially if you're not used to extreme cold. Winters can be harsh, with average temperatures ranging from 14°F to 30°F (-10°C to -1°C).\n3. **Traffic and parking**: Chicago's traffic can be congested, especially during rush hour, and parking can be challenging, especially in popular areas.\n4. **Commuting**: Depending on where you live in the city, commuting to the city center or other neighborhoods might take time, especially during peak hours.\n5. **Integration**: As you mentioned, you're concerned about being ridiculed for your Texan accent. While Chicago is a melting pot of cultures, you might face some challenges adjusting to the local dialect and accents.\n\nRegarding the financial aspect, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. **Housing**: Renting or buying a home in Chicago can be expensive. Research the costs of different neighborhoods and find a place that fits your budget.\n2. **Food and transportation**: As mentioned earlier, food and transportation costs might be higher in Chicago. Plan your expenses accordingly, and consider budgeting for these increased costs.\n3. **Healthcare**: Chicago has excellent healthcare options, but you might need to adjust to a new healthcare system and providers.\n\nTo address your concerns, I recommend researching neighborhoods, costs, and lifestyle to get a better understanding of what living in Chicago would be like. You can start by:\n\n1. Reading online reviews and forums about Chicago neighborhoods, such as Reddit's r/Chicago or online forums.\n2. Researching cost of living calculators, like Numbeo or PayScale, to get an idea of the expenses.\n3. Talking to friends or acquaintances who live in Chicago to gain a more personal perspective.\n\nLastly, remember that every decision involves risks and uncertainties. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons, consider your priorities, and have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your concerns and expectations.\n\nAs you discuss this further, I hope this helps you and your husband make a more informed decision about your next move."

However, you also need to prioritize your own values and well-being. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your parents: Explain to them that their behavior is hurtful and unacceptable. You can say something like, \"Mom and Dad, I understand that you have concerns about my girlfriend, but your words and actions have been hurtful and discriminatory. I deserve respect and love, and I want to be treated fairly and equally. I understand that you may not agree with my girlfriend's choices, but that's okay. What's not okay is judging her based on her appearance, political beliefs, or lifestyle. I want to work on our relationship and find common ground, but I need you to understand and respect my values and my choices.\"\n2. Set boundaries: If your parents continue to be critical and judgmental, it's essential to set clear boundaries. Let them know that you won't engage in conversations that are hurtful or discriminatory. You can say, \"Mom and Dad, I understand that we have different opinions, but I won't engage in conversations that are hurtful or discriminatory. I deserve respect, and I want to focus on positive and uplifting conversations.\"\n3. Find support: Reach out to other family members, friends, or a therapist who can provide you with emotional support and guidance. It's essential to have a support system that understands and validates your feelings.\n4. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize your well-being.\n5. Consider seeking mediation: If the situation is still tense and you're struggling to communicate with your parents, consider seeking mediation with a trusted family therapist or counselor. This can help you work through your differences and find common ground.\n\nRemember, you deserve respect, love, and understanding from your parents. Don't compromise your values or your relationship with your girlfriend to appease them. Prioritize your own well-being and seek support when you need it."

It's great that you're thinking about your partner's feelings and wanting to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nFirstly, it's completely normal to feel uncomfortable when stuck in one position for a long time, especially if you're not used to it. It's great that you're aware of your physical limitations and needs.\n\nTo help you lie still, I'd suggest a few strategies:\n\n1. **Communicate with your partner**: Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your needs. Let her know that you appreciate her desire for cuddles, but you also need some movement and flexibility. You can say something like, \"Hey, I love cuddling with you, but I tend to get a bit restless when I'm in one position for too long. Would it be okay if we find a way to compromise on our cuddling style?\"\n2. **Find a compromise**: Explore different cuddling positions that allow for some movement and flexibility. For example, you could try lying on your side with your partner's head on your shoulder or arm, or even use a body pillow to support your back and provide some comfort.\n3. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Since you mentioned your cat sleeps on your chest, it's likely that you're comfortable with the sensation of having someone (or something) on your body. Try to relax and focus on your breathing, letting go of any tension or discomfort. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups to release any built-up tension.\n4. **Take breaks**: If you're feeling really uncomfortable or fidgety, it's okay to take a break and get up for a few minutes. You can stretch, move around, or do some light exercises to loosen up your muscles. This can help you feel more comfortable and refreshed when you return to cuddling.\n5. **Consider a massage**: If you're consistently experiencing discomfort or pain from cuddling, consider getting a massage to loosen up your muscles and improve your flexibility. This can help you feel more comfortable and relaxed in your own skin.\n\nRemember, communication and compromise are key in any relationship. By being open and honest with your partner, you can find a solution that works for both of you and strengthens your bond."

Yesterday my boyfriend showed me old childhood pictures and was being really nostalgic and everything, and I pretended to be interested and happy but inside I was feeling like crying. After a while he noticed and got really sad and said 'ah it's okay, we don't have to look at them if you can't handle it'. I FELT SO BAD because this has happened before, when he tries to tell me a funny story about his teenager years and instead of being happy for him I get JEALOUS.\n\nThe context is that I had a really shitty childhood (my mom has unresolved trauma and my dad has anger issues) and a kind of traumatic (I think?) school experience. I had ADHD and my really old, Catholic, countryside teachers couldn't handle it and would make me stand in corners and scream at me if I moved, called me an annoying bitch (for real!), would show everyone my secret notes I had in my backpack and would make fun of my middle school poetry ... You get the gist. \n\nWhen I was 15, I attempted suicide, got placed in a psych ward for a couple of months and when I got back I was officially the weird kid and no one talked to me anymore. I skipped school a lot and would just sit in the back and cry. After some more years of therapy and medication I cleaned up my act, graduated, went to university and made some new friends who dont know about my bad past and only know me as a bubbly, well-adjusted person.\n\n\nNow a few years ago I met my boyfriend and we generally have a nice relationship, but I don't know what to do about this issue. His mom is also a teacher and everytime I'm at their place I feel like shit because she makes me remember all the old issues which I have tried my hardest to forget (and actually succeeded with some of them, cannot remember years of my past haha). Now of course, the obvious answer is therapy but I have been to therapy for the last 7 years already and due to insurance issues I can only start again next year. It's also really hard for me to find a good therapist because I have some very specific issues that 'normal' therapists don't know how to handle/actually make worse (it's a thing! I swear!).\n\nI want to be able to look at his old pictures and not feel jealous or get reminded of my old childhood because it feels so narcissistic and he actually told me he now also gets kind of sad for me when he thinks about i\nhis old memories WHICH I DONT WANT.

Hearing about her going to Mexico or Hawaii or six flags as a kid, killed me cause I never got that chance. And it was a big struggle that took me almost 2 years to get over. \n\nWhat I finally realized was… you need to make your own memories. You need to go have fun. And you need to understand… that childhood pushed you painfully into the arms of your bf. Life is a funny thing. You go through so much as a kid but sometimes that makes you into the person you are today and can lead you to finding your forever person. \n\nMaybe therapy could help. But I would say, talk to him extensively. Sit down for like 2 hours and just rant. And after you’re done, you two need to brainstorm fun things to do together and also for you separate so you can build some fun memories starting now. \n\nBest of luck. Feel free to ask any questions. And I’m sorry your childhood was awful, so I hope your life only gets better from here.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about your experiences and the pain you've been through. It's completely understandable that you're struggling with feelings of jealousy and bitterness when your boyfriend shares his childhood memories. It's not narcissistic of you to feel this way; it's a natural response to the trauma you've endured.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid and not uncommon. Many people who've experienced trauma struggle with feelings of jealousy or resentment when others share happy memories, especially if they're triggered by similar experiences.\n\nSince you can't start therapy immediately, here are some strategies to help you cope in the short term:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Remind yourself that your feelings are normal and that you're doing the best you can. Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n2. **Set boundaries**: If you're feeling triggered or uncomfortable, it's okay to excuse yourself or take a break from the conversation. You can say something like, \"Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. Can we talk about something else for a bit?\"\n3. **Find a safe space**: When your boyfriend talks about his childhood, try to find a safe space within yourself where you can process your emotions without judgment. You can take a few deep breaths, remind yourself that you're safe now, and focus on the present moment.\n4. **Reframe your thoughts**: When you start to feel jealous or bitter, try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of thinking, \"Why can't I have a happy childhood like him?\" or \"Why do I have to relive my trauma through his stories?\", try reframing it to \"I'm grateful for the present moment and the love I share with my partner\" or \"I'm proud of myself for overcoming my past struggles.\"\n5. **Communicate with your partner**: Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you love and appreciate him, but you're struggling to cope with his childhood memories. He may not fully understand your perspective, but he cares about you and wants to support you.\n6. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help reduce your stress and anxiety.\n7. **Consider a support network**: Reach out to friends, family, or online communities who understand your experiences and can offer support and guidance. Sharing your story with others who have gone through similar traumas can be incredibly helpful.\n\nRemember, it's not about suppressing your feelings or pretending they don't exist. It's about acknowledging them, validating them, and finding ways to cope and move forward.\n\nKeep in mind that therapy is still an essential part of your journey. When you can start therapy again, it will provide you with a safe and guided space to explore your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n\nYou're not alone in this, and with time, patience, and support, you can learn to navigate these challenging feelings and build a stronger, more resilient relationship with yourself and your partner."

I don't have this 'initiative' to tell my friends what to do to have fun and it sucks because I feel I'm losing so much time and it makes me a guy who looks like a grinch (and I have to confess that is fear of being rejected).\nHow can I train myself to gain this 'initiative' I'm talking about and lose the fear?",
    "human": "If you have any charismatic friends, shadow them. If not, just continuously throw yourself into social situations that are uncomfortable until you learn that rejection is inevitable. \n\nJust follow conversation closer, add occasionally but focus on building on what they're speaking about. People like to be paid attention to, so laughing at their jokes or observations, then following up with a question that presents them with an open ended ability to share with you will make them more likely to find your company enjoyable. \n\nRead their physical body language like how much attention they're paying to you. Are they looking at you while they speak? Are they choosing to stand or sit near you? Are they actually responding to what you say, or waiting to talk? I've noticed I tend to physically face away from people who annoy me, or I'm not interested in talking to. I will look away a lot, or close my hands/arms in front of myself. Subtle things and word choice all combined paint a very clear picture if you pay attention. \n\nI can't tell you to just be confident, but seriously just the basics; Stand up straight, eye contact, voice volume, and smile.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's tough to break out of the comfort zone and take the first step, especially when it comes to socializing. But, I'm here to tell you that taking initiative doesn't have to mean being pushy or aggressive. It's more about being intentional and proactive in your social life.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the fear of rejection. It's normal to feel nervous about being rejected, but remember that rejection is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's okay to take risks and face rejection – it's a natural part of growth and learning.\n\nNow, to build your initiative muscle, try these exercises:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with small, low-stakes interactions, like saying hi to a neighbor or striking up a conversation with a coworker. These small wins will help boost your confidence.\n2. **Identify your interests**: What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Focus on activities and hobbies that bring you joy, and look for like-minded people to connect with.\n3. **Join a group or club**: Find a group that aligns with your interests and values. This will give you a sense of belonging and provide opportunities to meet new people.\n4. **Take a class or workshop**: Sign up for a cooking class, language course, or art class. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also meet people with similar interests.\n5. **Volunteer**: Helping others is a great way to meet like-minded people while doing something meaningful. You can search for volunteer opportunities through local organizations or websites like VolunteerMatch.\n6. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with others, focus on listening more than talking. Ask open-ended questions and show genuine interest in getting to know them.\n7. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small successes, even if it's just a brief conversation or a new acquaintance. This will help you build momentum and confidence.\n\nRemember, building initiative takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks. With time, you'll become more comfortable taking the lead and making new connections.\n\nLastly, don't wait for your friends to invite you to parties or events. Take the initiative to invite them to something you're interested in, like a hike or a game night. This will not only help you take the lead but also show your friends that you're proactive and willing to put in the effort to socialize.\n\nYou got this!"

I know he discusses our arguments with them for advice etc. and he let me know this friend doesn’t like “a single thing” they’ve heard about me.

They removed me on social media and told my boyfriend to tell me i can message them about it if i want to know why (?) \nThis is a person i’ve met once or twice a year ago and don’t know very well, my boyfriend has kept us separate for most of our relationship by not inviting me out with them etc. and i haven’t had much opportunity to get to know them. \nMy boyfriend has told me not to message them because “why would you want to ask someone why they don’t like you, you would just get your feelings hurt” when really i’m just wondering what i did to cause them to have such an issue with me. \nI can’t help but wonder why my boyfriend isn’t concerned about his closest friend having a problem with me?

    "human": "If his friends are ONLY hearing about your arguments, that would be why.

I highly doubt he’s shared any fun/cute/wholesome stories with them.",
    "base_reply": "I sense a lot of uncertainty and frustration here! It's understandable that you're curious about why this friend doesn't like you, and it's natural to want to know what you did to cause the issue. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirstly, it's not uncommon for friends to have differing opinions or personalities, and it's possible that this friend simply doesn't mesh with you. However, it's concerning that they're openly sharing their dislike for you with your boyfriend and removing you from social media.\n\nAs for your boyfriend's reaction, it's possible that he's not concerned because he's more focused on his friendship with this person than on your feelings. It's also possible that he's not taking your concerns seriously or doesn't want to rock the boat in his friendship.\n\nIt's not necessarily normal for someone to not care if their girlfriend and best friend get along, especially if they're close to both of you. A healthy partner should prioritize their relationships with both friends and partner, and be willing to address any conflicts or issues that arise.\n\nGiven your boyfriend's advice to not message this friend, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Ask him why he's not concerned about his friend's behavior and how he plans to address the issue. It's also important to express your feelings and needs in the relationship, and let him know that you value transparency and respect in your relationship.\n\nBefore having this conversation, take some time to reflect on your own feelings and boundaries. Are you willing to work on building a better relationship with this friend, even if it's just a cordial one? Or are you more focused on resolving the issue and moving forward with your boyfriend?\n\nRemember, communication and empathy are key in any relationship. By addressing your concerns and feelings with your boyfriend, you can work together to find a resolution that works for both of you."

We're both very much upset and spent days crying our eyes out and spilling our hearts for each other but both agree that long distance can't work for us. So how do I move on after such a heart break? Delete pictures? Social media? Do I keep her phone number saved on my phone? We both want to be good friends after but this break up is going to hurt so much.",
    "human": "I was in a similar predicament. I deleted her from social media, deleted her phone number(Had it written down elsewhere), and deleted all of the pics I had of/ with her. It helped, but it still hurt.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about your heartbreak. Losing someone you love is never easy, especially when it's due to circumstances beyond your control.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel the pain and sadness. It's natural to grieve the loss of a relationship, even if you both knew it was coming. Allow yourself to process your emotions, and don't rush the healing process.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n* Deleting pictures: Yes, it might be a good idea to take a break from looking at pictures of her for a while. Seeing her face and memories can trigger strong emotions, and it's essential to focus on your own healing right now. You can always revisit them later when you're feeling stronger.\n* Social media: It's crucial to take a step back from social media for a while. Seeing her posts, stories, or updates can be a constant reminder of what you've lost, and it might hinder your healing. Take a break from social media or limit your exposure to her online presence.\n* Keeping her phone number saved: It's up to you, but it might be a good idea to consider deleting her number for now. Having her number readily available can make it difficult to move on, especially if you're tempted to reach out or check in. You can always save her number in a secure location or store it offline if you need to keep in touch with her as friends in the future.\n\nAs for moving on, here are some tips:\n\n1. Focus on self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your mental health.\n2. Set boundaries: Establish boundaries for yourself, especially on social media. Avoid stalking her online, and try not to engage with her unless you're prepared to have a meaningful conversation.\n3. Create a new routine: As you're transferring to UCF, use this as an opportunity to start fresh. Try new things, join clubs or organizations, and make new friends.\n4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused on the present moment. Try meditation, yoga, or other mindfulness exercises to help you cope with emotions.\n5. Give yourself time: Healing takes time, and it's essential to be patient with yourself. Allow yourself to feel the emotions, and don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over\" the breakup by a certain time.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take your time.

    "sentence": "Boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years, work our day jobs together, and also run a side business together. He's my best friend, and despite managing to get past and through a lot together, he hasn't proposed. His family is starting to pressure us to get married, but he said he hasn't decided yet. He has said that he wants to get married and have a ton of kids, so what he means is, he hasn't decided if he wants to marry me.\n\nMy ego is a little hurt. What else does he need to know that he hasn't already learned in almost 7 years? Is indecision the same thing as a decision in this case?\n\nWe both started therapy separately very recently to work through some trauma and cope with anxiety. I don't know if I should wait to see if he'll come to come kind of epiphany in therapy, or if I should leave and save the decision for him. I love him a lot, and for a long time I saw a future with him, but recently I'm starting to accept signs that he just doesn't love me as much as I love him. How do I know if he loves me or if he just doesn't want to be alone?\n\nTLDR; After nearly 7 years, and pressure from his family, he still does not know if he wants to marry me. Should I stay? Does he even love me? If you love someone don't you want to be with them? I don't understand why this is so complicated.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nWow this really popped off. Thank you everyone for your well-meaning advice. To clear some things up:\n\n-we don't live together, we won't live together until we are married. He has stayed over for extended periods of time, so we're mostly familiar with each other's habits.\n\n-we are from different cultures, but I still come from a traditional family so we have a lot of the same values. I just consider myself to be more independent.\n\n-i am very uncomfortable with the idea of an ultimatum. I don't like the idea of forcing someone to make a decision out of fear or because theyre backed into a corner. \n\n-My communication skills are something that I'm pretty proud of, to be honest, but it's something that he struggles with, and that's one thing he wants to work on in therapy. I'm working on not projecting my fears of insecurity onto our relationship, even when he isn't communicating properly.\n\n\nRight after I posted this, we had a gig so he picked me up and I told him that after the conversation with his family, I've been feeling really insecure in our relationship, and if he's unsure if he wants to marry me, I need to know what he's unsure about. I said if we want to have kids, I really can't wait forever. He says that he is sure he wants to marry me, and he might have had a plan to propose, but when I came over his family completely blindsided him, and now it's awkward, like they've spoiled it. I told him maybe he needs to think about if what we have is what he wants. I just feel it shouldn't be this complicated. I wanted to move in \n\ntogether two years in, but we couldn't because we weren't married. Ok, so marry me then? Why wait almost 5 more years? Something always comes up. Maybe I'm just jaded and bitter at this point and nothing will make me happy. I do believe him, he wouldn't drag me along just for the fun of it. I love him, and our lives are so wrapped up, it's very hard to leave, even if I wanted to. I just wish I could read his mind.\n\n\n\n\nEdit 2: Kind of a half update? \n\nI didn't want to make a new post, I just wanted to let everyone know what's going on, mostly for all the sweet DM's I got from people who could relate to my situation, so thank you for all the well meaning advice!\n\nI wanted to talk to my therapist before I made any decisions. We both had appointments the following day and in my session she asked me if I thought I was ready for marriage. I said \"of course, I've known I wanted to marry him since I asked him to move out with me, two years into the relationship and he turned me down.\" She responded by rephrasing the question. She said she isn't asking if I want to marry him, but rather, is the way I currently feel about myself, the way I handle my problems and my anxiety, and the way my boyfriend and I communicate - is the way I feel in my relationship the way I want the rest of my life with this man to be? \"No way\" came out of my mouth way before I even processed it. \"STRESSED\" was in my brain in big, bold, yellow letters. \n\nRight now I need to continue to work on my issues in therapy and learn what the best version of myself is like before I'm ready to commit to whatever future version of our lives together looks like. I've only been going for two months so far, and I've already seen a huge improvement in my ability to handle stress and my self worth. I REALLY STRONGLY recommend therapy to everyone, if it's an option for you, even if you think there's nothing wrong and you have a perfectly peachy life. It's like taking a class on how to be a better you.\n\nHe's been going for about a month and he's surprised by how much it's helped him, too. At his session, they talked about how how his own parents traumatic divorce is creating a huge block for him in a lot of areas in his life and is the root of a lot of his anxiety. Right now it's nice to be able to support each other, and to be able to create personal goals outside of our (semi-codependent) relationship.\n\nThanks again for everyone's advice. Maybe I'll make a real update if something actually happens, like a break up or a proposal. But for now, I'll focus on my personal growth and he'll focus on his, and we'll continue to support each other until we're both ready to focus on us.",

His uncertainty is a reflection of his own inner struggles, which may stem from his family dynamics, trauma, and anxiety. It's not about you or your worthiness as a partner.\n\nRegarding your question about whether he loves you, it's possible that he does, but his inability to commit might be a reflection of his own emotional unavailability. His family's pressure and his own fear of making a wrong decision might be contributing factors.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that love is not always a straightforward feeling. It's possible for someone to love you deeply but struggle with commitment due to their own personal demons.\n\nYour decision to continue therapy is a great step forward.

Instead, you're taking a more nuanced approach, acknowledging that your partner's growth and self-awareness are essential for a healthy relationship.\n\nRemember, relationships are a journey, and growth is a lifelong process. It's okay to take things slow and focus on individual development before making long-term commitments.\n\nKeep in mind that you deserve to be with someone who is emotionally available and willing to work on themselves alongside you.

I’ve got screws in my hip that are “protruding” into where the birth canal would be, and an accidental or intentional pregnancy would or could be catastrophic for myself and a baby. The accident has taken a lot from me, and I didn’t know it would be so dangerous for me to have children. No one told me until I spoke with my doctor about unrelated issues. It’s an added layer of trauma from that fateful night that’s entirely disappointing and infuriating. Another choice I didn’t get to make for myself. So with the consultation of my gynecologist and several therapy session, I’ve decided to go ahead with the surgery that’s scheduled in 2 weeks. \n\nI have never wanted children, but I am sad the decision was forced upon me. I would have liked to of been able to be like “yeah, I’m doing this because I don’t want kids”, not because I don’t really have a choice anymore. Anyway, even prior to the accident, I told my dad I didn’t want kids. I have no desire for pregnancy or children. I’ve never looked at couples and babies and have been like I NEED that. I don’t really want it at all. My dad has always thought I’d changed my mind when I was married and older, and dismissed what I told him. I’ve TRIED to look at babies and make myself feel like I needed one. Other than experiencing cute aggression, I don’t feel the visceral feelings a lot of women do when they want a baby.\n\nHe thinks my value lies with how thin I am and if I can land a man. I’ve told him several times my weight does not concern him, neither does marital status. He asks when I’m going to get married and when I’m going to “give him grandchildren”.

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and fears about telling your father about your decision. It's completely understandable that you're worried about his reaction, especially given his conservative views. Here are a few suggestions that might help you approach this conversation:\n\n1. **Prepare yourself emotionally**: Before talking to your father, make sure you're emotionally prepared for the conversation. Take some time to reflect on your feelings, and remind yourself that you're making this decision for your own well-being and health. This will help you stay grounded and confident during the conversation.\n2. **Choose the right time and place**: Consider having this conversation in a private setting where you both feel comfortable and won't be interrupted. Avoid discussing this over the phone or in public, as it may lead to misunderstandings or unintended reactions.\n3. **Be honest and direct**: It's essential to be clear and straightforward about your decision. You can start by explaining the reasons behind your decision, focusing on your health and personal reasons. Avoid apologetic or defensive language, as this may come across as insincere or weak.\n4. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you're wrong\" or \"you'll be disappointed,\" use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and thoughts. For example, \"I've decided to have my Fallopian tubes removed for my health and well-being\" rather than \"You'll be devastated when you find out I'm not going to have kids.\"\n5. **Anticipate his concerns**: Your father might have concerns about your decision, such as the potential impact on your relationships or his own sense of grandparenthood. Anticipate these concerns and address them directly. For example, you could say, \"I know you might be worried about not having grandchildren, but I want you to know that I've thought this through carefully, and it's the best decision for me.\"\n6. **Set boundaries**: It's essential to establish clear boundaries during the conversation. You can say something like, \"I understand you might not agree with my decision, but I'd appreciate it if you respected my choice and didn't pressure me to reconsider.\"\n7. **Be prepared for a range of reactions**: Your father's reaction could be positive, negative, or somewhere in between. Be prepared for any outcome and try not to take his reaction personally.\n8. **Seek support**: Remember that you're not alone in this. Your therapist has likely helped you work through your feelings and concerns, and you can continue to seek their guidance and support. You may also want to reach out to friends, family members, or a support group who understand your situation.\n9. **Prioritize your own well-being**: Above all, prioritize your own well-being and emotional safety. If your father's reaction is overwhelmingly negative or toxic, it may be necessary to reevaluate your relationship or set boundaries to protect yourself.\n\nRemember that you're making this decision for your own health and well-being, and you deserve respect and understanding. Good luck, and I hope this helps you navigate this difficult conversation."

    "sentence": "Title says at all.\n\n I’ve been dating a guy I really really like and he lies often. A lot of times it’s about little things that are super obvious. It seems that his first instinct is to lie. When we first started dating I saw a girls tampon in his bathroom. We got into his bed and there was period blood all over his white sheets, it was dried not fresh. I remarked how dirty the sheets were and he said he “fell at the gym and cut his knee and it got all over his sheets.” We were not exclusive at this time.  \n\nI was mad and knew he was lying! It was obvious the blood was from period sex. Either way it would have been an awkward conversation, but I find he lies often to cover his tracks like this. Is this a huge red flag? It worries me that if he is lying about these obvious things, what else could he lie about? \n\nI really like him and I’m an aging female who is feeling a bit desperate to get into a relationship. I’m worried I’m falling for him (he told me he loved me - def seemed a bit shallow though!) and I’m overlooking red flags. I worry that the lying could be a sign of a deeper personality disorder like psychopathy or something like that. I had a hunch that he stole a watch from me I was super excited about (not for the money! He’s rich) but just to hurt me. But I have no way to prove it and I’m not sure if I’m just being delusional and paranoid. \n\nWe currently are dating long distance. I went to visit him and he was showing signs of being very ill. He was coughing, having trouble swallowing because it seemed like he had a sore throat, and lost his voice. He seemed very sick. But kept kissing me. I asked him if he was feeling sick and he said he “was talking too much at meetings at work and felt completely fine but had simply lost his voice.” I never got fully sick but I returned home to my family and my sister got whatever he had. She could barely swallow and now my mom has it too! \n\nEverything else about him checks out. He works as a software engineer at an extremely prestigious tech company. He comes from a stable family, his mom went to Harvard and graduated at the top of her class. He wants to be in a serious relationship with me and flatters me. He is exactly my type and we share a lot in common. We both love spending time with each other and share intellectual conversations. He checks so many boxes for me on a physical level and I am so excited at the prospect of sharing more of my life with him and finally being in a serious relationship, but I just really worry he is a serious time waster!! \n\nHe is very secretive in general. For example, he’s in the process of buying an apartment, but he won’t tell me anything about it. He is writing a book but won’t tell me anything about the plot. He keeps a lot of things to himself and seems kinda shady. He developed his own app and our mutual friend was really annoyed that this guy wouldn’t tell him anything about the app while he was working on it. There’s definitely something shady about him. \n\nTLDR: guy I’m dating seems to lie often. Is this a huge red flag?",
    "human": "Ew. Sorry but - you went to climb into bed with this guy and there was another woman’s period blood on the sheets… and the relationship didn’t end then and there?!?!\n\nI am a woman. I get period blood and how messy it can be. We’ve all had spillage and stuff - so no judgement there. But - he couldn’t even wash the sheets between women?!? Or yanno… head over to his local whatever-mart and pick up $20 sheets before you came over?!?\n\nAnd why are you talking about how “he kept kissing” you?!? If he was sick, why were YOU kissing him?!?\n\nI’m not trying to be mean but…I understand wanting to be in a relationship - but if you are going to close your eyes to all this behavior (not even to mention the lying!) - and not respect yourself - then you aren’t going to find a GOOD relationship.\n\nI think you should ditch this guy and re-evaluate why you feel being in a BAD relationship is better than being single.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking a step back to re-evaluate your feelings and concerns about this relationship. It's understandable that you're torn between your attraction to him and the red flags you've noticed.\n\nLying about obvious things, like the period blood on the sheets, is a significant red flag. It's not just a one-time mistake; it's a pattern of behavior that suggests he's not trustworthy. This type of dishonesty can be a sign of a deeper issue, such as a lack of empathy, a need for control, or even a personality disorder, as you mentioned.\n\nThe fact that he lied about being sick and potentially exposed you and your family to an illness is also concerning. It's not just about the lying; it's about his willingness to put others at risk to avoid being honest.\n\nThe other red flags you've mentioned, such as his secrecy and unwillingness to share information about his life, are also concerning. His secrecy about his apartment, book, and app development are all signs that he may be hiding something or not be willing to be open and transparent.\n\nIt's essential to consider whether these red flags are a deal-breaker for you. While he may check many boxes for you on a physical and intellectual level, his lack of honesty and transparency may be a significant issue for your long-term well-being.\n\nI would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you're willing to accept in a relationship and whether his behavior is something you're comfortable with. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and see how he responds. However, be prepared for the possibility that he may not be willing to change his behavior or be honest with you.\n\nRemember, your well-being and trust are essential in any relationship. It's better to prioritize these qualities than to overlook red flags and potentially end up in a toxic or unhealthy situation."

They've been very close all these years and in a month or so he will be the only child, so to speak, in the household. Suddenly going to having no siblings is gonna be tough for him, and though there's phone calls and such, it won't be the same.\n\nTL;DR My daughter is moving away soon and I'm worried my son will take it hard.

Why didn’t they establish friendships in the neighborhood? Why didn’t you enroll them in sports or other activities? Why have you isolated them from others?\n\nI have friends and family who homeschool (variety of reasons), and none of them have said that their kids don’t have friends other than siblings. They have all connected with other homeschooling families, put their kids in sports or activities, taken them to the community pool, encouraged neighborhood friendships, etc. \n\nWhy didn’t you?",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's natural to worry about your son's adjustment to being the only child in the household. It's a big change, and it's great that you're thinking ahead.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel worried. It's normal to be concerned about your child's well-being, especially when it comes to significant changes like this.\n\nTo support your son through this transition, I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Let him know that you understand it's a big change, and that it's okay to feel whatever emotions he's feeling. Validate his feelings, but also reassure him that you're there for him and will support him through this.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask him how he's feeling about his sister leaving, and what he thinks it will be like for him to be the only child at home. Listen actively to his response and try to understand his perspective. This will help him feel heard and understood.\n\nAdditionally, you could also suggest doing some activities together that you both enjoy, like playing a game, watching a movie, or going for a walk. This can help create a sense of normalcy and provide a sense of comfort during this transition.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay if he doesn't immediately open up about his feelings. Some people take time to process their emotions, and that's okay. Just being present and available for him when he's ready to talk can go a long way.\n\nLastly, consider having a plan in place for regular check-ins with his sister, whether it's weekly phone calls or video calls. This can help him feel more connected to her and maintain a sense of closeness despite the physical distance.\n\nRemember, every child is different, and it's hard to predict exactly how your son will react to this change. But by being open, empathetic, and supportive, you can help him navigate this transition and come out stronger on the other side."

It's tough to navigate unrequited love, especially when it's with someone as close as a best friend.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel the way you do. It's natural to experience pain and longing when you have strong feelings for someone, even if they're not reciprocated.\n\nTo maintain your friendship without constantly feeling upset and jealous, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish what you're comfortable with in terms of your interactions with her and her boyfriend. For instance, you might need some space when they post about their relationship or when they're together in public. Communicate your boundaries clearly with your friend, and respect hers as well.\n2. **Focus on shared interests**: While it's natural to feel drawn to your friend, try to focus on the aspects of your friendship that are not romantically related. Engage in activities, hobbies, or conversations that bring you both joy and closeness, but avoid romantic or intimate topics.\n3. **Create distance**: If seeing her with her boyfriend or posts about him is too painful, take a step back and give yourself some space. This doesn't mean cutting her off entirely, but rather creating some emotional distance to process your feelings. You can still maintain regular communication through messages or phone calls.\n4. **Prioritize self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your own needs. This will help you feel more grounded and less reactive to feelings of jealousy or sadness.\n5. **Seek support**: Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your feelings. Sharing your emotions with someone who can offer a neutral perspective can help you gain clarity and develop coping strategies.\n6. **Accept the reality**: Recognize that your friend's feelings for you are not going to change, and it's not about you not being worthy or lovable. Accept that this is a normal part of life, and it's okay to have unrequited love.\n7. **Respect her boundaries**: Remember that your friend has told you she needs you in her life, but not in a romantic way. Respect her boundaries and don't pressure her or try to change her feelings. This can damage the friendship and create unnecessary tension.\n\nRemember, it's possible to maintain a close friendship with someone you have strong feelings for, but it requires effort, self-awareness, and a willingness to prioritize your own well-being."

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're acknowledging this pattern in yourself! Recognizing it's the first step to making a change.\n\nFirstly, let's break it down: being overreactive is often a coping mechanism, a way to release pent-up emotions or energy. So, we need to address the underlying reasons behind your overreactiveness. Ask yourself:\n\n* What are you trying to achieve with your reactions? Are you seeking attention, trying to diffuse tension, or simply expressing yourself?\n* Are there any unresolved issues or stressors in your life that might be contributing to your overreactiveness?\n\nNow, to work on becoming less overreactive:\n\n1. **Pause before reacting**: When you feel yourself getting worked up, take a deep breath and pause for 10-15 seconds before responding. This simple pause can help you reframe your reaction and respond more thoughtfully.\n2. **Label your emotions**: Acknowledge your emotions and label them. Say to yourself, \"I'm feeling frustrated\" or \"I'm feeling excited.\" This helps you become more aware of your emotions and can help you respond more constructively.\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness practices, such as meditation or yoga, can help you develop greater self-awareness, which can reduce impulsive reactions.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Learn to prioritize your own emotional well-being by setting boundaries with others. If someone is consistently pushing your buttons, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n5. **Develop more constructive outlets**: Find healthy ways to express yourself, such as writing, drawing, or engaging in a hobby. This can help channel your emotions in a more positive direction.\n6. **Practice self-reflection**: Regularly take time to reflect on your reactions and their impact on others. Ask yourself if your reactions are constructive or destructive, and work on making adjustments.\n\nRegarding your tendency to speak too much, try to:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Focus on listening more and speaking less. This will help you better understand others and respond more thoughtfully.\n2. **Set a \"talking limit\"**: Set a goal for yourself to limit your speaking time in conversations. This can help you become more mindful of your communication style.\n3. **Practice assertive communication**: Learn to express yourself clearly and assertively without dominating conversations.\n\nRemember, changing habits takes time and effort.

Is it a minor comment from someone who doesn't matter in your life? Is it a genuine concern or a personal attack? Recognizing the difference can help you prioritize your emotions.\n2. **Develop a growth mindset**: Instead of taking things personally, try to see them as opportunities for growth and learning. Ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this situation?\" or \"How can I use this as a chance to improve myself?\"\n3. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" or \"I'm not interested\" when someone's behavior or comments are toxic or draining.

My SO was horrified with what had happened and told me everything straight away. I proceeded to break up with him but due to the enormous support which he gave me following everything we managed to patch things up and we've been going strong ever since. \nMy SO told me and everyone around the truth, baring reactions with intense self loathing but dignity, caring far more about my feelings than what anyone thought of him. My friend on the other hand focussed primarily on her image within the friendship group and proceeded to lie and twist the truth about what has happened, making me out to be overreacting and my SO out to be a social manipulator.

You can search for opportunities on websites like VolunteerMatch or Idealist.\n3. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, language course, or art class. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also meet people with similar interests.\n4. **Attend events and gatherings**: Look for events in your community, such as concerts, festivals, or networking events. You can also try attending meetups or gatherings through websites like Meetup.com.\n5. **Be patient and consistent**: Building friendships takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep putting yourself out there and attending events, and eventually, you'll find people with similar interests and values.\n6. **Practice active listening**: When you do meet new people, make an effort to actively listen to them. Ask follow-up questions, show genuine interest, and avoid dominating the conversation.\n7. **Don't be too hard on yourself**: It's okay if you don't click with everyone you meet. Don't be too disappointed if conversations don't lead to lasting connections. Keep putting yourself out there and focus on building relationships that feel meaningful to you.\n\nTo overcome the awkward silence, try:\n\n1. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes or no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves.\n2. **Find common ground**: Look for something you both have in common, whether it's a shared interest, a favorite TV show, or a similar experience. This can help you build a connection and keep the conversation flowing.\n3. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in building relationships. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People are more likely to be drawn to someone who is genuine and comfortable in their own skin.\n\nRemember, making new friends takes time and effort. Be patient, stay positive, and keep putting yourself out there. Good luck!"

I say debate, even just discussions about the deepers topics in life. \n\nI enjoy the discussions but usually avoid them because I find it can be a bit awkard or cause friction. Maybe it's me and the way I go about things.   \n\n\nAny advice to keep having the chats, just keep it light and fun without reducing them too much into complete silliness?",
    "human": "My experience is that debates usually derail because of emotions. So whenever someone feels emotionally threatened (often unconsciously), they get angry. If feasible, try to take that person seriously and maybe try to find and address their issue.\n\nYeah I know this sounds very arduous and seems like leaving the actual discussion, but unfortunately we rarely ACTUALLY talk about facts in such debates.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Debates and discussions about deeper topics can be intimidating, especially when you want to keep the atmosphere light and fun. Here are some tips to help you navigate these conversations with ease:\n\n1. **Set the tone**: Before diving into a topic, establish a friendly and respectful tone. You can do this by acknowledging that everyone has different opinions and experiences, and that the goal is to understand each other's perspectives, not to \"win\" the argument.\n\n2. **Choose the right medium**: Consider the platform or setting where you'll be discussing the topic. Online discussions can be more anonymous and heated, while in-person conversations can be more intimate and nuanced. Choose a medium that allows for more thoughtful consideration and less miscommunication.\n\n3. **Prepare ahead of time**: Take some time to think about the topic, gather your thoughts, and consider the potential counterarguments. This will help you stay calm and composed during the discussion, and you'll be better equipped to respond thoughtfully.\n\n4. **Active listening**: When someone is speaking, give them your undivided attention. Avoid interrupting, and try to paraphrase what they're saying to ensure you understand their perspective. This will also help you respond more effectively and avoid miscommunication.\n\n5. **Avoid taking it personally**: Remember that opinions are subjective and not a reflection of your worth as a person. Try to separate the topic from your personal identity and focus on the issue at hand.\n\n6. **Keep it concise**: Don't feel like you need to tackle every aspect of the topic. Focus on one or two key points, and try to summarize your thoughts in a clear and concise manner.\n\n7. **Laugh and acknowledge the absurdity**: Sometimes, discussions can get intense or emotional. Don't be afraid to acknowledge the absurdity of the situation and take a step back to laugh or joke about it. This can help diffuse tension and keep the conversation light.\n\n8. **Agree to disagree**: You don't always need to find common ground or resolve the issue. Sometimes, it's okay to agree to disagree and move on. Remember that it's okay to have different opinions, and that doesn't mean you're wrong or the other person is right.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a space for respectful, engaging, and enjoyable discussions that don't sacrifice depth for levity. Happy debating!"

    "base_reply": "The age-old dilemma!\n\nWhen someone asks you how much you spent on something, it's understandable that you might not want to share the exact amount. You can use a few strategies to respond without being rude or revealing too much information:\n\n1. **Dodge the question**: You can simply say, \"Oh, it was within my budget\" or \"I'm happy with the purchase, but I'd rather not share the exact cost.\" This response acknowledges their curiosity without obliging them to know the exact amount.\n2. **Focus on the value**: Instead of talking about the price, focus on the value you got from the purchase. For example, \"I got a great deal on it, and it's really improved my [insert benefit here, e.g., 'life' or 'work'].\"\n3. **Use a vague range**: If you feel comfortable sharing a rough estimate, you can give a vague range, like \"It was in the [insert range, e.g., 'hundreds' or 'low thousands']\" without providing the exact amount.\n4. **Change the subject**: If you're not comfortable discussing the cost, try to steer the conversation towards something else. You can say, \"Speaking of [related topic], have you heard about [insert new topic]?\"\n5. **Be honest, but tactfully**: If you're close to the person asking, you can be honest while still being tactful. For example, \"I'd rather not share the exact amount, but I can tell you it was a significant investment. Let's just say it's something I'm happy to have in my life.\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and boundaries in these situations. You don't owe anyone an explanation for your financial decisions, and it's not necessary to share more than you're comfortable with."

It's like your sense of purpose and direction has been taken away, and it can be really tough to find your footing again.\n\nFirst of all, let's acknowledge that it's okay to not know what you want to do or what you enjoy right now. It's okay to take your time and figure things out. The pressure to have it all figured out right away can be overwhelming, and it's normal to feel like you're just drifting through life.\n\nOne thing that might help is to take small steps towards doing things that bring you joy, even if it's just for a little while each day. It could be watching YouTube, reading a book, taking a walk, or even just doing a puzzle. The key is to make time for activities that bring you some sense of pleasure or calm, even if it's not related to your future plans.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to explore your interests and values. What are some things that you used to enjoy doing in high school? What are some things that you're passionate about? What kind of values do you want to live by? Reflecting on these things can help you get a sense of what might be important to you, even if you're not sure what your career path is yet.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people go through periods of uncertainty and self-doubt, and it's okay to ask for help. Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or even a therapist about how you're feeling. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone who cares about you can help you feel more grounded and less alone.\n\nLastly, try not to put too much pressure on yourself to have it all figured out right away. Give yourself permission to take your time, and remember that it's okay to change your mind or try new things. You don't have to have it all figured out right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\nRemember, you're not lost forever, and you will find your way. It might take some time, but you will get through this."

    "sentence": "I (24f) have been with my boyfriend (24m) for just over three months. Everything was going really well in the beginning until recently when I started realizing a couple red flags. First, about a month ago, we went camping with a group of my friends. During this trip, he accidentally put my phone into a melted water cooler, and didn’t notice until 20 minutes later. My phone was 100% broken, and while I was annoyed, I didn’t yell at him. I did end up telling him that while I was upset, I understand accidents happen, I just wish he had been more careful with my belongings. He ended up crying in our tent, and refusing to go out and join my friends on the boat. Feeling bad that he was upset, I offered to stay with him and he asked me to stay. This sort of annoyed me because he’s the one who upset me and now I was comforting him and it was ruining my trip. He also told me he would get me a new phone case and so when I sent him the link to the one I wanted, he never bought it and waited till it sold out. \n\n        A couple weeks later, I invited him to come to a small, local music festival with my friends in my hometown. The day of, I had treated him to a nice breakfast as it was my mother’s birthday and given him some cash ($100) because he has been unemployed after a car accident and didn’t have spending money. I then paid for our tickets and we went to get some alcohol to bring to the festival. At the store, he put his beer on the counter with my stuff, despite me never offering to pay. When I asked if he expected me to pay for his stuff too, he said “Sure.” Now, this already rubbed me the wrong way because it seemed a bit unappreciative of all the things I had done for him prior, but I let it slide. \n\n     Once we arrived at the festival, he was upset that I bought my best friend a drink at the bar and not him. He also hardly spoke and was in a bad mood all day. He also nearly forgot my bag that he insisted on carrying in the middle of a field. The next day, he didn’t even want to go to the last day of the festival and this sort of upset me because I paid a lot of money for our tickets. \n\n     When I finally spoke up about how his behaviour that weekend made me feel really unappreciated, he ended up admitting that he was so nervous about running into someone I had dated that he couldn’t enjoy his time, which seemed sort of unfair to me because I can’t do anything about the fact I’ve dated people before him and that we might run into them. He also then turned the argument into how I don’t even like him and I just want him to change. This man has never planned a date or boughten a gift, and yet makes me get him Prada for his birthday. I feel so unappreciated and like I have to walk on eggshells. What do I do? I really like him but it just feels like he is more immature than me at the moment.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend throws a fit and gets upset anytime I say he has hurt me or upset my feelings, also spends all my money without a second thought",

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated, annoyed, and unappreciated in your relationship.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you have every right to feel the way you do. Your feelings are valid, and it's not okay for your boyfriend to make you feel like you're walking on eggshells or that you need to constantly apologize for your emotions.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that his behavior is not okay. His lack of consideration for your belongings, his expectation that you should pay for his expenses, and his inability to take responsibility for his actions are all red flags.\n\nI want to encourage you to take a step back and assess whether this relationship is healthy and sustainable for you. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you consistently feeling valued and respected in this relationship?\n2. Are you comfortable with the way your boyfriend handles conflicts and emotions?\n3. Are you feeling like you're carrying the emotional labor in the relationship?\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how his behavior is affecting you. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example:\n\n\"I feel frustrated when you don't take care of my belongings. It makes me feel like you're not respecting me or my property.\"\n\n\"I feel unappreciated when you expect me to pay for your expenses without even asking. It makes me feel like I'm being taken advantage of.\"\n\n\"I feel hurt when you get upset and defensive instead of listening to my concerns. It makes me feel like I'm not being heard or validated.\"\n\nRemember that you deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, and consideration in a relationship. If your boyfriend is unable or unwilling to make changes to address your concerns, it might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is right for you.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel seen, heard, and valued."

Helping someone reframe their negative self-talk and build confidence can be a delicate process, but here are some little things you can do to encourage them:\n\n1. **Reflect their strengths**: When they're talking, actively listen and highlight their positive qualities, skills, or accomplishments. Make it specific and genuine, like, \"Hey, I've noticed you're really good at [specific skill].\"\n2. **Challenge negative self-talk**: When they make a negative statement about themselves, gently challenge it with a question like, \"Really? What makes you think that?\" or \"Is that really true?\" This can help them recognize their own biases.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Encourage your friend to treat themselves with kindness and understanding, just as they would a close friend. Remind them that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect.\n4. **Focus on effort, not outcome**: When they're beating themselves up over a mistake, redirect the focus to the effort they put in, rather than the outcome. For example, \"You worked really hard on that project, and that's something to be proud of, regardless of the result.\"\n5. **Help them reframe perceived slights**: When they assume someone's gratitude is sarcastic, ask them to consider alternative explanations. For instance, \"Maybe they were just distracted or having a bad day. It's not necessarily about you.\"\n6. **Encourage self-reflection**: Ask open-ended questions that prompt them to think about their thoughts and feelings, such as \"How did you feel about that situation?\" or \"What do you think might have happened in that situation?\"\n7. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate their small achievements, even if they seem insignificant. This can help build confidence and a sense of accomplishment.\n8. **Model self-compassion yourself**: Show your friend that it's okay to make mistakes and that you, too, can be kind to yourself when things don't go as planned.\n\nRemember to be patient and understanding, as changing thought patterns takes time.

You can also check websites like Craigslist, Facebook Groups, or local online classifieds for affordable rooms or apartments.\n4. **Build an emergency fund**: Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will help you cover unexpected expenses and avoid debt.\n5. **Seek support**: Reach out to local non-profits, community organizations, or government agencies that provide assistance for young adults in similar situations.

Having a plan will help you stay motivated and focused.\n\nRemember, this is a challenging situation, but it's not insurmountable.

This can help calm your body and brain. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body.\n2. **Distract yourself**: Engage your mind in a different activity or thought process. Think about a non-erotic topic, like a hobby, a book you're reading, or a conversation you had with a friend. This can help shift your focus away from the physical sensations.\n3. **Communicate with your partner**: Have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're excited, but also a bit overwhelmed by your physical response. She might be able to offer support, reassurance, or even some humor to help you relax.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Establish some physical boundaries with yourself. For example, you could decide that you'll wait a bit before touching or holding hands, or that you'll take a break from physical contact for a little while. This can help you regain control and composure.\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to feel excited and aroused. It's a natural response to a romantic connection. Don't beat yourself up over it or try to suppress your feelings. Instead, acknowledge them and focus on finding ways to manage them.\n6. **Take things slow**: Don't rush into physical intimacy. Take your time, and focus on building a connection with her through conversation, shared activities, and getting to know each other's interests and values.\n7. **Consider a \"cool-down\" routine**: Develop a pre-date or pre-encounter routine that helps you calm down and regulate your physical response. This could be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or doing some light stretching.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel a strong physical response when you're excited about someone. The key is to find ways to manage it and maintain a sense of control and composure. With practice and patience, you'll develop strategies that work for you and help you navigate these feelings in a way that feels comfortable and respectful for both you and your partner."

    "human": "Here's what I do to quit losing things. Not entirely foolproof, but it helps.\n\nHave a place for everything and keep the important things together. When I leave the house, my keys go in my left pocket, cell phone goes in the right pocket, wallet goes in the little top pocket in my backpack. When I get home, the wallet and keys go on my shelf by the door, and my cell goes on the table by my recliner. When I go to bed, the cell phone goes into the charger on the shelf by the bed. \n\nI used to lose things like my wallet or keys once a week at least. Now it's months in between.",
    "base_reply": "Losing things can be frustrating, to say the least! Don't worry, it's a common phenomenon, and I'm here to help.\n\nFirstly, take a deep breath and don't beat yourself up over it. It's easy to get caught up in the stress of losing something important, but let's focus on finding a solution.\n\nSince you can't recall where you last had your phone, let's work backwards. Think about the last few places you were before you realized it was missing. Did you visit any specific locations, talk to anyone, or do any activities? Try to recall the context in which you last had your phone.\n\nHere are a few strategies to help you find your phone or prevent future losses:\n\n1. **Create a routine**: Establish a consistent place to keep your phone, like a designated spot in your bag, wallet, or a specific area at home. This can help you develop a habit of putting your phone in the same spot every time.\n2. **Use a tracking app**: Consider using a tracking app like Find My iPhone (if you have an Apple device) or Google's Find My Device (for Android). These apps can help you locate your phone on a map, lock it remotely, or erase its data if it's lost or stolen.\n3. **Make it harder to misplace**: Consider using a phone case or wallet with a built-in phone holder. This can help keep your phone secure and prevent it from slipping out of your hands or getting misplaced.\n4. **Create a 'lost and found' system**: Designate a spot in your home or workspace where you'll keep a small notebook or a sticky note with a list of items you've misplaced. This can help you keep track of what you've lost and where you last had it.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: When you're in a rush or distracted, it's easy to misplace things. Try to stay present and focused on your surroundings, and make a conscious effort to put your phone in its designated spot.\n\nRemember, losing things is a common experience, and it's not a reflection of your character or abilities. By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the likelihood of losing your phone and other items in the future.\n\nTake your time, and I hope you'll be reunited with your phone soon!"

He was the first person I dated. I absolutely adored him. He was the love of my life, my best friend, my life partner. It's sad to say, but I thought he would be the last person on earth to cheat. But here we are.  \n\nI've had so much issues with my mental health since finding out about the affair. I feel so naive. I trusted this man 100 percent. He always portrayed himself as someone with a high moral compass. I remember him expressing how much disdain he has for people who cheat. I did sense something off about him and this girl. I confronted him about it and he managed to look me in the eye and deny everything. He looked me in the fucking eye and told me he loved me and only me. That he would never cheat on me. Only for me to catch him a week after. And then subsequently, leaving me for his affair partner.

It's a brutal and painful experience, and it's natural to feel like your trust has been shattered and your sense of self-worth has been rocked.\n\nRecovering from infidelity is a long and challenging process, but it's possible. Here's what I want you to know: you're not alone, and it's okay to take your time. It's okay to not be okay.\n\nFor those who have gone through similar situations, I've seen that recovery often involves a combination of self-reflection, self-care, and professional help. Here are some steps that might help:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to grieve**: It's essential to acknowledge the loss of your relationship, the loss of your trust, and the loss of the person you thought you knew. Give yourself permission to feel the emotions that come with this grief.\n2. **Seek professional help**: Consider couples therapy or individual therapy to process your emotions and work through the trauma. A therapist can help you develop coping strategies and provide a safe space to explore your feelings.\n3. **Focus on self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize rest and relaxation.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries for yourself to protect your emotional well-being. This might mean avoiding social media or limiting interactions with your ex or his new partner.\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over what happened. Remember that you didn't deserve to be cheated on, and it's not a reflection of your worth.\n6. **Take time to heal**: Recovery is a journey, and it's essential to give yourself time to heal. Don't rush into new relationships or try to \"get over\" the infidelity too quickly.\n7. **Consider a support group**: Joining a support group or online community for people who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful. Sharing your story and connecting with others who understand can be a powerful way to heal.\n\nRemember, recovery is unique to each person, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Be patient, kind, and gentle with yourself as you navigate this difficult time.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to not trust again. It's okay to take time to rebuild your sense of trust and to figure out what healthy relationships look like for you. You deserve to be treated with respect, honesty, and love."

    "sentence": "How can i learn to cope with feeling this way? What are some things that i should consider?\n\nFor context, my bf (m18) and i (f18)  have been dating for about 2 months after talking for 6 months. We both have had no previous sexual experience and no past relationships. Although i know we're young and it may seem silly to some of you, i'd like to be optimistic in thinking we'll be together long term. I knew he watched porn and i did suspect an addiction but it wasn't an issue before we got sexually intimate and he seemed to be in denial about it for a while until recently.\n\nWhen i lost my virginity to him, he asked me if i could \"tighten myself\" it upset me a lot and after bringing it up to him, he explained that it was less tighter than he expected and that he wanted to know if females could tense up down there. We soon after recognised that it might've been due to the \"death grip\" due to his habits of masturbating and watching porn everyday. As a former porn addict of almost 10 years, i know how hard it is, but i set my boundaries and expressed that i wasn't comfortable with my parter watching porn so we both collectively stopped watching it. Soon after, whenever we had sex, he was unable to get it hard for longer than 2 minutes. When this happened for the first time, we were both sexually frustrated and i couldn't help but feel offended. He was so sexually frustrated to the point where we he asked me if he could \"watch something (porn)\" while i was right next to him! Despite knowing how much it made me upset. He ended up going to the bathroom and being completely oblivious, i thought that he was genuinely taking a piss. I laid there naked, undesirable, ugly, not enough like an idiot waiting for him to come back until i ended up walking pass the bathroom only to hear moaning sounds. He told me that he'd work on himself. But obviously when these kinds of things happen, you can't help but keep these degrading thoughts it in the back of your mind. I know it's likely nothing to do with me but you can't help but feel what you feel.\n\nI was vulnerable and cried to him about my insecurities and low self esteem after seeing him like half naked pictures of local ig models. I told him that i'd give him sex whenever he wants, if it means that he won't watch porn for his and our sake. I know it sounds pathetic...but i'd do anything for him to stop lusting and looking at other females. We now rely on viagra after seeing a doctor and everything was fine for a few weeks, no porn. Until recently, he started to relapse again. I know it isn't his fault but it's so much emotional baggage for me. I asked him if he thought of me and how i felt before doing so and he said yes but proceeded to do it anyway because he gave into his urges and thought that he'd feel less guilty because i'm an understanding person.\n\nOur sex life has been and gone to shit. I don't feel any sexual intimacy, emotional connections or love. It's simply the physical act of sex. I told him about it and he was confused but ended up doing research on 'how to be intimate?' in which he thought was awkward but agreed to work on it. This included things such as hand holding, kissing, making out, foreplay, being verbal and caressing - all of which he does little to never. I have a high sex drive and it's my way of feeling love. He doesn't initiate sex as often as he used to and it makes me sexually frustrated. I have all the reason to suspect that it's due to porn and masturbation. The type of unrealistic content and animalistic betrayal of women showcased in porn has ruined the idea of sex - which is something that is meant to be meaningful, full of emotion and energy exchange, and somewhat 'sacred'. It is my way of feeling intimate and fully feeling love with him as a whole and i feel like this is a huge barrier between us. I can never live up to the standards of those models on instagram or in porn. I just feel so insecure and so so sad because i never feel like i'm the only one in his eyes. No matter how much i cry, vent, and beg him to treat me right, it has to take him rock bottom to see the damage it has done to our relationship. It's so hard because i love him so much and i only feel this way because i care.\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend has done many things and made mistakes due to his porn addiction in which has made me feel undesirable, unwanted and upset. The sex has gone to shit because i don't feel any intimacy or emotional connections and it's ruining our relationship. I can't help but feel this way and i don't know how to cope",

    "sentence": "TLDR: My girlfriend went through my phone. I feel like I should be the mad one. Maybe we’re both in the wrong?\n\nHi, my girlfriend has been accusing me of being unhappy for a bit. I keep telling her that I am happy, but I can’t convince her.\n\nEither way, while I took a shower she went through my phone.\n\nWhat she found was a Facebook search of my ex and a meme from an Adult Child of Alcoholics sponsor who happens to be female and engaged about King of the Hill.\n\nAs a result, my gf is accusing me of being a cheater and everything. Things like still being in love with my ex. It’s so hard to explain that I have been faithful. It’s weird to explain the psychology of Facebook searching old partners, friends, or even bullies, but it’s something Ive done occasionally.\n\nI don’t know how to unpack everything. I don’t know if I’m really in the wrong. In my eyes, I haven’t really done anything.\n\nBut I guess that’s why I need outsider perspective. Am I a bad person and I don’t know it?",
    "human": "She’s totally making a mountain out of a molehill. 🚩",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a tough situation. It sounds like your girlfriend has found something that's made her feel uneasy and insecure, and now she's lashing out. I'm not here to tell you that you're a bad person, but I do want to help you understand what's going on.\n\nFirstly, it's completely normal to have old flames or acquaintances on your social media, and it's not necessarily a red flag. However, I do think you need to understand why your girlfriend felt the need to snoop through your phone in the first place. Has there been a pattern of mistrust or insecurity in your relationship? Have you been open with her about your past or your feelings?\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend's reaction is a big part of this situation. She's accusing you of being a cheater, and that's a serious accusation. You can't just brush it off and say you're not a cheater, because for her, the act of searching for your ex on Facebook is perceived as a betrayal.\n\nYou need to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about what's going on. Explain to her that you understand why she felt hurt, but also make it clear that you haven't done anything wrong. You can say something like, \"I understand why you felt hurt when you saw that, but I want you to know that I'm committed to our relationship and I haven't done anything to jeopardize it. I think we need to work on building trust and communication in our relationship.\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend's actions were not okay. Going through your phone without your permission is a violation of your privacy, and you need to address that. You can say something like, \"I want to talk to you about what happened when you went through my phone. I feel disrespected and hurt that you didn't trust me enough to ask me about it. I need you to respect my boundaries and my privacy in our relationship.\"\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and communication. You need to work together to build trust and understanding. It's not about being the \"mad one\" or the \"wrong one.\" It's about being honest and open with each other and working through the tough stuff together."

    "sentence": "So I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years, lived together renting for the past 1 year. We're at the point where she's looking to move forwards in terms of the relationship, buy a house, settle down and look to marry/have children in the next couple years. I've got massive resistance towards this. I've been trying to be open/honest and communicate this with her, and she's been understanding, but it's now at the point where she's saying that she needs me to be able to commit and buy a house otherwise I need to let her go (fair enough on her part).\n\nBecause I've not been wanting to break up at the minute, i've been going along with the house viewings she's arranged. Even put an offer on a few for the practice. Throughout the past few weeks I've repeatedly voiced this resistance I've had that feels like I'm not sure if I want to do this and maybe I'm not ready yet, but the multi-hour long conversations more or less end in the same situation - that she wants to move forwards, sees it as the logical next step, and if I'm not comfortable then that's the decision to not move forwards.\n\nSo basically one house viewing three weeks ago, she sees it and wants to put down an offer, I'm hesistant but agree. We end up getting the house. My initial gut reaction is fuck, I don't want this, panic. She calms me down and says look it's not permanent yet it takes 3 months and we can pull out any time if you have to. Over the next 2 weeks we have some difficult decisions. One such encounter was me saying I'm not sure about it, and her saying okay you can call up and cancel it then. For the rest of the evening it really felt like we were about to break up. It was really sad - we were both crying and there was a lot of pain. We talked for a few hours - and hugged/reconciled. Whilst initially I was feeling like maybe it was for the best, at the end I was struggling to see how I could live without her and throw away all the good things we have.\n\nThe last two weeks have been exhausting to say the least. My brain has been constantly flip flopping between 'I can't go through with this' to 'I can't lose her and throw away a good thing'. I know it's not healthy and it's really not fair on her, but I just feel so stuck in making the decision to commit or walk away basically. What the doubts/feelings of not wanting to do this are a gut feeling of settling maybe, or thinking is there someone more compatible for me out there, or some aspects of her personality like thinking she could be more confident or have more interests in line with me. It's been a predominant feeling throughout the relationship. When I think about the relationship over the past 3 years, it's had its ups and downs. I tried to break up with her at 1.5 years for the same reason, but after &gt;24h I was thinking it was the wrong decision and was in a lot of pain regretting and we got back together, I was thinking that maybe I didn't give it a fair enough go or work on the relationship enough, or maybe the feelings I've had were just part of me/my mood and I'd feel the same at this point in any long term relationship. 1.5 years later I seem to be in a similar predicament. She's often been the one that's reassured me that she's chosen to stay with me and accepted the risk (of her being older and being conscious of biological clock etc) because she sees a future with us.\n\nWhat's difficult is there are some really good parts to the relationship. She consistently tells me that it's the best relationship she's had, we talk well, care for each other, look after each other. We try and be silly, she loves me deeply, and we've had some good moments.\n\nI guess in terms of my emotions since this predicament and the flip flopping, there's an underlying sense of panic and indecision that I'll make the wrong decision no matter what, with so many doubts circulating. Idk if this is just a sign I'm messed up from attachment issues (fearful avoidant), or if it's gut feelings I should listen to. If i'm messed up maybe I don't know how good I've got it and maybe I should just buy the house. The feeling I have of feeling unsatisfied/unfulfilled with her I just don't know if it's a sign that I need to work on myself more instead or something like that, if I'd feel it with anyone. I don't know if this fear to buying the house is because it's a fear of commitment that needs to be pushed through. I know there's no right answer really, which also tears me apart inside. And I don't want to stay with her out of fear of being alone/not finding anyone like her again, which I think may be playing a part in this.\n\nAs you can tell there's a lot of overthinking, self-doubt, and fear here. Is the fact I'm even questioning it this much a sign? When I think about losing her it's absolutely heartbreaking to not see her after work everyday, play with our cat and go on little adventures. I still love her and want to make her happy. And I can kind of think myself into seeing us having a good time in our new house and feel excited (which confuses me more). But then idk if that's all just fantasy/future thinking and not looking at now, and evidence from the past 3 years, which is not feeling that fulfilled when I'm with her on dates and things. I seem to be a different person almost with other people than her - like I don't seem to put as much conversation etc or have as much energy with her.\n\nTLDR: I (27M) have been flipflopping about buying a house with my girlfriend (30F) or breaking up with her if I feel this much resistance towards buying the house. Put an offer in for house, actually got it, now on a time pressure to decide. Don't know what to do, time has pretty much run out. Feel torn between leaving or pushing through the fear and going for it.\n\nEdit/update: Thanks everyone for your replies. I had a chat with her not long after making the post as there were documents to sign. I told her that I couldn't go through with it, it was too much for me. It now feels like we're breaking up and it's extremely painful. Whilst part of me is thinking this is probably for the best, the other part is screaming that I don't want this or to lose her. On reflection, I'm remembering that the underlying feeling of doubt/settling I have with her due to a lack of connection at times (there have been times where I feel very connected to her) - and wondering is this something that could be worked on or part of my dismissive attachment style to work on. To clarify I've also been getting therapy for 4 months now, which has helped a little bit but still feel conflicted.",
    "human": "Do you want a future with her that includes all the things she wants?\n\nIf the answer is anything other than yes, it's a no and you need to let her go. Ambivalence, especially after this long, means no.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's clear you're torn and struggling with conflicting emotions. I'll do my best to help you untangle your thoughts and feelings.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging your attachment style and seeking therapy is a great step. It's not uncommon for people with dismissive attachment styles to struggle with commitment and intimacy. It's possible that your feelings of doubt and uncertainty are related to this.\n\nNow, let's break down your concerns:\n\n1. Fear of settling: It's natural to wonder if you're settling for someone who isn't the best match for you. However, it's also important to recognize that relationships are complex, and people grow and change together. If you're unsure, it might be worth exploring what specifically is making you feel like you're settling. Is it the lack of connection, or is it something else?\n2. Doubts about compatibility: It's normal to wonder if there's someone more compatible out there. However, it's important to remember that you've had 3 years with this person, and there are many aspects of your relationship that are working well. You've also mentioned that she loves you deeply and sees a future with you.\n3. Fear of loss: It's natural to feel scared of losing someone you care about. However, it's important to recognize that this fear is not a reason to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for you.\n4. Fear of being alone: It's natural to fear being alone, but it's important to recognize that you can't stay in a relationship that's not right for you just to avoid being alone. You deserve to be in a relationship that brings you joy and fulfillment.\n\nConsidering your situation, it's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what's truly important to you in a relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your deal-breakers? What are your hopes and dreams for the future?\n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's not aware of the depth of your doubts and fears. This conversation can help you both understand each other better and potentially work through some of the issues.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship that makes you happy and fulfilled. It's okay to take your time and figure out what that looks like for you."

We had a crush but nothing happened as we were both in long term relationships. \n\nFast forward to today, we meet again and we're both single. Chemistry is strong, and we start dating a month ago. Although (and he's been clear since the beginning), he meanwhile had a 7-year old boy, and still lives with his ex as she financially depends on him and he still wants to protect her in some way.\n\nThey've been separated for 2 years, and he didn't have any new gf since, as his situation is quite... special. Although he'd like to change that, have a life on his own again, which would start with split apartments, even if not too far from each other for the sake of their child.\n\nToday, he drove his ex and child to his ex parents-in-law. He had to spend the night there before taking the road the morning after. They were surprised when he asked for a spare bedroom, and apparently surprised to see him and their daughter separated at all. On her end, she's quite upset anytime he mentions that he'd like to live on his own. His theory is that she was ok for him to have one-night stand, but might have wished a reconciliation in the end. That and the fact that she's been financially dependent on him for the past 13 years.\n\nI'm lost, as this is a heavy baggage to carry in the beginning of a relationship.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that his situation is a significant red flag. Living with an ex, even if they're separated, can create a power imbalance in the relationship. His financial dependence on her, her emotional attachment to him, and her resistance to him moving on can create a toxic dynamic.\n\nIt's also crucial to consider your own emotional well-being and boundaries. You've only been dating for a month, and you've only seen each other twice due to your work commitments. You need to prioritize your own emotional safety and ensure that you're not getting swept up in the romance without considering the long-term implications.\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with someone who is still emotionally tied to his ex?\n2.

Ask him about his expectations for your relationship, his plans for his living situation, and how he envisions his future with you.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. If you're not comfortable with the situation, it's essential to re-evaluate whether this relationship is right for you.

I'm happy to help you explore some strategies to manage this symptom.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the fight-or-flight response is a natural reaction to perceived threats or stressors. However, when it becomes a frequent or debilitating issue, it's crucial to find ways to regulate your response.\n\nHere are some techniques that might help you reduce the spinning sensation:\n\n1. **Breathing exercises**: When you start feeling the spinning, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce the sympathetic response.\n2. **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. This can help release physical tension and reduce the spinning sensation.\n3. **Visualization**: Close your eyes and visualize a calm, peaceful environment. Imagine yourself in a safe, relaxing space, and focus on the sensory details (e.g., the sound of waves, the smell of a forest, or the feeling of sand between your toes). This can help distract your brain from the spinning and promote relaxation.\n4. **Grounding techniques**: Use your senses to ground yourself in the present moment. For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin. This can help anchor you in the present and reduce the spinning.\n5. **Physical movement**: Engage in some gentle physical activity, like stretching, yoga, or a short walk. This can help release tension and reduce the spinning sensation.\n6. **Mindfulness meditation**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you develop greater awareness of your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, including the fight-or-flight response. This can help you recognize when you're starting to spin and take steps to calm down before it gets out of control.\n7. **Biofeedback**: Consider working with a therapist or using a biofeedback device that provides visual or auditory feedback to help you become more aware of your body's physiological responses, including heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity. This can help you learn to recognize when you're starting to spin and take steps to calm down.\n8. **Cognitive reappraisal**: Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive or neutral light. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try to reframe your thoughts to focus on the present moment and the resources you have available to handle the situation.\n\nRemember, it may take some experimentation to find the techniques that work best for you. Be patient, and don't be afraid to seek professional help if the spinning persists and interferes with your daily life.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to address the root causes of your fight-or-flight responses, such as stress, anxiety, or trauma. Working with a therapist or counselor can help you develop coping strategies and address underlying issues.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your well-being. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it's essential to step away and recharge before returning to the situation."

My girlfriend of three and a half years broke up with me today. She seems happy with the decision and I'm glad that she is. But I feel, well, shitty. Lost, sad, you name it. I saw it coming for a week or so, but that didn't make this any easier. I would like some words of advice for these next few weeks, or months. Thanks.",
    "human": "Hey bro sorry to hear about the split...sucks but we've all been there.\n\nHere's a few things I did when I broke up with my first long term relationship.\n\n- Think about if things have actually been going well as of late. Like actually sit down and truly think about it. Usually, aside from a particular event like someone cheating, relationships fall apart when there is something critical missing. Try and pinpoint what those things are...when you do, it will help to put things in perspective and you may realize this actually is for the best\n- Spend as much time focused on specific goals. Gym, school, work, friends.....distract yourself for the first month or two...it will get easier after a few weeks I guarantee you\n- Meet another girl. I know this may sound \"cold\" and you may still have feelings for your girlfriend but man, just hooking up with a chick YOU LIKE will make you feel better. I stress \"girl you like\" because hooking up with someone you aren't attracted to or aren't in to wont really do anything...when you get intimate or go on a date with someone you DO like, it helps solidify the fact that your life will get better, you will find someone else and will help the healing process\n\nAnother thing to really stress:\nDon't contact your now ex. Don't try and call her to \"work things out\". Don't get drunk and show up at her place. Delete her number. If you truly cut contact, she WILL resurface. I guarantee you this. Girls who spend years with someone will always have a soft spot for an ex so long as they don't grow to hate him. By not contacting her you get a couple things: \n\n- You heal with time\n- You seem like you have your shit together and are a confident, complete person without her which dramatically increases the odds of her resurfacing. If she does resurface, you can then decide if you actually want to get back together\n\nAnd after a little time, and with newly gained perspective, you may realize it was for the best and meet someone new.\n\ngood luck!",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about your breakup. It's completely normal to feel lost, sad, and confused after a long-term relationship ends. It's okay to feel whatever emotions arise, and it's great that you're acknowledging them.\n\nFirstly, allow yourself to process your emotions. It's essential to feel the pain, anger, or whatever emotions come your way. Suppressing them won't help; instead, try to ride the waves of your emotions. Take time to reflect on the relationship, the memories, and the moments that brought you joy. This can help you gain closure and acceptance.\n\nIt's also crucial to focus on self-care during this period. Take care of your physical and mental well-being by getting enough sleep, eating healthily, and engaging in activities that bring you comfort and relaxation. Exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature can be great ways to clear your mind.\n\nReaching out to friends and family can be helpful, but be cautious of seeking validation or reassurance from your ex or mutual friends. It's essential to surround yourself with people who can offer a fresh perspective and support you without taking sides or fueling your emotions.\n\nRemember that grief is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Don't put pressure on yourself to 'get over it' or'move on' within a specific timeframe. Healing takes time, and it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself.\n\nLastly, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. You can't change the past or your ex's decisions, but you can control how you react to the situation. Practice self-compassion, and remind yourself that you're strong and capable of navigating this challenging time.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel lost, and it's okay to ask for help. You got this, and you'll come out stronger on the other side.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any particular concerns you have during this time?"

It's normal to feel this way when you're in a relationship and something like this happens. The fact that you're feeling this way doesn't mean you're a bad person or that there's anything wrong with you.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your husband's response to your concerns was not very helpful. Saying \"don't say that, it breaks my heart\" can come across as dismissive and minimizing of your feelings. He needs to understand that you're not saying this to hurt him, but because you're genuinely feeling scared and unsure.\n\nNow, as for why you might be feeling this way, it's possible that the fight has brought up some underlying insecurities or fears that you may have been avoiding or suppressing. It's also possible that you're feeling unfulfilled or unhappy in the relationship, and the fight has made you realize that you're not getting the emotional intimacy or connection you need.\n\nI would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you really want and need in your relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your deal-breakers?

It's not about being confrontational or aggressive, but about being clear and respectful in expressing your needs and opinions. Remember, you're not just a good listener, but also a valuable contributor to the conversation.\n\nTo overcome your tendency to go into passive listening mode, try these strategies:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Before the conversation, take a few minutes to gather your thoughts, identify your key points, and practice articulating them. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.\n2. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you're always wrong,\" say \"I feel frustrated when...\" or \"I think we should consider...\" This helps to focus on your own emotions and experiences, rather than attacking the other person.\n3. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" or \"I'm not comfortable with that\" when necessary.

Remember that it's okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding.\n7. **Role-play with a friend**: Practice having tough conversations with a trusted friend or family member. This will help you build confidence and develop your assertiveness skills in a low-stakes environment.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to break the habit of people-pleasing.

We are definitely out of the lusty new couple phase and maybe have been fighting a bit more than usual lately.\n\nThe meat of it is that she went to Bali with her stepdad, step dad's girlfriend and step dad's girlfriend's son. I couldn't go because of classes that I'm taking. The Airbnb they were staying at had only two beds, which she informed me of when she got there, that she would be sleeping in the same bed with the son. She assured me that I had nothing to worry about and I trusted her. I've always felt really confident in the strength of our relationship so I didn't think twice. So they end up having sex about a week into a two-week trip. She tells me that it didn't happen just once but somewhere around 10 times over the course of the rest of the trip... \n\nI'm obviously devastated by this news. I freaked out, flipped a coffee table, broke a lamp, broke a beer bottle and punched a hole in a door. Not at all proud about any of that.\n\nShe tells me she's sorry, she regrets it all and that she still wants to pursue a relationship with me if I could ever forgive her.

It's essential to acknowledge that you're not defined by this incident, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person.\n\nRegarding your concerns about whether your relationship can be salvaged, it's crucial to consider the following:\n\n1. Your girlfriend's actions: Her infidelity is a significant betrayal, and it's essential to understand that her choices have consequences. While she may regret her actions, it's crucial to assess whether she's truly committed to making amends and working on herself.\n2. Your own feelings and boundaries: You've stated that you still love her dearly, but it's vital to recognize that your feelings may evolve over time. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set clear boundaries to ensure your own healing and growth.\n3.

Set clear boundaries: It's essential to communicate your expectations and boundaries clearly to your girlfriend, and ensure that she respects them.\n3. Focus on personal growth: Encourage your girlfriend to work on herself, including addressing her addiction and personal issues.\n4. Evaluate your feelings regularly: As you work through the aftermath, it's crucial to regularly assess your feelings and boundaries to ensure that you're not compromising your own well-being.\n\nRemember, healing takes time, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being throughout the process. It's not about \"making things work\" for the sake of staying in the relationship; it's about creating a healthy, fulfilling partnership that benefits both individuals.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself for your reaction.

So, it's been a little over 3 months since I posted. To quickly recap, my boyfriend had purchased a house with his brother and sister in law about a year ago - just a few months before I was in a relationship with him so I had no say in the matter since I was not around. A big 4-family victorian that they wanted to convert into a 2 family, the majority of the space and house decisions going to his brother. Obviously, I was not okay with this arrangement for a multitude of reasons...but there wasn't much I could do besides voice my input.\n\nAfter reading through all of your responses on my original post, which I was super appreciative of, I decided to hold off on moving in with him. It was not a situation I wanted to move into immediately until I got a better feel for how things would go between him and his brother + house. I also have a very nice apartment and do not want to give that up so fast. My boyfriend was definitely a bit bummed when I told him but he understood.\n\nSo...I decided to wait things out and see if my boyfriend would naturally come to to terms with the fact that long term it wouldn't be a good decision for us as a couple. A few of you had said since his heart was invested in the house and there wasn't much persuasion I could have on him. I did not push him on anything. I just let his brother's bad decisions and my boundaries do the talking. For example, if we were to move into the upstairs unit together, my boyfriend originally wanted to open up a door to the other side into the brothers unit. He said the brother wouldn't come through and that it would be private for us. I firmly disagreed and lamented on the current facts of how the situation is downstairs with the same kind of hotel door pathway to his side. (dog barking noise, invasion, not exactly private or \"our space\"). He eventually agreed to not open up the door and only have the front door...AKA a normal house, not a hotel... His brother is also pretty rash so he frequently will start up drama with him through text messages.\n\nWell just last week, his brother decided to text him and basically said \"I don't think the house is going to work out. I am not going to be happy with the house with how things are going now. You are at \\[GFs\\] house all the time. she just wants her own private getaway. she doesnt seem to get along with the dogs. etc...\" To which my boyfriend said yes, i think it would be healthier for me and \\[GF\\] to get our own house. Therefore, there is no more talk of us moving into that house permanently!!! I was SOOOO relieved it came from his brother because I did not have to push him out of it, his brother did. Which FYI - my boyfriend is only at my apartment 1-2 nights max a week. I am deathly allergic to the dogs so yeah i avoid them. AND YES i want my house to be my private getaway...idk why he painted that in a negative tone. My boyfriend was actually relieved, too. Now our talks have switched to us coming together as a couple and figuring out how to save up for a house in 2 years. Which fixed my concern of thinking he only cared about the house first...\n\nAlthough I gotta vent a bit - I'm bummed that his brother essentially stole this time from him and money as well... He had money for a home before he put it all on this one. Now we have to wait for his brother to pay back his share. Also, he can't be considered on another mortgage until they refinance the house and remove him...in 2 years... I do make a good salary and have excellent credit so I could potentially qualify for a mortgage on my own. We just need to wait, save, and pray that the NY housing market simmers down. It just sucks that his brother has really come in-between him starting his own life. That's how it feels at least. It feels one sided, his brother seemed to call all the shots and now my bf is paying for it. At this point, the issues are financial. His brother is a vet who makes more than double my boyfriend, yet he does not pay most of the mortgage. My boyfriend has been floating most of the mortgage payments, paying for a new roof, etc. He can't pay off his credit cards because of the money tied to paying the roof. They are all essentially in a financial hard spot. \n\nOverall though - this is excellent news... I'm just glad I won't have to move in there forever. My boyfriend would still like me to move into his apartment soon though for the meantime to help us save up. I'm still on the fence cause I don't like the situation. We were going to do a month trial run of me staying over, see what issues I have, fix them before I move in. Or I just say no entirely and not move in. He is in a financial pinch right now but I don't want to move in based on that alone. Even though it would be temporary - but 2 years is quite a long time. I would rather pay the rent at my place for my own sanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I think there is some confusion based on some of the replies I've read - my boyfriend still lives in the house they bought together. He is not being kicked out, he will still live there until me and him were to find a place to call home.  So he is staying there and i'm at staying my apartment still until we make a decision on if i move in with him or vice versa, or if we just stay put where are are. Not rushing that part. so the good about this update is we plan on buying our own home in the future together if all goes well. Him and the brother are trying to work through the issues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Boyfriend and brother decided to separate from the house they bought together. Therefore, me and my boyfriend could buy our own house instead.",

It's understandable that your boyfriend is struggling to make ends meet, but it's not fair that he's shouldering the bulk of the financial burden.

This will help you navigate any challenges that come your way.\n4. **Consider the potential consequences**: Think about the potential consequences of dating a coworker, such as gossip, rumors, or even a hostile work environment. Make sure you're prepared for the potential fallout.\n\nDON'T:\n\n1. **Don't start a relationship with someone you're not ready for**: If you're not emotionally ready or mature enough to handle the challenges of a workplace romance, it's best to wait until you're in a better place.\n2. **Don't compromise your professionalism**: Remember that your work relationships with your partner and colleagues should remain professional. Avoid flaunting your relationship or making others feel uncomfortable.\n3. **Don't ignore the power dynamics**: Be aware of the power imbalance that can exist in a workplace relationship. Make sure you're not taking advantage of your partner's position or vice versa.\n4. **Don't let your relationship become a distraction**: Keep your relationship separate from your work life. Avoid discussing personal issues or conflicts at work, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\nAs for whether you should \"just don't go there,\" it ultimately depends on your individual circumstances and priorities. If you're not prepared to handle the potential consequences or complications, it might be best to avoid dating a coworker. However, if you're mature, responsible, and willing to navigate the challenges, a workplace romance can be a unique and rewarding experience.\n\nRemember, honesty, communication, and mutual respect are key to making a workplace romance work. If you're unsure about the potential risks or consequences, it's always best to err on the side of caution and prioritize your well-being and professional relationships."

    "sentence": "how to start convos with the opposite sex without coming off as weird, random, or creepy? I'm in my 2nd year at my university and I've been single for an entire year. I'm a male. I am having trouble meeting girls.. In high school I always had a ton of girls but since college I've had trouble. I'm an average to slightly above average looking guy who's in good shape. I see cute girls in class everyday and everyday at the gym but I don't even know what to say to start a convo or even ask them out. I hate rejection (I've actually never been rejected because I try to avoid it). These girls I see in the gym are my\nIdeal type - in shape and hard workers. How can I slowly start talking to them without coming off as creepy or weird! A lot of them have headphones in too but there's gotta be a way.. I'm outgoing and funny but I just feel like if I go up to someone randomly and talk it'll come off as weird. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips?",
    "human": "The same way you would start a conversation with somebody the same gender as you. It's when you behave differently meeting somebody just because they are a different gender that you will automatically -always- come off as weird, random, or creepy.  \n \nWhen you behave differently towards a woman than you would a man, it is instantly obvious that you want something from them that you wouldn't want from a man. So of course they will think you're creepy.  Because that's what you're being.   \n\nWhen you approach them as if you thought they were a fellow human being, you will seem less threatening, less creepy, and more normal.  \n\nAnd you're going to be rejected. Who cares? Forget it and move on.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it, it can be tough to navigate starting conversations with people you're interested in, especially when you're not used to it. First of all, kudos to you for acknowledging your feelings and wanting to improve!\n\nHere's the thing: you don't need to be super outgoing or a natural-born charmer to start conversations. You can start small and build your way up. Since you're already a regular at the gym, why not start by striking up a conversation with someone you see there regularly? You can try finding common ground, like asking about their workout routine or a particular exercise they're doing. Keep it light and casual, and see where the conversation goes from there.\n\nAs for the headphones situation, don't worry about it too much. If someone's wearing headphones, they might not even notice you approaching, and if they do, they might appreciate the interruption! You can try making eye contact, smiling, and then approaching them when they're taking their headphones off or putting them away. This way, you can break the ice and start a conversation.\n\nAnother tip is to focus on the person, not just their physical appearance. Ask them about their interests, hobbies, or passions outside of the gym. This can help you build a connection and create a conversation that's more meaningful than just talking about your shared interest in working out.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take things slow and not push for a date or anything too intense right away. Just focus on building a rapport and getting to know the person as a friend. You can always gauge their interest and see where things go from there.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go as planned. Rejection is a natural part of life, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Just learn from your experiences and keep working on improving your social skills.\n\nOh, and one more thing: try to be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it can be a major turn-off. Just relax, be authentic, and have fun with it!"

    "sentence": "**TLDR: Super religious family forced me to wear hijab, restricted me from basically everything and were physically/emotionally abusive to me growing up. Officially went no-contact at 25 but now my uncle has reached out and I'm wavering.**\n\nSo   I was raised in a fundamental Muslim household (Salafi Islam) my  entire  life and it wasn't until my early 20s that I was able to escape  the  clutches of that religion.\n\nMy   upbringing was quite restrictive, I was forced to wear hijab at the  age  of 8 (really I was manipulated into \"asking for it\" and that was  held  against me for over a decade), I was also forced to attend \"dugsi\"  which  is essential Sat/Sun religious classes where you forced to  memorize the  Quran in Arabic (not my native tongue btw)  and if you  faltered or made  too many mistakes you would be beaten by a stick ...  you'd also be hit if you giggled or laughed in class so basically I was  beaten all the time and if I told my mom she would inevitably take the  side of the teacher and beat me herself at the end of it.\n\nBecause   I was born a girl a lot of my childhood was restricted, I wasn't able   to wear pants or go out with friends to the movies or do anything  really  outside of the home (with the exception of school my parents  weren't  complete monsters). I was also told that I was effectively  lesser  because of my gender and that my only purpose was to be a good  daughter  and inevitable wife. Any disobedience was strictly dealt with,  first  with physical beatings but eventually with harsh words and  emotional  abuse. Even things like riding a bike or swimming were  restricted, which sucked as I was very athletic growing up.\n\nInevitably in my teens I rebelled *hard.*   The catalyst was that I was in honours' courses in HS and had great   grades but I was struggling in math (85%+ average in all my courses but   sadly only a 73% in math) and my mother promised that I could have my   first ever birthday party (sweet 16s were super trendy when I went to school and growing up it was haram to celebrate birthdays so I never had any presents or parties or even a HBD so at the time this felt like a hill worth dying over) if I could get my math grade high enough. I was about 2% shy of   the grade my parents wanted me to make, so instead of a party I was   \"allowed\" to obtain my learner's permit with no drivers training or   opportunity to learn on their car so the license was effectively   useless.\n\nAt that point I realized   that my family would always move the goal posts and that asking for  permission would get me nowhere. I had an older brother  who did  terribly in school and he would never get punished but would  rather be  celebrated whenever he would do even the smallest thing right  (i.e if  he got a \"most improved\" award we would go out to celebrate but  if I  had only english/humanities awards my mother would be disappointed  that  I didn't get better awards in math/sciences and just sigh and wish   that my more successful classmates were her kids instead. Despite having   a summer job I was never allowed to buy my own clothes, I was never   allowed to go out with friends to the movies or do anything innocent so I   decided I would stop caring to ask and would just do them.\n\nThat   culminated in my family sending me to their country of origin after   discovering that I had drank alcohol when I was 17. I was essentially  tricked and held prisoner for several months until I was able to contact   the Canadian embassy who rescued me and brought me back home.\n\nI   felt guilty for leaving them and since I was still a teen with little   to no prospects I ended up moving back in to complete my final year of   HS. They all held this over my head and made me beg for forgiveness.  Unfortunately at the time I believed I was completely in the wrong so I  did just that.\n\nFast forward a year  later, I was attending a local university met my  now husband and moved  out with him by 20 (they were ok with this  because he was also from a  muslim background despite not being raised in  a religious household at  all). I truly believe that I wouldn't have  gotten married so young if I  didn't have such religious family and  whilst I am still very much in  love and in a happy marriage...it could  have gone far worse and I  could've trapped myself in an abusive  relationship. Would never  recommend my future children to marry so young  as not everyone's story  ends up as happily as mine did.\n\nBy   the time I hit 23 I had lived away from home for 3 years and had  slowly  been cutting my family out of my life. I would start visiting  them  without hijab or a long skirt and would take months between visits  and  calls despite living in the same city. By the time I was 25, I was   completely out of the religion of Islam and honestly quite bitter and   angry for the years I wasted worshipping a deity who hated women, the   LGBTQ+ community and basically anyone who wasn't a \"true muslim\". So I   refused to keep in any contact with my family, even going as far as to   move (but did not change my number).\n\nI   felt bad for cutting off all members of my family as I was honestly  not  strong enough for the confrontations and the manipulations and  figured  that a full cut off was best. Sadly this meant my own siblings  were cut  off as well. I attempted at 27 to get back in touch with my  older  brother but he was angry and felt that I abandoned him so he had  some  really cruel words to say so I decided to stop trying.\n\nAnother   year or so has gone by and I messed up by picking up the phone the   other day after several missed calls from a new number (I have a rule to   always pick up if the same number calls back more than once in the   event that someone I know or care about might be in trouble). It was one  my uncles who wanted to reopen our relationship. This uncle was one   that was a bit of a kindred spirit and felt more *human* in a sense...he wasn't as religious as the rest of them and understood how strict our family was.\n\nHe   mentioned how my parents are aging and that they are incredibly sad to   not be in contact with me and that I was always the \"favourite\" IDK  why  I'm being called the favourite now because I know for a fact that  my  older brother was given more freedom and less responsibility growing  up.  But I cannot help but feel so guilty, since they are getting older  and  there is so much economic uncertainty in Canada at the moment.\n\nI'm  struggling to decide whether to continue estrangement knowing that my  parents are sad and want  to see me again. My uncle says that I'll be  haunted by this decision  later on in life if I do not reconcile with  them now. But it's hard to  want reconciliation with people who I know  for a fact haven't changed.  Islam is really a poison and it ruined our  relationship. If they weren't  so religious (seriously more religious  than even their own parents were  to them) then perhaps we could've  moved on but I'm pregnant now (nobody  knows in my life apart from my  doctor, best friend and husband) and  don't want them to hurt my  daughter like how they hurt them.\n\n\\-------\n\n**EDIT (Dec 07, 2022):**\n\nI'm really surprised at the number responses, I didn't expect more than a few people to respond so this has all been overwhelming (but in a good way!)\n\nWanted to take some time to answer some of the questions and respond to some of the comments made below (there are too many at this point for me to answer each comment individually).\n\n1) I am not in fear of my life. I have been married at this point for over 8 years soon to be 9 and my family was all present at my wedding.  My family met and liked my husband and I do not believe that they would try to kidnap me or sell me off like some of the posts are suggesting. I'm a married woman and not a 17 year old virgin so in the eyes of any prospective suitors I am \"used goods\". My family was very abusive to me but the abuse was when I was a teenager. For some reason in my culture we are particularly cruel to young women. Now that I am an adult and an expectant mother I have zero worry that physical abuse would come my way. In addition to the above, my family doesn't take my apostasy seriously at all. They think it's my way of rebelling against my upbringing and that I will \"find my way\" in the end. I think they do this to prevent themselves from being shamed by the community. RN its just a dirty little secret like my brother's sexuality and I'm so far removed from them at this point that I don't care if that's what they need to tell themselves to sleep at night.\n\nDespite saying that, I would still never agree to travel with my family again or meet them in a location that was not vetted by me or meet them without my husband. Whilst I do not believe I would be in any danger I'm not a dummy and wouldn't take such a silly risk.\n\n2) For the people dm'ing me that my husband is probably abusive and that I am repeating the cycle. Please stop, this is quite hurtful and insulting to both me and the love of my life. I definitely got married at such an early age because I wanted to escape and live with my now husband who was and still is my best friend and confident. But we would've moved in regardless, we are and still are crazy in love lol.\n\nAnd he was and still is completely supportive because he was raised in a muslim majority country but his family is super liberal (our shared beliefs on the religion of islam is really what drew us together in the beginning and he was the first person who made me realize just how awful and abnormal my upbringing was). He is and will forever be my biggest supporter. In fact, I believe I fell in love with him because he was the exact opposite of all the men I interacted with growing up (kind, caring, no toxic masculinity).\n\n3) To the people trying to excuse Islam and trying to convert me in my dm's. STOP. Whilst I do not believe that every muslim household treats women the way that my family did. The reason I left islam completely isn't just because of my family. I kept within the fold of Islam until 2015 or so during the height of ISIS. So much of the horrific things committed by that terrorist organization was not only sanctioned in the Quran and Sunnah (i.e. slavery) but encouraged (we are expected to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet and emulate him and his companions actions as they are considered the \"best of all mankind\"), once I was able to get away from my family and critically think about what was inside the religion that was shoved down my throat I quickly realized that I could not in good conscience believe in this faith. So no, I will never ever convert to Islam and I hold a deep hatred and resentment to this religion and all the suffering it has caused my people (we were historically never Salafi, Somalis were Sufi muslims and practiced a much tamer and spiritual form of Islam before the civil war which is unfortunately the story of many muslim countries like Afghanistan)\n\n4) How does nobody know that I am pregnant? It's because I work from home. I have since COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns decided to really protect my peace. This meant drastically reducing my social media presence and cutting off many former friends who I realized where either not supportive or just generally detrimental to my mental health. My best friend knows, my husband, doctor and my employer will be notified in the new year. I don't think anyone else has to know. Maybe my neighbours have guessed since I have started to show but I'm not particularly close to my neighbours so idc.\n\n5) Am I afraid that someone will figure out who I am from this post? Not really, again I pretty much keep to myself and have kept certain things vague enough to prevent myself from being discovered. If this post does get back to my family...well I hope they read the comments and reflect.\n\nAND FINALLY...\n\nThank you all so so much. I took the time to read every single reply with my husband and we have decided to not only continue estrangement but to also include my uncle in this as well. I was clearly blinded by the desire of seeing some of my family members again but I didn't take the time to think about what that would mean for me, my future daughter and my husband. I will never agree to be my family's caregiver and it is not my responsibility to do so. It's crazy how after all this time, I can still rationalize the abuse but this thread and all the kind comments in it made me realize that I need to be firm.\n\nWe're in the process of closing on a new home in a different part of the country so I will hold off on changing my number until the move (early 2023) but I have after sending a long text to my uncle, blocked him. The catalyst was that he sent me a whatsapp message with heavy religious undertones...clearly he's changed since I last saw him.\n\n(P.S. Regarding the whole favourite thing I know it made me sound a little petty when I say that I was geniunely surprised but I guess a part of me still felt like a kid wanting validation from their parents. I was always told my personality was too \"masculine\" and my brother's was too \"feminine\" but truthfully even if they did like my personality, they hated that it was combined with my gender so I doubt I was ever the favourite. The \"favourite\" would've been treated better (also being called the favourite is such an insult to my younger siblings who from my memory were kind, sweet and gentle souls that I miss dearly). )",
    "human": "Did your family have a tradition of the women taking in their aging relatives? Is that why you're the favorite now??? I don't know a thing here but in my family a lot of the time the \"girls\" end up taking care of their parents even if the boy was and remained the favorite. \nI don't know, it could be legit &amp; they are sad now that they are older. It just doesn't seem likely to me. Whatever you do is the right choice for you, just protect yourself - advice from one people pleaser to another!",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about the abuse and trauma you experienced in your childhood and adolescence. It's completely understandable that you would feel guilty about cutting off your family, especially given the toxic dynamics you grew up in. However, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety above all else.\n\nI want to acknowledge that you're not obligated to reconcile with your family just because they're getting older or because they're sad about not being in contact with you. You have every right to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. It's not your responsibility to care for your parents or make them happy; they had that responsibility as your caregivers.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your family's behavior towards you was abusive and manipulative, and it's not your fault that you didn't have a healthy relationship with them. You did the best you could with the resources you had, and it's okay to acknowledge that you were a victim of abuse.\n\nI understand that your uncle's outreach may have triggered some feelings of guilt and responsibility, but it's important to remember that you're not obligated to engage with him or anyone else who may be trying to manipulate or control you. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you don't have to tolerate toxic behavior from anyone.\n\nI'm glad that you're considering your own needs and priorities, and I encourage you to continue setting boundaries and prioritizing your own well-being.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Take a step back**: Stop sending aggressive or frequent texts. This might seem counterintuitive, but giving him space might help him reflect on his actions and take responsibility.\n2. **Set clear boundaries**: Have a calm and direct conversation with him when you see him in person. Explain how his behavior is affecting you and reiterate that you need the money back. Be specific about the amount borrowed and the time frame. Avoid blaming or accusing language.\n3. **Seek mediation (if necessary)**: If talking to him directly doesn't work, consider asking a mutual friend or a trusted authority figure to help facilitate a conversation. This might provide a more neutral and supportive environment for resolving the issue.\n4. **Consider a compromise**: If your classmate is unable to pay back the full amount, discuss alternative solutions, such as a payment plan or a reduced amount. This might be a more realistic and compassionate approach, especially considering his addiction struggles.\n5. **Protect yourself financially**: Don't invest more emotional energy or financial resources into this situation. Consider transferring the borrowed amount to a savings account or a separate account, and avoid lending him money again.\n6. **Focus on self-care**: Take care of yourself during this process. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice stress-reducing techniques, and prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nRemember, you can't control others' behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. By prioritizing your own emotional and financial well-being, you'll be better equipped to handle the situation and potentially find a resolution.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Is there anything specific that resonates with you, or is there anything you'd like to add or change?"

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 months but I keep realizing that I am putting in more effort than he is. I am always the one to ask for dates, plan those dates, text first, text at all, go up to him, want to see him, etc. We last hung out almost 4 weeks ago, at first it was because his parents punished him and took away his phone, then he was stressed about school (which I understand) and now... he hasn't said anything.

You deserve to feel seen and heard in your relationship, and it's not okay for someone to consistently take you for granted.\n\nAs for whether this is normal, I'd say it's not ideal, but it's not uncommon either. Unfortunately, some people can be inconsistent or lazy in their relationships, especially when they're not feeling challenged or threatened.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. Take a step back and assess the relationship: Ask yourself if this is the kind of dynamic you want to continue in the long run. Are you okay with being the one initiating everything and putting in all the effort? If not, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship and consider what you want from it.\n2. Communicate your feelings: Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing him. For example, \"Hey, I've noticed we haven't hung out in a while, and I'm starting to feel a bit lonely and uncared for. Can we make an effort to spend more time together?\" Be specific about what you need from him and what you're willing to do to make it work.\n3. Set boundaries: If your boyfriend doesn't respond or doesn't make an effort to change, it's okay to set boundaries. You don't have to keep reaching out or initiating dates if it's not reciprocated.

Take time to focus on your own interests, hobbies, and goals. You might discover new passions or connections that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n5. Don't be afraid to walk away: If the relationship is consistently one-sided and doesn't show signs of improvement, it might be time to reevaluate whether this is a healthy and fulfilling relationship for you. You deserve someone who values and respects you, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, you're not being dramatic or overreacting.

Here's a simple trick that might help you keep your cool and stay focused: take a deep breath before responding.\n\nWhen you feel yourself getting worked up, pause for a split second, inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This simple pause can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.\n\nAnother strategy is to practice active listening. When your boss or coworker is speaking, make an effort to really listen to what they're saying, rather than preparing your response. Repeat back what you've understood from their perspective, and ask clarifying questions to ensure you're on the same page. This can help you stay focused and avoid getting defensive.\n\nFinally, try to reframe your mindset. Instead of viewing these conversations as \"heated discussions,\" think of them as opportunities to learn and grow. Remember that your goal is to find a solution that works for everyone involved, not to \"win\" an argument.\n\nAs for articulating your needs, try to focus on specific, concrete examples rather than general complaints. For instance, instead of saying \"I feel overwhelmed with work,\" say \"I'm struggling to meet the deadline for this project because I have too many tasks on my plate. Can we discuss possible adjustments or priorities?\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to take a moment to collect your thoughts before responding. You can say something like, \"Can I take a moment to think about that? I want to make sure I'm responding thoughtfully.\" By staying calm, listening actively, and focusing on solutions, you can navigate even the most intense conversations with confidence and clarity."

    "sentence": "My fiancée and I have been together for 5 years.\n\nLast night when my she and I were heading up to bed, I went to go pee quickly and when I came back my fiancée was pulling a weird face, like she was trying not to laugh. She said “I may have done an oops.” I asked her what she meant and she said “I was just scrolling through instagram stories and somebody posted a picture of some concert tickets so I replied to their story saying it I hate that venue, but I didn’t check who posted it before I replied and it turned out it was H.”\n\nA little context: H (24M I think?) is my fiancée’s former FWB and obsession, she was desperate for his attention and really wanted to date him, but he was into someone else so all he offered her was sex and she figured that was better than nothing. Early on in my relationship with my fiancée he talked to her and tried to get her to cheat on me (she didn’t), telling her that I was probably cheating anyway (I wasn’t). She stopped talking to him and over time he kind of became a running joke in our relationship, my fiancée would laugh and say things like “I can’t believe I was obsessed with HIM of all people,” she seemed pretty embarrassed about it, like she cringes when she thinks about it.\n\nSo, she told me she accidentally replied to his instagram story not realising who he was. I said okay. Then she said that he had responded asking her if she wants to meet up for coffee. I kinda chuckle at that, thinking it’s funny he got the wrong end of the stick and thought she was trying to “reignite” something despite the fact that she’s engaged to me and we have a young daughter together. But then my fiancée said, “Unless you would find that too uncomfortable?” And then I clock what she’s getting at. I ask her if she’s already agreed to go and she says yes, so I ask why. She said it’s something to do that will get her out of the house, and she wouldn’t mind having at least one friend. I figure that’s hard to argue with, she spends all day at home looking after our daughter when I’m at work, and she doesn’t really have anyone to speak to in that time, so I get why some social interaction would appeal. So while I am uncomfortable with it, I would feel too bad stopping her because I know how lonely she gets. I tell her I don’t mind and she can go if she wants. And that’s the end of the conversation, but it keeps bothering me.\n\nThe more I think about it, the weirder the story seems. She just replied to people‘s instagram stories without even knowing who she’s messaging? Sounds unlikely. I figure maybe he messaged her first but she didn’t want to admit to me that she replied to him? I don’t know, but it was bothering me a lot. So I did something I’m not proud of; I checked her phone while she was asleep.\n\nIt turns out that she really did start the conversation by replying to his story, but after his initial reply SHE was the one who asked HIM to go for coffee. Their conversation continues, she talks about how she’ll have to bring our daughter if it’s a weekday but not if it’s a weekend (because I could stay home with her at the weekend, although she doesn’t mention me at any point), and they arrange to meet on Tuesday. All of this happened not only before she asked if I was okay with it, but while I had been sitting next to her the whole time!\n\nI feel super uncomfortable about the whole thing, especially because she lied to me that it was his idea. Plus I don’t know what’s weirder, taking my daughter with her to meet him, or making me look after her while she does.\n\nI honestly do not believe that she would ever cheat on me. Last week she made herself cry by IMAGINING that she accidentally broke something of mine, so I think cheating on me is well beyond her. But it just seems so weird and uncomfortable to me, made worse by the fact that she lied. I just don’t know how to talk to her about it without revealing that I read her messages while she was asleep, that can’t end well for me. So what do I do? How do I approach this?\n\n**TL;DR my fiancée told me her former FWB invited her to go for coffee, when I checked her messages I discovered she was the one who asked him, and they made all the plans to meet before she even told me about it, now I don’t know how to approach the situation**",
    "human": "If she told a lie about how the meeting came about, how do you know she was being truthful about the emotional reaction she showed you? (to imagining breaking one of your things)\n\nThe key difference is that you don’t know how much her reaction was to influence you.",
    "base_reply": "I can sense your unease and discomfort. It's understandable that you're struggling with how to approach this situation. Before we dive into what to do, let's acknowledge that your fiancée's actions were indeed weird and concerning. The fact that she lied to you and didn't mention me at all during the conversation is a red flag.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to have a calm and non-accusatory conversation with your fiancée. Avoid blaming or attacking her, as this can escalate the situation. Instead, express your feelings and concerns in a non-judgmental way. You could start by saying something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation the other day. I've been thinking about it a lot, and I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable. I know you told me that H invited you to coffee, but when I checked your messages, I saw that you actually initiated the conversation. I understand that you might have been feeling lonely and wanted some social interaction, but I'm worried about the way you handled it. You didn't mention me at all during the conversation, and that made me feel left out.\"\n\nBe specific about what specifically bothers you, such as the fact that she lied to you, didn't mention you, and planned the meeting without your knowledge. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions about her motivations.\n\nIt's crucial to listen to her perspective and try to understand why she made these choices. She might have felt embarrassed or ashamed about her past with H, which could have led her to hide the truth. She might also have been trying to avoid conflict or make you feel uncomfortable.\n\nRemember that you're not trying to \"catch\" her in a lie or make her feel guilty, but rather to understand the situation and find a way to move forward. You might need to have multiple conversations to clear the air and rebuild trust.\n\nLastly, consider having an open and honest conversation about boundaries and expectations in your relationship. You might want to discuss what you both feel comfortable with in terms of social interactions and how to handle situations like this in the future.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, communication, and trust. It's okay to make mistakes, but it's essential to learn from them and work together to strengthen your bond."

It helps him sleep and even though I suspected I would dislike it; I actually enjoy the privacy. \n\nI do, however, miss him from time to time. He would often ask me to play with his hair.

Other times, we would wake up independently in the middle of the night, make love and fall asleep in each other's arms.

It's normal to miss the intimacy and affection that comes with sharing a bed. Now, let's break down what you've shared:\n\n1. You enjoy the privacy, but miss the intimacy and affection.\n2. You miss playing with his hair, which brings him comfort and helps him fall asleep.\n3. You sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and wish you could hug him.\n4. You've had occasional, spontaneous lovemaking sessions, which feel more intimate.\n\nConsidering your husband's sleep needs, here are some suggestions to find a balance:\n\n1. **Schedule cuddle time**: Set aside a specific time each day or evening to cuddle, whether it's 15-20 minutes or an hour. This way, you can still have your intimate moments without disrupting his sleep.\n2. **Create a pre-sleep routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine that includes activities you both enjoy, like reading, meditation, or a relaxing bath. This can help signal to your husband that it's time for sleep, and you can still spend quality time together.\n3. **Gradually increase intimacy**: If you're used to cuddling and intimacy in bed, try gradually reducing the frequency or intensity of these interactions before sleep. This might help your husband adjust to the new boundaries.\n4. **Explore other forms of intimacy**: While being in bed might not be the same, you can still find ways to be intimate outside of it. Try scheduling regular date nights, taking walks, or engaging in activities you both enjoy together.\n5. **Communicate openly**: Have an open conversation with your husband about your feelings and needs. Be honest about what you're missing and what you're willing to compromise on. Listen to his perspective as well, and work together to find a balance that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, finding a balance is all about compromise and communication. By acknowledging each other's needs and boundaries, you can find a way to maintain intimacy and affection without disrupting his sleep."

It might sound a bit awkward at first, but it can help you shift the focus away from yourself.\n2. Use passive voice or third-person singular pronouns.

Here are some tips to help you cut down on complaining:\n\n1. Identify the triggers. Reflect on when and why you tend to complain. Is it when you're stressed, bored, or feeling overwhelmed? Once you're aware of your triggers, you can develop strategies to manage them.\n2. Practice gratitude. Make a conscious effort to focus on the good things in your life. Write down three things you're grateful for each day or share them with a friend. This can help shift your perspective and reduce complaining.\n3. Use the \"3-second rule\". When you feel the urge to complain, pause for three seconds before speaking. This can help you reframe your thoughts and find a more positive way to express yourself.\n4. Focus on solutions rather than problems. Instead of dwelling on what's going wrong, try to brainstorm ways to improve the situation. This can help you feel more empowered and less inclined to complain.\n5. Practice active listening. When engaging with others, make an effort to truly listen to their concerns and offer support rather than complaining about your own issues.\n\nRemember, changing habits takes time and practice.

Here are some suggestions to help you tackle the habits you mentioned:\n\n1. Spending too much and saving too little:\n\t* Start by tracking your expenses to see where your money is going. You can use apps like Mint or Personal Capital to help you stay on top of your finances.\n\t* Set a realistic budget and prioritize needs over wants. Consider implementing a 50/30/20 rule: 50% for necessities, 30% for discretionary spending, and 20% for saving and debt repayment.\n\t* Avoid impulse purchases by implementing a 30-day waiting period before buying non-essential items.\n2. Skipping the gym:\n\t* Find an exercise routine that you enjoy, whether it's running, yoga, or weightlifting. Consistency is key, so try to schedule it in your daily planner.\n\t* Start small and set achievable goals, like exercising for 10-15 minutes a day, three times a week. Gradually increase the duration and frequency as you build habits.\n\t* Find a workout buddy or accountability partner to help you stay motivated.\n3. Eating unhealthy foods:\n\t* Plan your meals in advance to avoid relying on convenience foods or impulse purchases. You can cook meals in bulk and portion them out for the week.\n\t* Identify healthy alternatives to your favorite unhealthy foods. For example, if you love pizza, try making a healthier version at home with whole-wheat crust and plenty of veggies.\n\t* Avoid emotional eating by recognizing your triggers and finding healthier coping mechanisms, such as meditation or a short walk.\n4. Not completing homework and skipping classes:\n\t* Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Create a schedule and set deadlines for yourself to stay on track.\n\t* Prioritize your most important tasks and tackle them first. Use the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat.\n\t* Find a study group or accountability partner to stay motivated and get help when needed.\n5. Being generally unproductive:\n\t* Identify your most productive hours of the day and schedule your most important tasks during that time.\n\t* Use the \"2-minute rule\": if a task can be done in less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This can help you build momentum and get more done.\n\t* Practice time-blocking: schedule large chunks of uninterrupted time to focus on important tasks.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Celebrate small victories and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. Developing discipline is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes.\n* Identify your why: what motivates you to change your habits? What will you gain by becoming more disciplined? Remind yourself of your goals often to stay motivated.\n* Be patient and consistent. Developing new habits takes time, and it's essential to be gentle with yourself as you work towards change.\n\nRemember, discipline is not about being perfect; it's about making progress and being willing to learn and adapt."

She’d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i’d pass out in her class. I couldn’t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she’d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI’m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women’s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she’d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i’m “continuing to be amazing”.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI’m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I’m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of “being groomed” makes me feel very upset, angry, almost ‘dirty’ and traumatised :(",
    "human": "I would listen to the therapist.\n\nWhat the teacher did while in school was not right. Yeah, she was there for you when you had panic attacks, anxiety, and grief, but she crossed the line and wasn't professional. She took advantage of her position.  The one thing some of these people like to do is cause confusion so they can be in control. My suggestion is to ignore her, but whatever the therapist says or thinks.  Whatever you decide to do is up to you, but I would stay away from that woman.\n\nYou have come a long way since that time, and you don't need a relapse. You're strong.  Don't be sorry for how long your post is. Look at how long my comment is. I wish you well, and have a wonderful weekend. Trust your therapist.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, upset, and angry. I'm here to help you process your feelings and thoughts.\n\nFirstly, please know that you are not in denial, and it's not your fault. Your therapist is correct in saying that you were likely groomed by your teacher. The behaviors you described, such as excessive attention, touch, and personal discussions, are all classic signs of grooming. It's not uncommon for perpetrators to make their victims feel special or loved to gain their trust.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you were a vulnerable 15-year-old who was struggling with anxiety, depression, and grief. Your teacher took advantage of that vulnerability and manipulated you into feeling a false sense of connection.\n\nThe fact that your teacher is reaching out to you now is likely a continuation of her grooming behavior. Her email is not a coincidence, and it's not about being genuinely concerned about your well-being. It's a way for her to maintain control and manipulate you further.\n\nIt's not uncommon for survivors of grooming to feel guilty, ashamed, or confused about their feelings. You may be wondering if you were \"in love\" with your teacher or if you were just vulnerable. The truth is, you were a child who was exploited and manipulated by an adult in a position of authority.\n\nRemember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel upset, angry, and confused. It's also important to recognize that you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nI want to encourage you to talk to your therapist more about this and to consider reaching out to a support group or a crisis hotline for survivors of grooming. It may also be helpful to block your teacher's email and social media accounts to protect yourself from further manipulation.\n\nRemember, you are not to blame for what happened, and you are not dirty or tainted. You are a survivor, and you deserve to be treated with respect, care, and kindness."

I saw that he had her on social media and asked him about it. I asked him how he knew her and he just brushed it off saying he didn’t know. \n\nI let it go because I didn’t think it was a big deal and trusted my then boyfriend obviously. \n\nLater down the line, I become closer with this girl and she reveals to me that they had hooked up before I started dating him. \n\nI confronted him about it and he was very apologetic. He didn’t think she would tell me and he didn’t think it was a big deal because it was in the past.\n\nHe hates talking about his past relationship and has never told me anything. This is something that’s always slightly bothered me but I’ve always tried to let it go and not pry further since he has gotten angry around his topic. \n\nThis situation made me question our relationship a lot. Even though it was in the past, it felt like a present betrayal that he lied to me about knowing her. I asked him to just be honest with me in the future. \n\nIt feels like an overreaction for this small situation to break my trust of him that much it I felt like if he could lie to me about that, he could certainly lie to me about more.\n\nA couple of months ago, I went through his phone. I don’t know why I did it. I know I shouldn’t have. But I just felt like I needed to know more information about him. After six years of being together, not knowing any of his ex’s names was getting to me. And curiosity killed the cat right?\n\nI looked through his conversation with his friends and found out he had hooked with another girl that I knew (also before we started dating). \n\nThe funny part is that I had explicitly asked him if he had done anything with her. And he told me no he did not. \n\nNow that I’ve learned that he was lying about that I just feel so betrayed all over again. \n\nI’ve been acting normal ever since I’ve found out. Showing him love and care, cooking for him and telling him how much I love him.\n\nBut in my head I question our relationship daily. I don’t think he would never cheat on me. But sometimes I don’t even think I know him. Reading his messages with his friends made him a completely different person in my head. \n\nI want to break up with him.

I feel like a gold digger for wanting to leave after he has spent so much money on me while I’ve been in college and grad school after I finally start my high paying job. We have incompatibilities but we both believe that any relationship can work out if both parties try hard enough. The second year of our relationship we nearly broke up because I was so unhappy with him. But we worked past it and everything was just fine. It’s been 6 years of trying and sometimes I just don’t know. Each year passes and I just think “this is the year it gets better or it ends” but things stay the same. Not great but not necessarily terrible. \n\nI used to dream of a fairy tale romance story but I realized practicability was a better decision.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're seeking outside perspective on this difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling torn and unsure about what to do. Here's my take:\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you did something that was not okay - snooping through your partner's phone without their consent. While I understand the curiosity, it's crucial to respect each other's privacy and boundaries. This act of snooping has likely damaged your trust in your partner, and it's natural to feel upset.\n\nRegarding the lies about his past relationships, it's clear that he has been dishonest with you. This is a significant betrayal, and it's reasonable that you're questioning the foundation of your relationship. His lack of transparency and tendency to minimize the significance of these events are concerning signs.\n\nBefore making any decisions, I recommend taking some time to reflect on your feelings and priorities. Ask yourself:\n\n1. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? Is honesty and transparency essential to you?\n2. How do you feel about your partner's lack of openness and tendency to downplay significant events?\n3. Have you communicated your concerns and boundaries with your partner in the past? If not, is it time to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings?\n4. What are your expectations for your future together? Do you see a long-term future with this person, or are you holding on due to fear of the unknown or sunk cost fallacy?\n\nIt might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings, but only if you feel prepared to do so. Avoid accusatory or confrontational tone, and instead, focus on expressing your feelings and concerns.\n\nAs for confessing to looking at his messages, it's essential to be honest with your partner, but it's also important to consider the timing and approach. You might want to frame it as a way of understanding his past and his feelings, rather than an act of betrayal.\n\nUltimately, you need to decide what's best for you. If you feel that the relationship is no longer sustainable or healthy for you, it may be time to re-evaluate and consider ending it. However, if you're willing to work through these issues and have an open and honest conversation with your partner, it might be worth exploring the possibility of growth and change within the relationship.\n\nRemember, your feelings and priorities are valid, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being in this situation."

Instead of asking him to stop coming out when you leave your room, try framing the conversation around your needs and feelings. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I love spending time with you, and I value our hangouts.

You deserve to have your needs respected, and it's okay to advocate for yourself.\n\nLastly, consider setting some boundaries around your alone time and personal space. It's essential to prioritize your own well-being, even if it means setting limits with your roommate. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure to take care of yourself amidst this situation.\n\nI hope this helps you feel more empowered to address the issue.

Try to pause for a brief moment before speaking, and ask yourself, \"Is this really true?\" or \"Is this an exaggeration?\" This will help you catch yourself before the words leave your mouth.\n2. **Practice mindfulness**: Pay attention to your emotions when you're speaking. Are you getting excited or enthusiastic? That's normal! Just acknowledge those feelings and try to channel them into more authentic, accurate descriptions.\n3. **Use 'I' statements**: Instead of making sweeping statements, try using 'I' statements. For example, instead of \"I can't even go to hours without eating!\", say \"I get hungry quickly\" or \"I have a high metabolism.\" This helps to focus on your personal experiences and avoid generalizations.\n4. **Listen to feedback**: When people call you out on your exaggerations, take it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Acknowledge their concerns and try to understand their perspective. You might even ask them to help you improve your communication.\n5. **Practice storytelling with a friend**: Find a trusted friend or family member and have them listen to your stories. Ask them to gently point out when you're exaggerating, and work on adjusting your tone and language accordingly.\n6. **Read and write**: Writing can help you develop your critical thinking and self-editing skills. Try writing short stories or journal entries, and pay attention to how you describe events. This will help you develop a more nuanced sense of what's accurate and what's an exaggeration.\n\nRemember, changing habits takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up.

Just donating money won't do it. You have to get your hands dirty. The grittier your help can be, the better - volunteer at the prison, volunteer with NODA, hand out clean needles at the overnight free clinic, be an escort at PP, be a volunteer victim's advocate. Get IN IT. I'm not just talking about delivering flowers at the hospital. Do the tough jobs, face the ugly truths, see the humanity in the eyes of people who society has rejected. Your perspective will improve.",
    "base_reply": "Finding purpose and reigniting enthusiasm can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey! Here's a pro tip that's helped many people: focus on what's within your control, rather than trying to find a grand, all-encompassing purpose.\n\nInstead, identify small, incremental changes you can make to your daily habits, routines, and relationships that bring you a sense of fulfillment and joy. This could be as simple as:\n\n* Taking a 10-minute walk outside each morning to clear your mind\n* Starting a new hobby or creative pursuit, even if it's just 15 minutes a day\n* Setting aside dedicated time for self-care, whether that's reading, journaling, or practicing yoga\n* Reconnecting with a friend or family member you've been meaning to catch up with\n* Learning a new skill or taking an online course to challenge yourself\n\nThe key is to focus on these small, achievable steps rather than trying to find a grand, all-or-nothing purpose. By making these small changes, you'll start to build momentum and develop a sense of agency and control over your life.\n\nAs you make progress, you may find that your sense of purpose and enthusiasm start to grow. You might also discover that your interests and passions evolve over time, and that's okay! The important thing is to stay open to new experiences and be patient with yourself as you navigate this journey.\n\nRemember, it's not about finding a single, definitive purpose that defines your entire life. It's about finding small moments of joy, connection, and fulfillment that add up to a life well-lived."

    "base_reply": "Hey there! Sorry to hear that you're feeling shy all of a sudden. It's normal to go through ups and downs, and it's great that you're acknowledging it and seeking help.\n\nFirstly, it's important to understand that shyness is not a fixed trait, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a natural response to certain situations. The key is to work on building confidence and comfort in social situations.\n\nHere are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Identify the triggers**: Reflect on what's changed this year that might be contributing to your shyness. Is it a new school, new friends, or something else? Once you pinpoint the triggers, you can start working on strategies to overcome them.\n2. **Start small**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Begin with small, low-stakes interactions, like chatting with a friend or classmate about a shared interest. Gradually work your way up to more challenging conversations.\n3. **Practice active listening**: When you're in a conversation, focus on listening more than talking. Ask open-ended questions and show genuine interest in the other person. This can help you build connections and feel more comfortable.\n4. **Join a club or group**: Find a group that aligns with your interests, whether it's a sports team, book club, or volunteer group. This can be a great way to meet like-minded people and build relationships in a more relaxed setting.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and not be perfect. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to be outgoing or charismatic. Focus on being authentic and genuine, and people will likely respond positively.\n\nRegarding talking to girls, remember that it's not about trying to impress them or be someone you're not. Focus on building genuine connections and friendships with people who share your interests. And hey, if you do happen to develop a crush on someone, just be yourself and see where things go!\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. Building confidence and overcoming shyness takes time and effort. Be patient, stay consistent, and celebrate your small wins along the way.\n\nHope these tips help, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or concerns!"

    "sentence": "I have been married to my husband (M42) for 15 years. I think we’d both say that we have a solid marriage. But he’s not great at “filling my cup” (meeting my emotional needs) and over the years I’ve learned to get by on less and less. I do tell him specifically what I need. He says he can’t fill my cup unless his is full. But apparently his is never “full enough” to fill mine despite my  constant efforts to make him happy.\n\nWhenever we have a conversation about it (every few months) it’s initiated by me, saying “My cup is empty. I can’t do anymore.” He then just says his is empty too and “we both need to make an effort.” I tell him all the things I do to try to please him and he says something like “But when you quit your job to be a SAHM you said you’d make dinner every night and you don’t.” (I work part time now that our daughter is in school.) But if it isn’t making dinner it’s saving money or an unfinished house project or dishes left out. If I resolve one thing three more pop up. \n\nIf I leave something out and he asks me to put it away, I do so immediately. But that’s not good enough because he told me two days ago that “He shouldn’t have to ask”. \n\nI have ADHD so I don’t always notice things and I definitely can’t read minds. When I tell him “You DO need to ask me if you want something done bc I won’t know otherwise.” He doesn’t accept that answer because he thinks his expectations are “reasonable”. So I try harder but with this empty cup it’s like trying to push a car uphill. And now I’m perpetually anxious worrying that I haven’t met the unasked expectations. \n\nThere’s always an excuse not to fill my cup. My love language is words of affirmation. He said if he isn’t happy with what I’m doing he can’t “affirm” me but like, that’s when I need it. \n\nSo I don’t know. I just told him (after an argument) that I’m out of gas. I have nothing left. I’ve been crying for three days now and can barely function. I’ve told him so many times that its clear that I can’t be the person that he wants me to be so he should let me go! I deserve someone who loves me “as is” not as a work in progress. His constant criticism is killing me but HE says he’s been making a real effort to criticize me less so I guess *that* should fill my cup? 🙄\n\nI feel like an idiot even writing this. It sounds awful. And I think I need to call my dentist because I’ve been clenching my teeth from stress 24/7 and my jaw really fucking aches. Please give me some advice I can show him because isn’t listening to me.\n\nTL;DR: My husband refuses to “fill my cup” (meet my emotional needs) unless his is full but apparently his is never full despite my best efforts.",
    "human": "Well, it sounds like he's moving the goalposts because he doesn't actually want to change. And now you've caught on, so it's basically a matter of whether you can stand living another year, ten years, or lifetime with someone who doesn't want to respect your needs. \n\nIf you want to prove to yourself (not him, this is key) that this is unfair, start writing everything down, including his reasons for why he can't fulfill your needs that day. Give it a month. At the same time, see if there are any ADHD management skills you can use, like setting reminders for the big triggers he gets upset about. Like a 5 minute kitchen sweep to check that the dishes are put away, garbage is at a reasonable level, counters are clean. You know, basic considerate roommate shit.\n\nDon't forget to write down your needs, how you communicated them to him, and his response. But also if he goes out of his way to do something kind.\n\nYou're going to see very quickly whether this is a you problem or a him problem, and it's harder to ignore when it's written down -- whatever the result. \n\nI know how frustrating it is to have to manage a spouse with ADHD on every little thing around the house, so he might have some valid points there. But the fact that he brings up SAHM-ing when circumstances have CLEARLY changed, in response to you saying your emotional needs aren't met, says to me that your relationship is transactional and he is the sole arbiter of which transactions are valid.\n\nI was in a similar position to yours for years. It sucked the life out of me. My divorce has set me back financially and I may never get to have bio kids, but I no longer am arguing with someone about whether my needs can or even should be fulfilled. They should. And I now know myself well enough to know that I'm an OUTSTANDING (and human, so reasonably flawed) partner.

I'm here to offer you some honest advice, not to make you feel ashamed or guilty.\n\nFirstly, it's not awful to write this down. It's actually incredibly brave to acknowledge the struggles you're facing and seek help. Your husband's lack of emotional support and constant criticism are not your fault, and you don't deserve to be treated this way.\n\nRegarding your situation, it's clear that your husband is not taking your needs seriously and is instead expecting you to constantly accommodate his demands. His \"I can't fill your cup unless mine is full\" excuse is a classic example of emotional manipulation. It's not a healthy or sustainable way to maintain a relationship.\n\nHere are some points you can consider sharing with your husband:\n\n1. **Your emotional needs are not negotiable**: Just because you have ADHD doesn't mean you're excused from having emotional needs. Your husband needs to understand that your needs are not something he can simply \"fix\" or \"fill\" on his own schedule. You need to feel seen, heard, and validated regularly.\n2. **Criticism is not love**: His constant criticism is not a sign of love or effort. It's actually a form of emotional abuse. You deserve to be loved and respected, not belittled or criticized.\n3. **You can't pour from an empty cup**: You're right that you can't keep pouring your energy into your husband's needs without taking care of your own first. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take time for self-care.\n4. **Love languages are not a one-way street**: While his words of affirmation are important to you, it's not a one-way street. You need to feel heard and validated in return. His constant criticism is not meeting your emotional needs.\n5. **You deserve better**: You're right that you deserve someone who loves you \"as is,\" not as a work in progress. It's time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy and fulfilling for you.\n\nWhen sharing these points with your husband, try to avoid being confrontational or accusatory. Instead, focus on your own feelings and needs. Use \"I\" statements to express how his behavior is affecting you, and try to find common ground. Remember, you can't force your husband to change, but you can control how you respond to his behavior.\n\nLastly, please take care of yourself. It's essential to prioritize your mental and physical health during this challenging time. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these issues and develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember, you are not alone, and you deserve to be loved and respected."

It's a common struggle, and I'm happy to help you work on it.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's okay to not have a response ready immediately. It's normal to need a moment to process and reflect before responding. Practice taking a brief pause before speaking, even if it's just a split second. This can help you collect your thoughts and avoid blurting out unnecessary information.\n\nHere's a technique that might help:\n\n1. **Pause and breathe**: When your friend asks a question, take a deep breath, and pause for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds). This allows you to calm down and gather your thoughts.\n2. **Acknowledge and confirm**: Instead of immediately sharing your thoughts, respond with a simple acknowledgement, like \"Yeah, I know Kevin\" or \"Yes, I've met him.\" This shows you're engaged and acknowledges the question without committing to a lengthy response.\n3. **Use the 3-second rule**: Before sharing more information, count to 3 in your head (or out loud, if you need to!). This brief pause helps you think before speaking and ensures you're not blurting out unnecessary details.\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness exercises can help you develop greater self-awareness, making it easier to recognize when you're about to respond impulsively. Try incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine, such as through meditation, yoga, or simply paying attention to your breath.\n5. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of feeling pressured to respond quickly, reframe the conversation as an opportunity to engage thoughtfully. Remind yourself that it's okay to take a moment to collect your thoughts and respond with clarity and intention.\n6. **Set boundaries**: If you find yourself getting carried away with your responses, practice setting boundaries by politely interrupting yourself or saying \"Let me think about that for a moment.\" This helps you regain control and respond more thoughtfully.\n\nRemember, developing new habits takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With consistent effort, you'll become more mindful of your responses and learn to speak more thoughtfully."

It's not about being weak or incapable; it's about being human.

Experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you. You can even try some guided relaxation exercises online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n4. **Reframe your self-talk**: When you start to feel anxious, try to reframe your inner dialogue. Instead of telling yourself, \"I'm going to fail\" or \"I'm so stupid,\" remind yourself, \"I've prepared well, and I can do this.\" Focus on your strengths and past successes.\n5. **Take a few deep breaths before the test**: When you're sitting down to take the test, take a few slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.

Here are a few potential outcomes:\n\n1. **Denial of assistance**: The hospital or insurance provider may deny your application for financial assistance, citing that your household income is higher than the eligibility threshold. This means you'll be responsible for paying the full amount of the bill, which can be financially devastating.\n2. **Reduced assistance**: Even if you're not entirely denied, omitting your spouse's income might result in reduced financial assistance. This could lead to a smaller discount or a longer payment plan, which might still be challenging to manage.\n3. **Audit or investigation**: In some cases, the hospital or insurance provider might conduct an audit or investigation to verify your income. If they discover that you've misrepresented your income, it could lead to a denial of assistance or even legal action.\n4. **Damage to your credit**: Failing to disclose your spouse's income could be considered fraud or misrepresentation, which can negatively impact your credit score and reputation.\n5. **Strained relationships**: Hiding your spouse's income can create tension and mistrust in your relationship, especially if your partner is unaware of the omission.\n\nIt's essential to be honest and transparent about your financial situation, even if it's uncomfortable.

    "sentence": "TL;DR: I developed a crush on a coworker after she wouldn't stop leaning on me, and had a panic attack before asking her out. Got rejected, now she's cold with me, so I want to move on.\n\nBefore anybody says don't shit where you eat, I think I learned my lesson.\n\nSo, I developed a crush on my coworker after knowing her at work, and talking to her a lot, as she sits near me in the office.\n\nI started to develop a crush around Christmas time. I had been on friendly terms with both her and the rest of my colleagues before this, so me and my colleagues in my department, including her, all decided to have a drink after work on Christmas Eve. She decided to sit next to me when she didn't have to, and I had noticed that for almost the entire time we were sat down, she was heavyily pressing her body into mine, which I thought was both weird and kinda cute.\n\nAs I've talked to her more at work, she's grown on me. She's pretty, intelligent, witty, smart, and confident.\n\nI also noticed certain behaviors that she did mostly when talking to me. No overt flirting, but more things like subtle things like lip biting, lip licking, holding eye contact with me longer than usual, especially in group conversations, feet point towards me when talking to both me and other people, hair flicking and twirling, head tilting, blushing bright red, etc. I think if she hadn't shown any of these, I wouldn't have asked her out.\n\nSo last week I decided to ask her out. Now I was diagnosed with anxiety during the pandemic and found the entire thing of asking her out extremely stressful. Not because of her saying no, but because I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable coming into work. I ended up going into fight or flight mode the entire day after saying I wanted to ask her something in private, which she noticed and definitely also made her anxious. It got so bad that for about two hours before I asked her out, I had a really bad panic attack, to the point where I nearly called an ambulance, which I haven't told her about, and I'm not going to, because I don't want to make her feel guilty or put any pressure on her.\n\nAfter the panic attack, I managed to finally ask her out. I basically texted her saying \"sorry for being weird. Please don't take this the wrong way. Basically, I'd like to get to know you a bit better over a drink, if you'd like. There's no pressure on this. I'm perfectly happy if you say no, you don't need a reason\" and then basically explained that I was anxious as I didn't want her to feel like she couldn't come into work if she did say no.\n\nShe basically explained that while she was flattered, she thought it was a bad idea, and that she only thinks of me as a friend from work, which I am perfectly fine with by the way.\n\nIt's been over a week since, but now when she comes into work, especially for the first few days after I asked her out, she's understandably been very cold with me. She kept checking out of group conversations when I'm involved until a couple of days ago and avoiding eye contact with me.\n\nI've not said anything to any of my colleagues except one guy, who I and said girl are both friends with, and who hasn't said anything to anyone else. I don't want anything to be said about it to her.\n\nI've also been trying to act as nothing happened at work and just giving her as much space as she needs. For example, I've been making sure to not share the same lunch hour with her, etc.\n\nI'm just wondering if I'm doing the right thing by giving her some space and letting her just start talking to me again at her own pace. It's just been on my mind a lot, obviously, and I'd like a second opinion. While I am open to her changing her mind, I've just focused on moving on at the moment. So What's the best way to move on?\n\nThanks,",

That takes a lot of courage.\n\nIt's understandable that you're feeling a bit lost after being rejected, especially given the emotional investment you had in asking her out. However, it's great that you're recognizing the importance of respecting her boundaries and giving her space.\n\nAs you're trying to move on, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Continue to maintain a professional relationship: Since you're still working together, it's essential to maintain a professional demeanor and not let your emotions get in the way of your work. Focus on being a good colleague and friend to the rest of your team.\n2. Don't overthink it: Try not to overanalyze the situation or dwell on what went wrong. It's okay to acknowledge your feelings, but don't beat yourself up over it. Remember that rejection is a normal part of life, and it doesn't define your worth.\n3. Focus on self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your well-being.\n4. Explore new connections: While it's natural to feel drawn to someone who rejected you, don't close yourself off to the possibility of forming connections with others. Keep an open mind and be open to new friendships or relationships.\n5. Communicate with your colleagues: While you've been keeping the situation quiet, it's essential to be honest with your colleagues about how you're feeling. They may be able to offer valuable advice or support. Just be mindful of your boundaries and ensure you're not gossiping or speaking negatively about your coworker.\n6. Practice gratitude: Focus on the things you're grateful for, including your friendship with your coworker and the lessons you learned from the experience. This can help shift your perspective and move you forward.\n\nRemember, moving on doesn't mean erasing the experience or the feelings you had. It means acknowledging them, learning from them, and choosing to focus on the present and future."

Last night we went over to a friend's house to meet their new baby! We took our 1-year-old with us. While I was holding the new baby my daughter was starting to crawl toward the fireplace. The fireplace was not on but does have a step that our daughter could hit her face on and I could see it happening. I told my husband \"watch watch she's going by the fireplace\". He didn't move and the fireplace was within reaching distance of where he was sitting. I repeated myself 3x. Shortly, he freaks out on me and raised his voice, \"She \\* ing fine, leave me the \\* alone. OMG\". I was so embarrassed because this was in front of our 2 friends and their 2 friends. Regardless in front of people, alone, in other's houses, or in our house he shouldn't be talking to me like this. I was really upset and embarrassed, the room got quiet.\n\nI immediately handed the new baby off to his mama and pulled my husband aside to ask what that was. He played the, he's not wrong game and I was nagging him. We didn't talk on the ride home. when we got home I put our baby to sleep and took a shower. When we were in bed he apologized to me and tried to cuddle me. I asked him to back off and to really understand that that was extremely inappropriate and that it was a major turn-off. I actually think if we weren't married or had a family together I would start distancing myself from him. I didn't like that embarrassment he made me feel. I didn't like his rage either. Now I am turned off by him. On top of it, I am the more affectionate one in our relationship. I feel regret for trying all these past times to be pushed away. I promised him last night that I'm not going to initiate any kind of affection anymore. He talks to me like that after I work a full-time job, cook and clean up, do bath time for our baby, tries to squeeze in some outdoor time for her, do laundry, housework, doctor appts, grocery shopping... etc. He's a great dad but I do the bulk of the work. him talking to me and making me feel that way makes me not want to do any of it ( except take care of my daughter ).

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt, embarrassed, and turned off by your husband's behavior.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that his reaction was unacceptable, regardless of his tiredness or any other circumstances. No one deserves to be spoken to in that manner, especially not in front of others.\n\nIt's also crucial to recognize that his behavior is not just about being a father, but about being a partner. The way he spoke to you is a reflection of his communication style and emotional intelligence. It's not okay for him to take out his frustration on you, especially when you're trying to ensure your daughter's safety.\n\nConsidering your feelings and the impact his behavior has had on you, it's reasonable to take some space and re-evaluate your relationship. You've already taken a step by deciding not to initiate affection, which is a boundary you need to prioritize.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Have an open conversation**: When you're both feeling calm, have a conversation about what happened. Use \"I\" statements to express how his behavior made you feel, and avoid blaming or accusing language. This will help him understand your perspective and take responsibility for his actions.\n2. **Set clear boundaries**: Make it clear that his behavior is not acceptable and that you won't tolerate being spoken to in that manner. Establish what you're comfortable with and what you're not.\n3. **Re-evaluate your role in the relationship**: Take some time to reflect on why you've been shouldering most of the responsibilities. Is this due to societal pressure, personal habits, or a lack of communication with your husband? It's essential to find a balance and work together as a team.\n4. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can provide you with emotional support and guidance. It's essential to have a safe space to process your feelings and gain clarity on your next steps.\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Prioritize your physical and emotional well-being. Make time for self-care, exercise, and activities that bring you joy.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness in your relationship.

Now that you're in this situation, let's focus on finding a way to make it work.\n\nTo start with, you're right that getting a passable wedding ring is a good first step. You can also consider having a fake spouse's name, just in case anyone asks. You can use a combination of your own first name and a fictional last name, or even a name that's similar to a friend or acquaintance.\n\nNow, about the Christmas parties, happy hours, and other office events that may involve spouses: here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Bring a plus-one: If you're invited to an event with a spouse, consider bringing a friend or acquaintance who can play the role of your partner. This way, you won't have to worry about coming up with a convincing story or faking a relationship.\n2. Attend with a coworker: If you're not comfortable bringing a plus-one, you can attend the event with a coworker who's also single or has a similar situation. This way, you can present yourselves as colleagues or friends rather than partners.\n3. Create a backstory: If you do need to bring a fake spouse, create a quick backstory about how you met, your interests, and your relationship. This will help you feel more confident and prepared for any questions that might arise.\n4. Be prepared for questions: Anticipate that someone might ask about your spouse's job, hobbies, or interests. Have some basic answers prepared, but don't overdo it. Remember, the goal is to blend in, not to create a convincing fiction.\n5. Keep it simple: Don't overcomplicate things. If someone asks about your spouse, just stick to the basics and avoid going into too much detail. You can say something like, \"We're still getting to know each other,\" or \"We're taking things slow.\"\n\nRemember, this is a temporary situation, and you can always be honest with your employer or colleagues once you've completed the two years. For now, focus on being professional, friendly, and respectful, and try to enjoy the benefits of your new job.\n\nLastly, take this as an opportunity to reflect on why you felt the need to lie in the first place. It's essential to be honest and authentic in your personal and professional life. Try to learn from this experience and move forward with integrity.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you navigate this situation. Good luck, and remember to stay calm and confident!"

What are your non-negotiables? What are your goals and aspirations? When you're clear on your values, you'll be better equipped to make decisions that align with them, even if others don't agree.\n2. **Practice self-reflection**: Regularly take time to introspect and examine your thoughts, feelings, and actions.

Seek out individuals who encourage and support you, rather than those who try to control or manipulate you.\n7. **Take time to think before reacting**: When someone makes a suggestion or gives their opinion, take a moment to process it before responding. This will help you avoid reacting impulsively and make more thoughtful, informed decisions.\n8. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused on your own thoughts and emotions, rather than getting caught up in others' opinions or expectations. Regular mindfulness practice can increase your self-awareness and help you make more intentional decisions.\n9. **Celebrate your uniqueness**: Embrace your individuality and celebrate what makes you different. When you're confident in your own identity, you'll be less influenced by others' opinions and more likely to make decisions that align with your values and goals.\n10. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you can't please everyone.

He does 50% of the chores (we both struggle with this), has a job, saves a lot of money, is family-and-goal oriented (we want kids, and he is working hard to get passive income so that he can afford to stay home with them when they're little).\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, his anxiety and depression really went off the rails, which was a combination of the pandemic and the fact that he took on great personal responsibility (bought a house, started a harder job, was struggling with family issues, etc.) I often find that he is a very motivating person who pushes me to achieve my financial goals. He is very money-focused, and I am a spendthrift, so he has helped change my attitude towards money to be healthier / less wasteful.\n\nWhen his anxiety started manifesting physically and we were spending *every* night working through his problems and stress, I insisted that he start individual counseling and couple's counseling. We've been in CC for two years and he has made so many improvements. He is on medication, is seeing his individual counselor, trying to handle his problems on his own. He'll never be perfect, which I know. For instance, this morning at 7am (I wake up at 8:30am) he woke me up panicked that the state office had rejected some administrative paperwork to clear up an issue where they said he owed $30. Which is tiring, but I feel like maybe I should be able to deal with an anxiety outburst everyone once in a while.\n\nHowever, I also just feel incredibly checked-out. I feel like I've got caregiver burnout mixed with the seven year itch, and it's making me constantly overthink the relationship. He wants to get married now, and I'm feeling terrified to commit. My therapist says I need to make a decision and that if I want to stay I need to be willing to put in the work to meet him half-way since he already has done the work and let go of the fear and resentment from the past. But every week I meet with her and I feel no closer to a decision. I've made pros and cons lists, made lists of expectations from the relationships. I've talked all of this through with the therapists and him, and he is rightfully very upset with me and feels like I have been wasting his time and he'll \"never be good enough.\" I just want him to stop coming to me with his problems entirely, which I know is not fair.\n\nOn top of that, I feel like his general tone with me is occasionally condescending, but he swears none of it is, so I'm also policing his language and tone constantly, which may be because I'm so sensitive and have let so much resentment build up?\n\nI feel like it's not him, it's me, at this point. I want to fix myself so that I'm not like this and I am also so exhausted and not wanting to put in any effort.\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend used to have a lot of problems but got help to fix them but I'm still unwilling to move forward",
    "human": "If you need to be cajoled or talked into marrying someone; then you're not marrying the right person.\nForget married life for a minute.\nImagine your life without him in it.\nHow does it improve? How does it get worse?\nWould you be happier or would you be devastated?\nA relationship should always be with someone who makes your life better.\nIf they make it more difficult or if you don't feel happier being around them; then you're probably in a bad relationship - and believing someone to be a great person isnt enough of a reason to get married to them. There needs to be more in the win column.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've shared a lot, and I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings. It's understandable that you're feeling burnt out and uncertain about your relationship.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's not uncommon for partners of individuals with mental health struggles to experience caregiver burnout. You've been supporting your boyfriend through his struggles, and that's admirable. However, it's essential to recognize that you can't pour from an empty cup. You need to prioritize your own self-care and well-being.\n\nRegarding your feelings about committing to marriage, it's normal to feel uncertain. Seven years is a significant amount of time, and you've had a lot to process. It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and concerns. However, it might be helpful to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on the things that are \"wrong\" with your boyfriend or the relationship, try to focus on what you appreciate about him and the positive aspects of your partnership.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that you can't change your boyfriend or expect him to change to suit your needs. He's made significant progress, and it's unfair to put that burden on him. You need to accept him for who he is, flaws and all, and work on your own personal growth.\n\nRegarding the condescending tone, it's possible that it's a genuine aspect of his personality, but it's also possible that it's a coping mechanism or a way to deal with his anxiety. It's essential to communicate openly with him about how his tone affects you and work together to find a solution.\n\nI want to encourage you to take a step back and focus on your own personal growth. It's not about fixing yourself to suit your boyfriend or the relationship; it's about becoming the best version of yourself. Take time to explore your interests, prioritize self-care, and focus on building your own identity outside of the relationship.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings, concerns, and needs. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed when you wake me up at 7 am, and I need some space to recharge. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?\"\n\nRemember, relationships are a two-way street. You can't control your boyfriend's behavior or emotions, but you can control how you respond to them. By focusing on your own personal growth and well-being, you'll be better equipped to navigate the challenges that come with being in a relationship."

    "sentence": "TL;DR - 34m partner angry that I 29f haven’t been able to get rid of my anxiety. Doesn’t want to hear his anger is actually contributing/making it worse. How to communicate to someone to help them understand without anger \n\n\nSo for a bit of background I have had really chronic anxiety ever since I was a kid. It is a big part of my life and I haven’t been able to control it effectively with therapy or anti depressants. Anti anxiety medication (aka benzos) work great but I don’t take them because they don’t fix the problem and you only become reliant on them. \n\nI’m extremely empathetic, so I think I justify a lot of my partners behaviour as I imagine it would be hard to be with someone like me and I feel guilty for it.\n\nFor context we’ve been together for nearly 4 years I’m a 29 yr old female and he is 34. We have a really great lifestyle lots of camping and fishing hiking etc. We make each other laugh a lot, proper belly laughing you know. I really value him, I think he’s really intelligent and he works really hard. He can fix almost anything and if he sees something that needs doing he does it. \n\nMy anxiety makes it hard for me to do simple things sometimes. But for the most part the way I deal with it is to just bear it. A lot of my day I have a sick feeling in my stomach, I’m shaky and jumpy. (He hates that I startle so easily) I’m a ball of nerves and it’s exhausting I feel like I never have energy. But I still go about my day as normal. I get up and make his lunch at 4am everyday because I want to. I do all the housework and cooking and shopping and I work part time. He works full time. There’s never really a problem with housework it works really well for us. And if I need help I just ask. I have good days and bad days, I keep myself fit and always make sure the house is clean and dinner is done for him to come home to. I think the biggest thing is how sad I am. I have alot of pain and he doesn’t understand it. I deal with it on my own and just being around him and spending time together when we can is enough for me to feel content\n\nThe problem is his anger. And I justify it because I’m sure it is frustrating to be with me. He doesn’t understand why I can’t get better and thinks it’s because I haven’t tried hard enough. He can be really cruel when he is angry. \nI don’t have any family and my friends are interstate since we’ve moved. He has made it clear that he does not want to be supportive (ie he doesn’t want to talk or comfort if I’m anxious or sad) which I have accepted as it makes sense that I have to be responsible for my own healing. (It does make me feel extremely alone) How he treats me because of my anxiety has been making me worse. I try to communicate this through talking but that never works he is immediately defensive and angry no matter how calmly I try to bring an issue up. He says I can choose how I feel, but I don’t know how to not be hurt by the things he says.\nToday I went Christmas shopping I had anxiety but I still went as I still do everything with anxiety so no big deal. Sometimes it turns into a full blown panic attack. This happened today in the shops, racing heart, dizzy and the scariest thing that happens to me is my hands cramp up like they’re closed and I can’t open them. These happen with little to no warning other than prior anxiety which I usually have so I can’t tell the difference. The store person wanted to call the ambulance which I’m just so embarrassed at this point and it’s happened before so I know now I’m not having a stroke or seizure they are a little less scary.. I leave and I force myself back to my car until I am calm enough to drive, after a long cry and just feeling awful I go home and get on with my day, I do the grocery shopping at another store a little over an hour later and I’m okay. I didn’t even bother to let him know what happened at the time. But I did mention it over dinner that I had a bad one today (it’s been a long time since the last one that was that extreme) and he just looked at me and said “fuck you’re useless” “what sort of adult can’t even handle going to the shops”\nHe looked at me disgusted and he got up from the table and spat at me as he walked past. \nHis reaction surprised me, we had been having a pleasant evening. I hadn’t expected it to be so extreme so quickly. Sometimes he will just acknowledge it and we move onto the next subject but I feel better just that he knows.\nThey’re have been countless times where he has said many cruel horrible things and names. I’m left in silent tears, it crushes me when all I want is to be asked if I’m okay or given a hug. I feel really really alone. When he is really nasty it’s like my heart is psychically hurting/breaking. Rarely ever will he apologise\n\nBut I understand that he must be disappointed (no one is more disappointed in me than myself)\nI rarely confide in him as he doesn’t want me to. But how can I get him to understand that he’s actually hurting me and making it worse without him getting angry and telling me I’m just blaming (I promise I’m really not doing that I always acknowledge my part and I will start by addressing me before him so I don’t make him feel attacked)\n\nWhen I am good (even if I am just hiding it) we are so good. But when I am struggling it is bad\n\nIs it even possible to get someone to understand your in pain and struggling? I get the whole pick yourself up don’t dwell on it attitude and I feel like I do get on with it regardless. But it doesn’t stop the pain or anxiety from being there and bubbling over when I’m not strong enough and I just feel like I’m being punished for that even though I believe I’m doing okay (I know you can always do better) I just wish I could let him feel what I feel for a moment and maybe he wouldn’t be so cruel and hurtful when I am experiencing it",
    "human": "He spat at you... he SPAT at you??? \n\nRead that however many times you need to read it to realise how abnormal and abusive that is. \nALL of his reactions to your anxiety are wrong and abusive, but HE SPAT AT YOU. \n\nThat is not love and he does not respect you. \n\nI promise you that it's possible to have an understanding partner who cares about your feelings; my partner has cried for me at times when I've been telling him about past traumas.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's incredibly tough to navigate a relationship when you're struggling with anxiety and your partner isn't supportive. I'm here to help you explore ways to communicate with your partner in a way that might help him understand your struggles better.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with anxiety, and it's not something you can simply \"snap out of\" or \"get over.\" It's a legitimate condition that requires understanding and empathy.\n\nBefore approaching the conversation with your partner, take some time to reflect on what you want to achieve. What do you hope to get out of this conversation? What do you want him to understand about your anxiety? What specific behaviors or words are causing you pain?\n\nWhen you do talk to him, try to approach the conversation without blaming or accusing language. Instead, focus on how his words and actions make you feel. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and experiences. For example:\n\n\"I feel really hurt when you say things like 'you're useless.' It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, and it's hard for me to shake off that feeling. I wish you could understand that anxiety is not something I can control, and it's not about being weak or lazy.\"\n\nAvoid getting defensive or emotional, as this can escalate the situation. Instead, maintain a calm tone and focus on the impact his words have on you.\n\nIt's also essential to set boundaries and communicate what you need from him. Let him know that you need his support and understanding when you're struggling. You might say something like:\n\n\"When I'm having a bad day, I need you to be patient and understanding. I need you to listen to me without judgment and offer words of comfort. I know you might not understand what I'm going through, but I need you to try.\"\n\nRemember that you can't change how your partner feels or reacts, but you can control how you respond to him. By communicating your needs and feelings in a clear and respectful manner, you might be able to create a more empathetic and supportive environment.\n\nLastly, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you develop coping strategies and provide you with a safe space to talk about your feelings. Remember, you deserve to be heard and understood, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being in this situation."

    "sentence": "how to handle my difficult boss TLDR at bottom. \n\nI started a job as a server about 6 months ago and everything about the job was wonderful up until around mid January. I make decent money and I get along with all of my co-workers but my boss has made my job very difficult and I dread coming to work now. I’m already looking for a job closer to the career I’m wanting (nursing) and putting in applications for hospitals and all but until then I need help figuring out how to ease the tension. \n\nI’ve have multiple co-workers coming to me with things he’s said to them about me. For starters I have hypothyroidism and I have to take medication every morning an hour before I eat and I open a lot at work and so every now and then I’ll end up taking my pill at work if I didn’t have time before. My boss has seen this and I explained the situation to him because he gave me an odd look. He’s been going around telling the entire staff that “what ever pills she’s taking she needs to stop because they’re making her stupid and it’s stupid that she takes them” he has also come to me telling me to quit taking my medication or he will have to cut my hours. \n\nAnother situation is my tables. For some insight he stops by tables a lot and talks to them for a bit for all of the servers and will occasionally up-sell for them but still let them handle everything. When I first started I needed some extra help serving tables because I was being trained in three different positions around the restaurant at the same time and wasn’t being scheduled at all as a server except 1-2 half shifts every other week and I only ever shadowed people for the first 3 weeks. I can handle several tables at a time now and everyone I wait on hasn’t had any complaints to me so far. They always thank me saying they enjoyed talking with me and hope they have me next time. My boss does not acknowledge this and has started to skip me multiple times in a row if he deems I’m too busy for another table. This is happening when I only have two tables and it’s slow. He also has a bad habit of seating me without saying it’s my table while I’m in the kitchen putting up dishes, taking their order immediately after seating them, and legitimately yelling at me for it saying this is why he is skipping me and that it proves I can’t handle more than two tables at a time. He will also stop by my tables while I’m getting the drinks and then rush off without telling me anything and put the order in under the manager number and won’t let me access it. If I ask him to transfer it to my number so I can put in their order he yells at me before he transfers it. \n\nI converted to Islam a little over a year ago and so I can only eat halal meat and no pork and it’s almost every other day that he belittles me for it and makes fun of me saying I need a drink and that the meat they have is “not good enough for the Princess”.\n\nOne of the three jobs I was trained to do is food runner. I’ve been training the new girl the past week and I’m working as food runner more often because we’re down two people and I’m the only other person that is trained as food runner and he will come in every single time regardless of if it’s busy or not screaming at me to the point that customers and the other staff can hear. One night in particular we got a little while I was working with the new girl and we had one mess up order because she mistook an order and made the wrong thing so we put it to the side until it slowed down. My boss came into the kitchen and picked up the tongs we use for the oven and threw them into the salad bad while he was screaming and then threw out everything we were currently working on saying I’m giving him extra work. Afterwards he went t another server and told them he wanted to fire me because of all the extra work he has to do for me. \n\nI need help figuring out how to talk to him about this because any time I try to bring it up he throws a fit and walks off while I’m talking. \n\nTLDR; I’m a server at a restaurant and my boss says the medication I am taking for my hypothyroidism makes me stupid and tells me to quit taking it or he will cut my hours, interrupts my working to yell and scream and then screams more when I fall behind trying to clean up after him, and consistently belittles me for my religion.",

Here's a step-by-step plan to help you address the issues:\n\n1. **Document everything**: Keep a record of all incidents, including dates, times, and details of what happened. This will help you track patterns and provide evidence if needed.\n2. **Prepare for a calm conversation**: Schedule a meeting with your boss when he's not busy or stressed. Approach the conversation calmly and clearly state your concerns, using \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example:\n\t* \"I feel uncomfortable when you make fun of my medication. I understand it might not be something you're familiar with, but I'd appreciate it if you could respect my medical needs.\"\n\t* \"I feel frustrated when you interrupt me while I'm working and then yell at me when I fall behind. I'm trying my best to manage my tables, and your interruptions make it difficult.\"\n\t* \"I feel disrespected when you belittle my religion. I'd appreciate it if you could refrain from making comments about my dietary restrictions.\"\n3. **Focus on the impact**: Instead of attacking your boss's behavior, focus on the impact it has on your work and well-being. For example:\n\t* \"When you skip me for tables, it makes me feel undervalued and unsure of my abilities. I'd like to discuss a plan for assigning tables more fairly.\"\n\t* \"When you yell at me in front of customers, it makes me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. I'd appreciate it if we could find a more constructive way to address issues.\"\n4. **Set boundaries**: Clearly communicate your limits and what you're willing to tolerate. For example:\n\t* \"I understand that mistakes happen, but I'd appreciate it if you could refrain from yelling at me in front of customers. Instead, let's discuss the issue privately.\"\n\t* \"I'm not comfortable with you making fun of my medication. I'd appreciate it if you could respect my medical needs and not make comments about them.\"\n5. **Be prepared for resistance**: Your boss might not respond positively to your concerns. Be prepared to reiterate your points calmly and professionally. If the behavior continues, it may be necessary to escalate the issue to HR or a higher manager.\n6. **Start job hunting**: As you mentioned, you're already looking for a new job. Keep applying and don't hesitate to take a new opportunity if it arises. Your well-being is important, and you deserve a workplace that respects and values you.\n\nRemember, you don't have to tolerate abusive behavior from your boss.

My job's drug plan covers only me.\n\nThree brothers has severe nodular acne that's painful and caused permanent scars. To avoid more permanent scarring, their family doctor and dermatologist recommended an immediate dose of Epuris, but it's expensive and will only exacerbate the financial burden, already on huge, on me. For the first month, their dermatologist will start them on 40 mg ($80 USD at our local Costco), but they'll need 120 mg (30 mg x 3 costs $70 x 3). BTW, the division of (30 x 3) is a shade cheaper than (40 x 2) + 20. \n\nThus the total cost after tax will be $2500/person for 1 month of 40 mg and 11 months of 120 mg.

Here's a piece of advice: don't put too much pressure on yourself to make friends right away. It takes time, and it's okay to take things slow.\n\nFirst, focus on getting settled into your new routine and getting comfortable in your new environment. Take some time to explore your new surroundings, get familiar with your school, and find your favorite spots.\n\nAt school, try to sit with different people at lunch or join a club or activity that interests you. This will give you a chance to meet new people with similar interests. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with someone new – just be yourself, and be genuine. Ask them about themselves, their interests, or their favorite hobbies.\n\nAnother thing you can try is to attend school events or gatherings, like sports games, concerts, or cultural festivals. These events can be a great way to meet new people who share similar interests.\n\nIt's also important to remember that making friends takes time and effort from both sides. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep being your awesome self, and eventually, you'll find people who share your values and interests.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of small talk! Smile, introduce yourself, and be friendly to everyone you meet. You never know who might become a future friend or acquaintance.\n\nRemember, making friends is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Just be patient, stay positive, and keep putting yourself out there. Good luck!"

Set the weight down. Set the ton of bricks down and walk away. You don't need it and it's no longer useful. Feel the weight off your back. Feel how light your shoulders feel.

Getting over a first love can be especially challenging because it's often tied to a significant portion of your life, memories, and identity.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to take time to heal. Seven months is a decent amount of time, but it's not uncommon for the pain to linger. Instead of putting a timeline on your grief, focus on allowing yourself to feel the emotions as they come.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on the pain of the breakup, try to acknowledge the lessons you learned from the relationship. What did you gain from it? What did you learn about yourself? What would you do differently in the future?\n\nIt's also essential to focus on self-care. Take care of your physical and emotional well-being by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating nutritious food. Engage in activities that bring you joy, whether it's reading, painting, or spending time with friends and family.\n\nRemember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take your time. Don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over it\" or \"move on\" by a certain time. Allow yourself to feel the emotions, and know that with time, the pain will become less intense.\n\nLastly, consider seeking support from loved ones, a therapist, or a support group. Sharing your feelings with others who understand can be incredibly helpful in the healing process.\n\nRemember, healing is a journey, and it's unique to each person. Be patient with yourself, and know that you'll get through this."

From the start i knew things were fishy as he’d never facetime or send recent pictures of himself to my mom. I don’t know how or when but he’s now claiming to be a doctor/lieutenant in a super secret part of the marines and is allegedly being held captive in Afghanistan by the taliban at this very moment. She’s talked through him almost entirely through text and has been sending him money at his request in order to “pay for his safety.” I don’t know any more specifics since she’s stopped talking about him to me when i first suggested he was a catfish. \n\nLast night she accidentally sent me a text she’d intended to send to him discussing a deposit of $500 dollars into a wells fargo account.

Avoid bringing it up in public or when your mom is busy.\n2. **Start with empathy and concern**: Begin by expressing your concern for your mom's feelings and well-being. Let her know that you're worried about her happiness and safety. Acknowledge that you understand she might be upset, but you want to help her see the situation more clearly.\n3. **Focus on the facts, not accusations**: Avoid blaming or attacking language. Instead, present the evidence you've collected in a non-confrontational manner. Share the screenshots, emails, and research you've done, and explain why you think it's important to be cautious. Use \"I\" statements to describe your feelings and concerns.\n4. **Listen to her perspective**: Give your mom space to share her thoughts and feelings. Listen actively and try to understand why she might be drawn to this person. Avoid being judgmental or critical.\n5. **Encourage her to take a step back**: Suggest that she take some time to re-evaluate the situation and consider the potential risks involved. Encourage her to prioritize her own safety and well-being.\n6. **Offer support and help**: Let your mom know that you're there to support her, and that you're willing to help her get out of the situation if she wants to. You could offer to help her block his numbers, change her passwords, or even report him to the authorities.\n7. **Set boundaries**: If your mom is unwilling to listen or take action, it's essential to set boundaries to protect yourself. Let her know that you won't engage in conversations about this topic or help her with his requests for money.\n\nExample script to get you started:\n\n\"Mom, I want to talk to you about Eric. I know you're upset, and I'm worried about your feelings. I understand you might feel hurt or embarrassed, but I want to help you see that this situation might not be what it seems. I've been doing some research, and I've found some concerning information. I'm worried about your safety and well-being. Can we talk about this and look at the evidence together? I want to support you and help you make the best decision for yourself.\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, empathetic, and non-judgmental throughout the conversation. It's possible that your mom might not be ready to listen or accept the truth, but by approaching the conversation with kindness and concern, you're showing her that you care about her well-being and are there to support her."

Are you heavy data users, or do you mostly use your phones for calls and texts? Do you have any specific features in mind, like international roaming or streaming capabilities?\n\nNext, make a list of your priorities. Are you looking for the cheapest option, or are you willing to pay a bit more for better coverage and customer service? Are there any specific carriers you're interested in or have heard good things about?\n\nNow, let's talk about the fine print. Be wary of \"unlimited\" plans that come with asterisks and caveats. Some carriers might throttle your speeds or limit your data usage after a certain amount of usage. Make sure you understand what you're getting into.\n\nHere's a general tip: consider looking into smaller carriers or MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators). They often offer competitive pricing and similar coverage to the bigger carriers, but with fewer hidden fees and more flexible plans.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that you don't need to sign a contract. Most carriers offer month-to-month plans, which can give you more flexibility if your needs change.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to ask questions. Carriers are often willing to negotiate or offer discounts for new customers. And don't be afraid to walk away if you don't like the deal you're being offered.\n\nSome specific carriers to consider might be:\n\n* T-Mobile: Known for their affordable plans and competitive pricing.\n* Cricket Wireless: A budget-friendly option with a focus on prepaid plans.\n* Google Fi: A great option for those who want a simple, no-contract plan with decent coverage.\n* Visible: A relatively new carrier that offers affordable, no-contract plans with Verizon's network.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution.

As a kid we had a close family friend who I’d spend many nights at his house and he at mine. On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she’d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She’d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She’d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she’d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn’t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn’t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don’t really have ties to the faith anymore.

It's essential to acknowledge that you didn't deserve what happened to you, and it's not your fault.\n\nRegarding your concerns about exploring your sexuality, it's completely understandable given your past experiences. Trust issues are a natural result of trauma, and it's crucial to prioritize your emotional well-being. I want to emphasize that there are no rush or expectations to explore your sexuality.

    "base_reply": "The pesky small tasks that can be overwhelming despite being, well, small! I totally get it. It's great that you're acknowledging this pattern and wanting to break it. Here are some tips to help you tackle those tiny tasks:\n\n1. **Break it down into even smaller chunks**: When a task feels daunting, it's natural to put it off. Try breaking it down into teeny-tiny tasks. For example, if you need to send a university application, break it down into: \"Write a draft,\" \"Edit the draft,\" \"Proofread,\" and \"Submit.\" Each step is manageable and less overwhelming.\n2. **Use the 2-minute rule**: If a task takes less than 2 minutes to complete, do it immediately. This rule helps you build momentum and gets those small tasks out of the way quickly. You can also set a timer for 2 minutes and challenge yourself to complete the task within that time frame.\n3. **Create a \"Stop Doing\" list**: Identify tasks that are causing you to procrastinate and write them down on a \"Stop Doing\" list. This helps you acknowledge the tasks and make a conscious decision to stop putting them off. Review the list regularly to stay accountable.\n4. **Make a \"Micro-Task\" schedule**: Set specific times each day or week to dedicate to completing small tasks. This could be 10-15 minutes in the morning or evening. Having a scheduled time for these tasks helps you prioritize and make progress.\n5. **Remove distractions**: Identify the environments or situations that make you procrastinate and remove them. For example, if you know you can't focus on a task at home, try doing it at a library or coffee shop.\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate each time you complete a small task. This helps build motivation and reinforces the behavior.\n7. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel nervous or overwhelmed. Acknowledge these feelings, and then gently refocus on the task at hand.\n8. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you complete a set of small tasks. This can be something as simple as taking a short break, going for a walk, or enjoying a favorite snack.\n\nRemember, breaking the habit of procrastination takes time and practice. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With consistent effort, you'll develop new habits that help you tackle those small tasks with ease."

It's not okay for someone to lash out at you in that way, even if they're frustrated.\n\nRegarding whether this is a red flag, I'd say it's definitely a concern. When someone gets that angry over a minor mistake, it can be a sign of deeper issues. It's possible that he has unexpressed anger or frustration that's been building up, and your mistake was just the trigger.\n\nAs you mentioned, you're a responsible driver with years of experience, and it's not like you're intentionally trying to cause problems. It's reasonable to assume that he should be understanding and patient with you, especially since you're going out of your way to drive him around.\n\nThe fact that he's expressed frustration about your missing turns before and then reacted so strongly when it happened again suggests that this might be a pattern. It's possible that he's not just frustrated with you, but also with the situation in general, which could be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nIt's also worth considering that he slammed off your car radio, which could be a sign of disrespect or a power play. When someone takes control of your personal space or belongings in a way that feels aggressive or invasive, it's a red flag.\n\nI would encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with him about how his reaction made you feel. Try to use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing him. You could say something like, \"Hey, when you slammed off the radio, I felt really scared and hurt. It felt like you were taking control of my space and dismissing my feelings. Can we talk about what was going on for you in that moment?\"\n\nListen to his response and pay attention to how he reacts. If he's defensive or dismissive, it might be a sign that he's not willing to work on his communication style or acknowledge his own emotions. If he's willing to listen and apologize, it could be a sign that he's willing to work on the issue.\n\nRemember, relationships involve growth and compromise. If you feel like you're consistently walking on eggshells around him or feeling belittled, it might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is healthy for you."

    "base_reply": "Getting affordable medical care in the US can be a challenge, but there are ways to reduce the financial burden. Here are some strategies to help you get medical care without breaking the bank:\n\n1. **Health Insurance**: Having a good health insurance plan is crucial. Research and compare plans to find one that fits your budget. You can get insurance through your employer, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace, or a private insurer. Make sure to choose a plan with a reasonable deductible, copays, and coinsurance.\n2. **Network providers**: Check if your insurance plan has a network of providers. Sticking to in-network providers can significantly reduce costs. You can also ask your doctor if they're part of a larger medical group or network to get better rates.\n3. **Community Health Centers (CHCs)**: Community Health Centers provide affordable primary care services, including check-ups, vaccinations, and chronic disease management. They're often funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and may offer sliding-scale fees based on income.\n4. **Discount programs**: Look for programs like Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) or manufacturer copay cards, which can reduce medication costs. You can also ask your doctor or pharmacist about discounts or generic alternatives.\n5. **Sliding-scale fees**: Some medical facilities, like clinics or non-profit hospitals, offer sliding-scale fees based on income. They may also have programs for low-income individuals or those with financial difficulties.\n6. **Negotiate with providers**: If you're facing high bills, try negotiating with your provider. They may be willing to work with you to reduce the cost or set up a payment plan.\n7. **Charity care**: If you're uninsured or underinsured, some hospitals offer charity care programs. These programs can reduce or waive medical bills based on your income and financial situation.\n8. **Free or low-cost services**: Many organizations, like the National Health Service Corps, offer free or low-cost health services, including mental health support, nutrition counseling, and health education.\n9. **Medicaid and Medicare**: If you're eligible, Medicaid or Medicare can provide comprehensive coverage for medical services. You can check eligibility and apply online or through your state's Medicaid office.\n10. **Advocate for yourself**: Don't be afraid to ask questions and advocate for yourself. Research your options, and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or appeal a high bill if necessary.\n\nRemember, getting affordable medical care requires patience, persistence, and research. By exploring these options, you can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses and receive the medical care you need."

Acknowledge to yourself that it's okay if you're not immediately taken by the pet's charm. Remember, it's not about you; it's about respecting their connection with their pet.\n\nWhen you arrive, try to show genuine interest and politeness towards the pet. You can do this by:\n\n1. Making a brief comment about the pet's appearance or a funny thing they did. This shows you're making an effort to engage, even if you're not entirely enthralled.\n2. Asking your host about the pet's habits, training, or any funny stories they have. This demonstrates you care about their experiences and are willing to learn more.\n3. Avoiding negative comments or criticism about the pet. Even if you're not a fan, try not to make disparaging remarks or jokes.\n\nHowever, if you're really struggling to connect with the pet or feel overwhelmed, it's okay to politely excuse yourself for a bit. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm going to step outside for some fresh air/ grab a drink/get some more comfortable. I love spending time with you, but I'm not really feeling the pet vibes today.\"\n\nThis approach shows you're not trying to avoid the pet entirely, but rather taking a break to recharge and prioritize your own comfort. When you return, you can continue engaging with your host and other topics.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries. If you're consistently feeling anxious or stressed around pets, it might be worth having an open conversation with your friends or family about your concerns.

This helps you regain a sense of control and momentum.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This might mean taking a walk, practicing yoga, or reading a book. When you're taking care of yourself, you'll be better equipped to handle life's challenges and stay focused on your goals.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself when you do get sidetracked. Acknowledge the setback, learn from it, and gently refocus on your goals. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint!"

    "sentence": "I [23F] have been with my boyfriend [27M] for almost 3 years, now. Our relationship has never been easy, but not for the reasons that most couples can relate to. My boyfriend has a very serious chronic illness that he was diagnosed with just as we met each other. We love each other very much and always have since the very beginning. We make each other laugh and we have compatible views on almost everything— except for the topic of marriage. \n\nSince the very first day we knew each other (I was only 20 years old, in college, and he was in the beginning of his career), I have physically and emotionally taken care of my boyfriend because his serious chronic illness goes through periods of being much more severe and he cannot adequately care for himself during those times. He is very kind to me and has always done his best to support us financially. We moved in together very quickly so I could be there for him whenever he needed help. We fell deeply in love with each other as the years went by and decided that we wanted to stay together as long as possible. \n\nWhen I graduated college, it was right as the pandemic started and, in a very traumatic turn of events, a day or so later, my boyfriend suddenly ended up in the hospital due to his illness. He was extremely sick because he couldn’t get his usual medicine on time due to pandemic-related hospital issues. This whole situation completely broke me since I really thought he was going to die. When I faced the (very real) possibility of losing him, I realized just how much he meant to me and how little everything else mattered. Honestly, I haven’t really been the same since all of that happened. Thankfully, he survived and I have been something of a stay-at-home-girlfriend for the past year and a half to try to prevent anything like that from happening again. In the time since, we have adopted an emotional support cat (who we both love very much) and, after taking very good care of his physical well-being, my boyfriend has become healthy enough that I was able to recently go out and get a job of my own. He has been supportive, kind to me, and thankful for my help the entire time. \n\nDuring all of the hardships we faced together, I began fantasizing about what it would be like to get married to this wonderful man and be his wife. The idea brought me a lot of comfort and I slowly began to realize how much I loved the idea. However, I now face a huge problem: my boyfriend doesn’t believe in marriage. When we first started dating, back when I was barely 21 years old, he made it very clear to me that he did not want to ever have children (due to the fact that his illness would make him an absent father) and that he never would want to marry. At first, I had absolutely no problem with this because I was younger and wasn’t even thinking about that kind of stuff yet, but now, I’m not sure if I feel the same way anymore. \n\nThree weeks ago, I brought this up to him. It did not go well. He got extremely defensive, frustrated, and upset. It was our first major fight, ever. He showed me a side of him that I have never seen before. I cried a lot. Although I completely understand and agree with his feelings on not wanting to have children (he even took responsibility and got a vasectomy as soon as he was physically healthy enough), I might want to get married one day, which isn’t what he wanted to hear. He grew up in an abusive household and marriage scares him as a result. I feel terrible because I’d NEVER want to pressure him in any way, especially not with something like this. The conversation between him and I went horribly and brought him a lot of stress, which ultimately triggered a flare-up of his illness. I feel so bad for even discussing marriage with him…\n\nNow that his latest flare-up is under control, I’m terrified of bringing the conversation up with him ever again. I don’t know what I should do. I love him so much that I guess I could learn to give up my fantasy of marriage if it causes him so much stress, but I feel really hurt. Our life together is so special and each moment I have with him means so much to me, so I feel guilty for having thoughts of wanting anything more. \n\nAny advice on what I should do? I’m not sure who or where to turn to. Should I give up on the idea of marriage? Am I being ridiculous for feeling hurt, considering the circumstances? \n\nTL;DR: my chronically-ill boyfriend, who I have been physically and emotionally caring for (over a period of almost 3 years), doesn’t believe in marriage and I’m starting to question if I feel the same way.\n\n\n**EDIT: I just woke up this morning to everyone’s incredibly thoughtful, insightful, very well-articulated comments and suggestions. I just want to say how thankful I am to have had so many people reach out to me with their thoughts and suggestions. I am now in the process of reading each and every comment, which is going to take a while, but I sincerely appreciate all of the help here. The second thing I’d like to say is that late last night my boyfriend actually found this post while he was on Reddit and it started a very long conversation. No tears, no frustration, just a very honest discussion. I think he now realizes how much this has been eating me up inside and, more importantly, why marriage is an important thing for us to consider/talk about together, even if we don’t do it. Plus, he saw how many of you suggested he consider going to speak to a professional about his childhood trauma and I think it was something that he needed to hear (from someone other than me for once). \nI also would like to add, since there seems to be a bit of confusion here, he has never discouraged me from working or anything like that. It just kind of ended up this way in the aftermath of his hospitalization and the pandemic. I did apply for work during that time, but was having trouble landing a job due to everything that was going on back in late 2020 to 2021. Thankfully, now, I have my first good job and my boyfriend is very proud of me for getting it. As a lot of you have pointed out to me, my boyfriend and I have a lot to talk about now. Thank you all so much again!",
    "human": "You’re not ridiculous for being hurt. It’s perfectly normal to have those types of thoughts three years in. I think it would be useful to think about the types of protections that marriage gives you, esp when dealing with illnesses. As his girlfriend, you have zero rights or ability to advocate for him in a hospital, for example.\n\nHowever, other posters are right and it sounds like he is suffering the effects of trauma and could use some therapy.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, what a complex and sensitive situation you're facing! I'm glad to hear that your boyfriend found your post and had a thoughtful conversation with you about it. It's clear that you both have a deep emotional connection and are committed to each other's well-being.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to have feelings of hurt and frustration when your partner's values and beliefs differ from yours. It's natural to want to share your desires and dreams with the person you love, and it's understandable that you feel like you're being asked to give up a part of yourself.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider your boyfriend's past trauma and the impact it has on his views on marriage. It's not about being \"ridiculous\" to feel hurt, but rather about acknowledging the complexity of his feelings and the potential triggers that come with discussing marriage.\n\nGiven the progress you've made in your conversation, it seems like your boyfriend is willing to have a more open and honest discussion about his feelings. I would suggest continuing this conversation, but in a way that prioritizes empathy and understanding. Ask him to share more about his experiences and how they've shaped his views on marriage. Listen actively and try to understand where he's coming from, even if you don't agree with his perspective.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your feelings and desires are valid, and it's okay to express them to your partner. You can say something like, \"I understand that you have concerns about marriage, but I want to share with you why it's important to me. I feel like it would be a way for us to solidify our commitment to each other and make a long-term plan for our future together.\"\n\nRemember that compromise is often a part of any successful relationship. You might not get exactly what you want, but you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you. Perhaps you could explore alternative ways to celebrate your commitment to each other, such as a ceremony or a symbolic ritual that feels meaningful to both of you.\n\nLastly, it's great that your boyfriend is willing to consider seeking professional help to address his childhood trauma. That's a huge step, and it could potentially help him work through his feelings about marriage and other aspects of your relationship.\n\nRemember to prioritize open communication, empathy, and understanding in your conversation. It's okay to have different opinions and values, but it's crucial to approach these differences with compassion and respect."

Since you're 19 and not quite old enough to frequent bars, let's focus on other ways to meet people. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start with your work colleagues**: Even though you mentioned they're older, try to get to know them better. Ask questions about their interests, hobbies, or families. You might find common ground or a shared passion that can spark a connection.\n2. **Explore local community events**: Look for events in your town that aren't specifically focused on drinking or nightlife. This could be farmers' markets, outdoor concerts, or town festivals. These events can be a great way to meet people who share similar interests.\n3. **Join online groups or forums**: Search for local Facebook groups or online forums focused on topics you're interested in, such as hiking, gaming, or music. This can help you connect with like-minded people before meeting in person.\n4. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, language course, or art workshop. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also meet people with similar interests.\n5. **Get involved in your community**: Look for opportunities to help out at local organizations, such as animal shelters, libraries, or food banks. Volunteering is a great way to meet people while doing something good for your community.\n6. **Meetup.com**: Search for Meetup groups in your area that align with your interests. This platform allows you to attend events and meet people who share similar passions.\n7. **Be patient and persistent**: Making friends takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep attending events, joining groups, and reaching out to people until you find your tribe.\n8. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key when building relationships. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere.\n9. **Follow up and follow through**: If you hit it off with someone, make sure to follow up and stay in touch. Suggest getting together for coffee or another activity to continue building your connection.\n10. **Be open-minded**: Be willing to step out of your comfort zone and try new things. You never know who you might meet or what opportunities might arise.\n\nRemember, making friends takes time and effort, but it's worth it. Focus on building genuine connections and being a good friend, and you'll increase your chances of forming meaningful relationships in your new town."

She has a coworker [M26] she admitted to having a crush on. It's been around 6 months now since she had the crush. While a bit uncomfortable with the idea I understand that people don't really control who you're attracted to and who you have a crush on. She told me that they just exchange banter while at work but don't really talk to each other outside of work. She lets me check on her phone messages but I don't really check that often because I trust her.\n\nYesterday, she was at my house and was acting weird and just blurted that she and her crush kissed. She told me that it was the coworker who kissed her and she momentarily kissed back before she realized what she was doing. Now I don't know if this is trickle truth and frankly I don't give a fuck now. At the minimum she kissed another guy. Points to her for coming clean the day after, but I don't know how to proceed.\n\nWe both agreed prior that kissing is considered cheating. She told me she's willing to quit her job and find another one just to be away from him if that's what I ask of her. I can afford to support both of us financially if it comes to that. She owned up to it said she was willing to to do whatever it takes to make things right. I told her she can't go back in time. I slept on it and I'm still pissed off this morning.\n\nI just need advice on whether I should take her back or not. Does she still seem trustworthy? Is she likely to do it again? Do you have stories on when you took back a cheating girlfriend or boyfriend and it backfired or paid off?\n\nThe relationship had been great so far up until this point. I don't want to nuke a future with her if it can still be salvaged. I feel betrayed. I want to trust her but I feel like I shouldn't after this.

    "human": "This is your decision.\n\nYou agreed that a kiss is cheating, and therefore she cheated. That's plain. She is also regretful, owned what she did, and is willing to change jobs to be away from the person she kissed. That is a mature attitude to righting a wrong.\n\nA lot of people in this thread are going to say get rid of her. I understand the gut reaction. I also understand the foolish errors of youth, and she's 23. It's a learning experience, that's for sure. \n\nAsk yourself if you think trust can be restored. Are the things she's offered to make amends good enough? If roles were reversed, how would you feel?\n\nI do have a story about a cheating ex, but it was much more than a kiss, and she wasn't willing to take the steps to make amends. She wanted to pretend it didn't happen. Your girlfriend seems willing to do the work, and that's something.\n\nI'm well past my twenties, so for what it's worth, I'll say this: any long term relationship is going to be hard, and will have its challenges. Ask yourself if you see long term potential here. Would you like to have her beside you in ten years? In twenty? If so, this is your chance to set a dynamic of forgiveness and long term growth. If not, better not to invest more time.\n\nBut again, this is your decision alone. I hope what I've said offers some help.",

That takes courage and accountability. However, the fact remains that she did kiss someone else, and that's a betrayal of your trust.\n\nAs for whether she's trustworthy, it's difficult to say. While she came clean, it's possible that she may have been influenced by the situation and the emotions of the moment. It's also possible that she may not have fully thought through the consequences of her actions.\n\nRegarding the likelihood of her doing it again, it's impossible to predict with certainty. However, it's clear that she has a crush on this coworker and that she was in a vulnerable state when the kiss happened. It's possible that she may not have been thinking clearly or considering the potential consequences of her actions.\n\nAs for my personal experience, I don't have any stories about taking back a cheating partner, but I can offer some general advice. When considering whether to take your girlfriend back, ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Is she truly sorry for her actions and willing to work on rebuilding your trust?\n2. Is she willing to take steps to avoid similar situations in the future?\n3. Are you willing to work on rebuilding your relationship and addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to her behavior?\n4. Are you willing to take a chance on her again, despite the hurt and betrayal you've experienced?\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. You need to weigh the pros and cons and consider what's best for you and your relationship. If you do decide to take her back, make sure to set clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship moving forward.\n\nRemember, trust is built over time, and it's not something that can be regained overnight. If you do decide to work on rebuilding your relationship, it will require effort and commitment from both of you."

This way, you'll be more confident and have a few topics to draw from.\n2. **Start small**: Don't feel like you need to dive into deep, meaningful topics right off the bat.

Many companies with excellent insurance often have longer waiting periods or more stringent requirements.\n\nThat being said, here are a few companies that offer relatively short waiting periods or good insurance options:\n\n1. Teachers' unions: As you have a master's degree in education, you might consider working for a teachers' union. They often offer excellent health insurance, and some may have shorter waiting periods. Look into organizations like the National Education Association (NEA) or the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).\n2. Non-profit organizations: Many non-profits, especially those focused on education or healthcare, offer competitive insurance packages. Some examples include the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, or the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.\n3. Tech companies: Some tech companies, like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft, offer excellent insurance plans, but be prepared for a potentially longer waiting period.\n4. Government agencies: Government agencies, such as the Department of Education, often offer comprehensive insurance plans with shorter waiting periods.\n5. Healthcare companies: If you're interested in working in the healthcare industry, companies like Kaiser Permanente, Humana, or UnitedHealth Group might offer good insurance options.\n\nKeep in mind that these companies may have specific requirements, such as a certain number of hours worked per week or a minimum tenure period. It's essential to research each company's insurance policies and requirements thoroughly.\n\nBefore applying, I recommend reaching out to the companies you're interested in and asking about their insurance options, waiting periods, and any other relevant details. This will help you make an informed decision and plan for your surgery and future.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to prioritize your health and well-being.

    "human": "I'm not a citizen of US, but here in Europe you can break every contract in every way, for whatever reason. \n\nFirst of all, I don't know if it's a good idea to let someone you know inside the apartment, due to the dude's behavior you were talking before. \n\nDon't you have an early termination clause? That's fairly common I think..\n\nHere what I found that can be useful:\n\n\"There are very specific rules that must be followed to break a lease due to major defects. Here’s how to break a lease in CA under California Civil Code §1942.\n\nWhen a property is uninhabitable, a tenant can also choose to move out without notice. California Civil Code §1941.1 lists conditions that make a unit uninhabitable. This includes:\n\nA lack of effective waterproofing\nA lack of working heating\nA lack of hot and cold running water\nPlumbing or gas that is not in safe, working order\nA lack of electricity in good, working order\nConditions that may affect your health such as mold, insufficient ventilation, or unsanitary conditions\nIf your unit has major health or safety violations that make it uninhabitable, you must inform the landlord about the condition and give them a “reasonable” amount of time to correct it. The amount of time you need to wait isn’t legally defined and depends on the circumstances. You can further protect yourself by contacting the County Health Department or Building Inspector to document the conditions, getting statements from other tenants, and taking photos of the conditions.\"",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking a step back and considering your options carefully. Given the situation, here are some suggestions to help you navigate this potentially tricky situation:\n\n1. **Stay calm and don't engage:** It's essential to maintain your composure, especially when dealing with an aggressive or confrontational roommate. Avoid getting into an argument or escalating the situation, as it can lead to more problems.\n2. **Review your lease:** Since you didn't sign a personal guarantee or provide a co-signer, you're not personally liable for the entire lease. However, it's crucial to review your lease agreement to understand the terms and conditions. Check if there's a provision for subletting or assigning the lease to someone else.\n3. **Document everything:** Keep a record of all conversations, including dates, times, and details of what was discussed. This can be helpful in case things escalate and you need to prove your actions. Take photos of any relevant documents, such as the lease agreement, and keep them in a safe place.\n4. **Seek mediation:** Consider seeking mediation through your local tenant-landlord board or a neutral third-party mediator. They can help facilitate a conversation between you and your roommate to resolve the issue. This might be a more productive and less confrontational way to address the situation.\n5. **Be prepared for legal action:** If your roommate is unwilling to work with you, and you're unable to find a mutually agreeable solution, you may need to consider taking legal action. In California, you can file a complaint with the California Department of Real Estate or the local small claims court.\n6. **Plan your exit:** Since you've already found someone interested in taking over your lease, you can prepare for your departure. Make sure to:\n\t* Give your roommate written notice (30 days is standard in California) as required by your lease or local laws.\n\t* Leave the room in good condition, as per your lease agreement.\n\t* Ensure you're not responsible for any damages or unpaid rent beyond the sublease period.\n7. **Block him if necessary:** If your roommate's behavior continues to be aggressive or threatening, it's reasonable to block him to protect yourself. You can file a restraining order or report the incidents to the police if necessary.\n\nRemember, prioritizing your safety and well-being is crucial. Don't hesitate to seek help if you feel uncomfortable or threatened."

It has only happened once. I was so scared of losing her. I'm a piece of shit for it. I never came clean about it. It was selfish.  It has never happened gain. We are engaged now soon to be married we bought a house together. I am gonna ruin her life by having her marry me (I feel at least).

First, let me say that it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your mistake and want to make things right.\n\nYou're right, you did something hurtful and selfish, and it's not okay to keep it a secret. However, it's not just about what you did, but also about how you've handled it since then. You've had six years to think about it, and you've had the opportunity to grow and learn from your mistake.\n\nComing clean now, before the wedding, is a huge step. It's not an easy thing to do, but it's the right thing to do. You need to be prepared for the possibility that she might not be able to forgive you, and you need to be prepared to accept that.\n\nBefore you have this conversation, take some time to reflect on why you're doing this. Is it because you genuinely want to be honest and make amends, or is it because you're feeling guilty and want to clear your conscience? Are you willing to do the work to rebuild trust and earn back her respect?\n\nWhen you do have this conversation, be honest and take responsibility for your actions. Don't make excuses or downplay what you did. Be prepared to listen to her feelings and concerns, and be patient with her as she processes this information.\n\nRemember that forgiveness is a process, and it may take time. It's not about you being a \"piece of shit\" or deserving of forgiveness; it's about taking responsibility for your actions and showing that you're committed to being a better partner.\n\nLastly, don't expect her to forgive you just because you're apologizing. Forgiveness is a choice, and it's hers to make. What you can control is how you respond to her decision, whether it's forgiveness or not. You can choose to continue to work on yourself, to grow, and to become the partner she deserves.\n\nYou don't deserve her forgiveness, but you can earn it by being genuine, vulnerable, and committed to being a better person. Take this opportunity to reflect on your actions, and use it as a chance to become the person you want to be."

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's like your brain just can't help but relate everything to your own experiences. It's a common trait, but yeah, it can be annoying to others. Here's the thing: people generally don't want to hear about your problems or experiences when they're trying to talk about their own. It's like, you're hijacking the conversation and making it all about you.\n\nSo, here's what you can try: practice active listening. When someone's talking, really focus on what they're saying and try to understand their perspective. Don't just wait for your turn to jump in with your own story. Take a deep breath, nod along, and show you're engaged with what they're saying. You can even try summarizing what they said in your own words to show you're actively listening.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to set a mental timer for yourself. When you feel the urge to jump in with your own story, pause for a beat and ask yourself if it's really necessary. Is it adding to the conversation or is it just about you? If it's the latter, try to bite your tongue and let the other person keep talking.\n\nLastly, try to develop some empathy. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and imagine how they might feel if you're dominating the conversation with your own stories. Would you want to hear about someone else's problems all the time? Probably not. By showing you care about what they're saying and are genuinely interested in their thoughts, you'll build stronger connections and have more meaningful conversations.\n\nRemember, it's not about suppressing your natural tendencies completely, but about being more mindful and considerate of others in your interactions. With practice, you can become more aware of when you're doing it and make adjustments to be a better conversationalist."

As a woman with a background in working on classic cars, you've got a great foundation to build on. Here are some tips to help you navigate the negotiation process and get the best deal possible:\n\n1. Research, research, research:\nBefore you head to the dealership, research the market value of the car using tools like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, or NADAguides. This will give you a solid understanding of the car's worth and help you make a strong case for the price.\n2. Know your numbers:\nCalculate your budget and stick to it. You've already got 25% of the cost covered with cash, which is a great start. Consider how much you're willing to finance and what your monthly payments should be. Don't be afraid to walk away if the deal isn't right.\n3. Don't show your hand:\nDon't let the salesperson know how much you want the car or how much you're willing to pay. Keep your cards close to your chest and let them make the first offer. This will give you room to negotiate and make concessions.\n4. Be polite, but firm:\nRemember that the salesperson is trying to make a sale, not be your friend. Be respectful and courteous, but don't be afraid to walk away if the deal isn't right. You're not obligated to make a deal, and it's okay to say no.\n5. Ask questions:\nDon't be afraid to ask questions about the car's history, condition, and any repairs that have been done. This will show that you're informed and willing to do your due diligence.\n6. Don't fall for extras:\nDealerships often try to tack on additional features or services, like extended warranties or maintenance plans. Make sure you carefully consider whether you really need these extras and don't let the salesperson talk you into something you're not comfortable with.\n7. Don't be afraid to walk away:\nIf the deal isn't right, be willing to walk away. This shows the salesperson that you're not desperate and that you're willing to wait for the right deal.\n\nAs for your background in working on classic cars, don't be afraid to mention it! This can actually be a great conversation starter and may give you a bit of leverage in negotiations. Just be sure to keep the focus on the car and the deal, rather than trying to show off your mechanical skills.\n\nRemember, negotiation is a conversation, not a confrontation. Stay calm, be respectful, and be willing to walk away if the deal isn't right. Good luck, and I hope you get the car you want at a price you're comfortable with!"

It's not a reflection of your worth or social skills.\n\nTo \"crack open\" these conversations, try the following:\n\n1. **Observe and wait**: Before diving into a group, observe the dynamics for a bit. Notice who's talking, who's listening, and what topics are being discussed. Wait for a natural lull or a moment when someone seems to be wrapping up a thought. This will give you an opportunity to slip in without disrupting the flow.\n2. **Start with a nod or a smile**: Make eye contact with someone in the group and give a friendly nod or smile. This can help break the ice and show you're interested in being part of the conversation.\n3. **Use a gentle opener**: Instead of launching into a long story or asking a question that requires a lot of thought, try using a simple opener like, \"Hey, what's the best thing that's happened to you this week?\" or \"How's your weekend going?\" This can help you get a foot in the door and spark a conversation.\n4. **Find a common ground**: Try to find something you have in common with the group, whether it's a shared interest, a favorite TV show, or a recent event. This can be a great way to build a connection and get the conversation flowing.\n5. **Be patient and don't take it personally**: Remember that it may take some time for the group to warm up to you, and that's okay. Don't get discouraged if you don't immediately feel like you're part of the group. Keep being friendly, engaged, and interested, and eventually, you may find that the group opens up to you.\n\nRemember, the key is to be respectful and genuine in your approach. Don't try to force your way into the conversation or dominate the group. With a little patience and persistence, you can build connections with even the more reserved groups."

Here's a simple approach that might help:\n\n1. **Wait for a natural pause**: Try to wait for a moment when the conversation is naturally slowing down or someone is finishing their thought. This can be a great opportunity to slip in a friendly \"Hey, how's it going?\" or \"Hi, mind if I join you?\" without feeling like you're interrupting.\n2. **Use a gentle transition**: If you don't see a natural pause, try using a gentle transition to join the conversation. For example, you could say something like, \"Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation about [topic]. I've got some thoughts on that too...\" or \"Hi, I know you're in the middle of something, but I just wanted to say hi and catch up.\"\n3. **Show genuine interest**: When you do join the conversation, make sure to show genuine interest in what the others are talking about. Ask follow-up questions, share your own experiences or thoughts, and engage with the conversation. This will help you feel more like a valued participant rather than an interrupter.\n4. **Don't dominate the conversation**: Remember, it's okay to join the conversation, but don't dominate it. Keep your contributions brief and let others have their turn to speak. You can always follow up with more thoughts or questions later.\n5. **Practice makes perfect**: The more you practice joining conversations, the more comfortable you'll become. Try it out in low-stakes situations, like chatting with a coworker or friend, and see how it goes. You can always adjust your approach as needed.\n\nHere's an example of how you could put these tips into practice:\n\n[You walk up to a group of friends chatting at a party]\n\nYou: \"Hey, guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I saw you all from across the room and thought I'd come over to say hi. What's the topic of conversation?\"\n\nFriend 1: \"We were just talking about our favorite travel destinations.\"\n\nYou: \"Ah, cool! I've been thinking about planning a trip to Japan. Have any of you been?\"\n\nFriend 2: \"Actually, I went there last year! I highly recommend visiting Tokyo.\"\n\nYou: \"That's great! I've always wanted to try the food there. What were some of your favorite dishes?\"\n\nBy following these tips, you can join the conversation without feeling like you're interrupting or intruding. Just remember to be respectful, show genuine interest, and keep your contributions brief. Happy conversing!"

    "sentence": "TL;DR: How do I get my MIL to get out\n\nMother-in-law (MIL) and her husband lived originally in mainland China. Husband died suddenly and my Chinese wife (37F) invited her to come live with us. I (42M) accepted, thinking it would be temporary, and also a way to thank her for the donation for the condo's downpayment ($150k)\n\nThen the pandemic happened. Except for a short 2 months period, the mother-in-law has been living with us since summer 2019.\n\nWhile our apartment is modern, it only has 2 bedrooms and only 1 bathroom. We do have 2 kids and we live on top of each other now. There are frequent bathroom issues where one kid is peeing on the floor because the Mother in law has been in the bathroom for an eternity. Worse, I don't speak Mandarin/chinese and she is not learning English. \n\nI tolerated this during the pandemic because there was no travel possible. Now that the pandemic finishing, I find this less and less tolerable. I have tried multiple times discussing with wife how I've never accepted this situation, but she's not giving up anything or not really listening. The situation is good for her because she gets close to her mother. MIL also cooks half the time, cleans so she doesn't have to do any chores. The truth is her mother has an absurd amount of control on her daughter -- it's almost like daughter is still 12 years old and the MIL dictates how things should be.\n\nApart from the obvious bathroom issues and lack of space, the truth is also her MIL is putting a distance between us. Before we were quite close and now she's spending most time with her mum. If this continues, I'll actually become the odd one in the family.\n\nSince we have kids, I don't want any breakup or marriage issues. How would you approach this? Would go hard way and just tell wife it's unacceptable and MIL needs to GFTO or else? or would you do a soft approach ? Thanks for any answers. Looking to have a 1:1 with her this weekend\n\nnote : throwaway account",

I'll offer a balanced approach to help you navigate this challenging situation.\n\nBefore having a 1:1 conversation with your wife, I recommend taking some time to reflect on your own emotions and concerns. It's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and avoid blaming or attacking your wife. Instead, focus on expressing your feelings and needs in a non-confrontational manner.\n\nFor the conversation with your wife, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Start with a positive tone and acknowledge the benefits of having her mother-in-law live with you, such as the cooking and cleaning help.\n2. Express your concerns about the impact on your daily life, specifically the bathroom issues, lack of space, and the effect on your relationship with your wife. Avoid blaming or criticizing your wife, instead, focus on the practical challenges you're facing.\n3. Share your feelings about the distance growing between you and your wife, and how you miss the closeness you once shared.\n4. Emphasize your desire to find a solution that works for everyone, including your wife and her mother. Avoid making ultimatums or threats, as this can lead to defensiveness.\n5. Openly discuss the power dynamic between your wife and her mother, and how it affects your relationship. Be specific about the ways in which her mother's control is impacting your life.\n\nSome possible phrases to use during the conversation:\n\n* \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about living with your mom. I appreciate the help with cooking and cleaning, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with the bathroom situation and lack of space. I miss our alone time and feeling like we're not as close as we used to be.\"\n* \"I feel like your mom's influence is affecting our relationship, and I'm struggling to find my place in the family. I want us to find a way to make this work for everyone, but I need some changes to happen.\"\n* \"I know your mom is important to you, but I'm feeling like I'm losing my connection with you. Can we find a way to balance your needs with my own?\"\n\nIt's essential to listen actively to your wife's perspective and concerns, and be willing to compromise. Avoid getting into arguments or debates, as this can escalate the situation.\n\nIf the conversation doesn't lead to a resolution, consider involving a mediator, such as a therapist or counselor, to help facilitate a constructive discussion. Remember that finding a solution will likely require patience, empathy, and understanding from all parties involved.\n\nAs for the mother-in-law, it's crucial to approach the conversation with her separately, focusing on the practical issues and your own feelings. Avoid blaming or criticizing her, and instead, express your concerns in a respectful manner. You might say:\n\n* \"I understand that you're going through a tough time, and I appreciate your help with cooking and cleaning. However, I'm finding it challenging to manage the bathroom situation and lack of space. Could we discuss possible solutions, such as finding alternative arrangements or adjusting our daily routine?\"\n* \"I value our relationship, but I'm feeling like we're growing apart. I'd like to find ways to reconnect and strengthen our bond. Could we schedule regular one-on-one time or plan activities together?\"\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed."

She does this once or twice a month. I miss her so much while she's away and sometimes get anxious thinking about anything bad happening to her on the flight back home.\n\nDays without her are just regular days, I go to work, come back home, have dinner with our daughter, then she'll go to sleep and I'll be in our room wishing she was there. Sometimes I read, play videogames, etc., and it certainly helps but still feel bad she's away. Videocalls or phone calls don't help that much to be honest, they kinda just make me long for her more.\n\nAnd sometimes there's also an anxious feeling of \"if we don't spend that much time together on weekdays and she leaves sometimes for 2 weekends a month, I'm afraid I'll regret how little time we spend together years from now\".\n\nLike, OK, I understand feeling a bit sad but not angsty teenager levels of sad. I've also tried to think of it more like \"she's out there being good at her job, makes me so proud of her\" and it kinda didn't work. \n\nHow to not feel so sad when she's away?\n\n**tl;dr:** Wife leaves for work one or 2 weekends a month.

    "human": "Some of this is very sweet, but some of it sounds like you might be suffering real seperation anxiety, particularly the parts about worrying something bad might happen, or worrying that you might regret the time apart in the future ( which seems complex, because you're already suffering now, why are you concerned about suffering again for the same thing in the future? That seems exhausting.)\n\nSo there might be some healthy expected sadness about being seperated, but there could also be some anxiety which is actually at a level where it becomes disruptive. Talk to your wife about this, but also talk to a professional.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's normal to feel sad and miss your partner when they're away, especially if it's for an extended period. It's great that you're aware of your feelings and willing to work on it.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging your feelings is a huge step. It's okay to feel sad and it's not about being an \"angsty teenager.\" It's natural to miss your partner and feel a sense of emptiness when they're not around.\n\nNow, let's tackle the practicalities. Since you have your daughter to take care of, that's a great distraction. Maybe try to focus on quality time with her during the day, engage in activities that you both enjoy, and make the most of your time together. This will not only make the days pass more quickly but also create positive memories.\n\nRegarding the evenings, it's understandable that videocalls and phone calls don't help as much. Instead, try to focus on self-care and personal growth. Use this time to pick up a new hobby, learn something new, or work on a personal project. This will help you feel more fulfilled and less like you're just waiting for your wife to come back.\n\nRegarding your concerns about not spending enough time together, I'd say it's natural to have those thoughts. However, instead of dwelling on the negative, try to focus on the positives. You're making sacrifices for your wife's career, and that's something to be proud of. You're supporting her goals and ambitions, which is a beautiful thing.\n\nLastly, I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings. Share your concerns and worries with her, and ask her how she feels about your situation. It's possible that she's also feeling anxious or guilty about being away, and talking about it can help you both find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel sad, but don't let it consume you. Focus on the positives, take care of yourself, and communicate openly with your wife."

Because of my job I had to move out of the state and we've been long distance relationship for over 6 months now. Ever since I've left, I noticed she stopped wearing the engagement ring. While we're on the phone I would ask if she's wearing it and she would say no. She says she doesn't want to \"dirty it\" and wants to save it. But she doesn't wear anything else on the ring and it makes me feel weird. She really was excited to get engaged and loved it, and now she doesn't even wear it. And it doesn't make me feel any better that she has a job that interacts with a lot of people and many people compliment her on how pretty she is. \n\nLately, we got into some heated arguments about the ring and my expectations of her to wear it regularly as I have spent 2.5 months wage into buying her a ring she dreamed of. She says \"it's not like we're married\" and doesn't really wear it. It got pretty heated and I was annoyed so out of frustration I said \"if you're not going to wear it, you might as well as give it back\". I felt like the least she could do was wear an engagement ring how to commitment to each other but she won't do that. So she won't wear the ring (or anything else on the ring finger) nor will she give me the ring back. \n\nI told her we can start planning on getting married once our job will align in the same state (which may take about another 6-12months). Am I being unreasonable to expect her to wear the ring regularly?\n\nEdit: few things that are coming up so I wanted to provide clarity \n\n1. The ring is comfortable for her. It's not too tight or bothersome when she wears it. She's been given other alternative such as silicone ring and Tiffany band to wear since she wanted to save the engagement ring but won't wear bands as \"those are for married people\".\n2. I wasn't staking a claim by getting engaged early. In fact, she was the one who wanted to get engaged super early and even wanted to move in with me. She would tell me daily how her ring finger is empty and how it needs something shiny on it. I was happy with her and saw a good future together, so I tapped into my savings to give her what she wanted (I wanted too). \n3.

Here is the crux of the issue. \n\nThis sounds like you both seem to be insecure in the relationship and doubting each others commitment. \n\n- You - because she won’t the ring regularly \n- Her - because you don’t seem to want to get married any time soon. \n\nThis is a fundamental issue of a breakdown in trust and lack of care and respect for managing each others wants and expectations. Again, This does not seem like a good foundation for a marriage \n\nHave you considered from her perspective that it seems like you’re not as committed to her and a future marriage? Because *you* don’t see the need to “rush”’into a marriage. And that *your* options and YOUR wants seem to take precedence over hers? Eg YOU don’t want to rush into a marriage. YOU want her to wear a ring. What about her wants?\n\nYou BOTH need to learn how to see each others points of view and respect each another’s\nwants, and learn to compromise and negotiate a solution.

She might have valid reasons for not wearing the ring, and it's possible that her concerns about \"saving\" it are genuine. It's also possible that she's feeling overwhelmed or stressed about the distance and the future of your relationship, which could be affecting her desire to wear the ring.\n\nRegarding your expectation that she should wear the ring regularly, it's understandable, but it might be a bit unrealistic, especially given the circumstances. You mentioned that she's not married, and many people don't wear engagement rings until the wedding day.

    "base_reply": "I understand your concern. It's great that you've worked on managing your emotions and avoiding conflicts, but it's also important to acknowledge that it's normal to experience physical reactions to intense emotions. The shaking is likely a result of the adrenaline rush, as you mentioned.\n\nTo help manage this, I'd suggest a few strategies to maintain your calm centeredness during conflicts:\n\n1. **Breathe deeply and slowly**: When you start to feel the adrenaline surge, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help slow down your heart rate and calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for a count of four, and exhaling for a count of four. Repeat this process several times.\n2. **Ground yourself**: Pay attention to your five senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. This can help you focus on the present and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n3. **Use a physical anchor**: Choose a physical sensation that helps you feel grounded and centered, such as squeezing your hands into fists, or pressing your feet firmly into the ground. This can serve as a physical anchor to help you stay calm.\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you develop greater awareness of your physical sensations and emotions. This can make it easier to recognize when you're starting to feel the adrenaline rush and take steps to manage it. Try incorporating mindfulness exercises into your daily routine, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n5. **Communicate assertively**: When engaging in conflicts, try to focus on expressing your needs and feelings in a clear and respectful manner. Avoid aggressive or confrontational language, which can escalate the situation and increase adrenaline levels. Instead, aim for a calm and assertive tone.\n6. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practicing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or yoga can help you develop a greater sense of calm and reduce overall stress levels. This can make it easier to manage physical reactions to conflicts.\n7. **Seek support**: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you develop coping strategies for managing conflict and anxiety. They can also provide support and guidance on how to maintain your calm centeredness during difficult situations.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel some physical reactions to intense emotions, and it's not necessarily a sign of weakness. By practicing these strategies, you can develop greater control over your physical responses and maintain your calm centeredness during conflicts."

Naturally, we planned for him to visit me for a week. It was going as usual at first, then I started noticing some strange behavior. We normally cuddle after sex but this time he wanted to cuddle and kiss pretty much 24/7. Then, he started talking about \"if we were a couple\" scenarios. He also talked about hypothetical scenarios like what would our families and friends think if we were together. And towards the end of the trip he kept calling me babe, and would get upset when I don't hold his hand in public.\n\nHe would joke about us having kids in the middle of sex, and when we're not at it he would ask things like \"I wonder how our kids would be like\". I have a condition that makes it dangerous for me to have kids, so he would randomly mention how he feels bad I can't have kids, eventhough I told him I never wanted kids to begin with. The way he says this and follows it by \"I've always wanted kids\" makes me a bit uneasy.\n\nThe thing that made me confirm he caught feelings the most is when he asked me how I saw him, I said he's a really good friend and that apart from that I'm really sexually attracted to him. He was visibly disappointed, then he joked \"so that's all I am to you, a sex toy\". I asked him the same and he said he feels more affection than sexual attraction.\n\nHe asked me to visit him next week, so I sat him down and explained my concerns that maybe we shouldn't see each other often to avoid catching feelings. His only response was that he already decided he wont be sleeping with anyone else, and that it's up to me what I want to do.

You've already expressed your concerns, and it's great that you're willing to have another discussion to re-establish boundaries.\n\nHere's a suggestion for approaching the conversation:\n\n1. Acknowledge his feelings: Start by acknowledging that you appreciate his feelings and that it means a lot to you that he's willing to be open and honest.\n2. Reiterate your boundaries: Clearly reiterate your boundaries and the reasons why you can't be in a romantic relationship. Be gentle but firm, and avoid giving false hope.\n3. Emphasize the importance of friendship: Let him know that you value your friendship immensely and that you don't want to lose it. You can express your gratitude for the role he's played in your life and how much you cherish the memories you've shared.\n4. Set boundaries for the future: Discuss what you're comfortable with in terms of physical intimacy and how you can maintain a healthy, platonic friendship. You might consider setting boundaries around how often you'll see each other or how you'll communicate.\n5. Be prepared for his reaction: He might be upset or disappointed, but it's essential to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries. Remember that you're doing this for your own well-being, and it's okay to prioritize that.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be kind but firm. You're not obligated to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable or compromises your values. Take your time, be honest, and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize self-care during this conversation. Make sure you're prepared for any outcome and have a support system in place. You got this!"

    "sentence": "How to not talk awkwardly in front of others English is my second language, and even though I have been rid of my accent long ago and learned to speak it properly, I still talk really awkward around others, I know it's an English problem, cause I never struggled with my first language and could usually strike a conversation with nearly anyone who spoke it.\n\nI usually find that others either ignore me in a group conversation, or don't add anything to the conversation with me and just ignore me in general, and i'm unsure why",
    "human": "Try taking a course in public speaking.  They're designed to get you over any anxiety you might have about speaking in public.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's tough to navigate social situations in a second language, even when you've made significant progress. It's great that you've worked on your accent and pronunciation, but there's more to effective communication than just language skills.\n\nFirstly, it's normal to feel awkward in social situations, even for native speakers. It's a common phenomenon, and it doesn't mean you're not good enough or smart enough. It's just a matter of getting used to the dynamics of group conversations and building connections with others.\n\nNow, let's tackle the issue of others ignoring you in group conversations. There could be a few reasons for this:\n\n1. **Lack of common ground**: When you're speaking in a second language, you might not be able to pick up on the same references, jokes, or cultural nuances that others are sharing. This can make it harder for others to connect with you on the same level.\n2. **Different communication styles**: People have different communication styles, and what works for one person might not work for another. For instance, some people might be more reserved or introverted, while others are more outgoing. Try to be patient and adapt to the group's dynamics.\n3. **Language barriers**: Even if you've mastered the language, there might still be some nuances or idioms that you're not familiar with. This can make it harder for others to understand you or for you to understand them.\n4. **Self-perception**: Sometimes, our own insecurities or self-perception can affect how others perceive us. If you're feeling anxious or self-conscious about speaking in a second language, this can make it harder for others to connect with you.\n\nTo improve your social interactions, try the following:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Focus on understanding others and showing interest in what they're saying. This will help you build connections and make others more likely to engage with you.\n2. **Find common ground**: Try to find topics or interests that you share with others. This can be a great way to build bridges and create connections.\n3. **Be patient and observant**: Pay attention to the group's dynamics and adapt to their communication style. Don't be afraid to ask questions or clarify things you don't understand.\n4. **Join smaller groups or one-on-one conversations**: Sometimes, smaller groups or one-on-one conversations can be less intimidating and allow for more meaningful connections.\n5. **Celebrate small wins**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't immediately click with others. Celebrate small victories, like having a successful conversation or making a new friend.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and build connections gradually. Focus on being yourself, being respectful, and showing genuine interest in others. With time and practice, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your social interactions."

    "sentence": "Tldr: I stalked my partners ex on fb and it turned out to be a much older woman than he implied and not the girl in a photo he showed me. Should I confront him? \n\nI've been with my partner for almost a year now and we're fully in love, I know that many will comment on our age gap, but honestly it has never bothered me. We met through a local wildlife rescue group that we both volunteer for and were friends first, but there was definitely an immediate attraction and chemistry.\n\nAnyway when we first got together he told me he dated a woman for about 4 years, but she ended up taking advantage of him financially so he ended it. He showed me a picture of her, she was a gorgeous brunette, tbh it made me feel quite insecure as she was dressed to the nines and I'm a much more natural kind of girl. I said I didn't want to see any other pictures.\n\nToday I was telling my best friend about a family (his) event I went to on the weekend and she said she wanted to see these people so I told her to look them up on Fb. I hardly ever use it but thought Id take a look at their pics too. I saw a few groups photos from an event a few years back and in every one my partner had his arm around an older blond lady, I didn't think much of it, family friend etc. Then I looked at a friend list and spotted his exs name, the profile picture was of a beautiful young brunette and an older blond lady. I presumed the brunette was his ex (I'm brunette). I kept looking through and there were more and more pictures of my partner with the older blong lady, on holiday, at dinner and such, the brunette was tagged as her daughter.\n\nSo it's obvious the older blond lady is his ex, he told me she was a few years older than me but I'd say she's mid 50s at least and he showed me a picture of someone else that made me insecure. My partner and I have always said that we would practice radical honesty, but he's clearly lied to or misled me about this. Should I confront him about it? The past is the past and does it really even matter? Should I just let it go? I feel like he may have lied about it through his own insecurities and I can understand and forgive that.\n\nEDIT: To clarify I don't think the photo he showed me was of his ex's daughter, I think it was of a random girl, as when I saw the photos of her daughter I did think they didn't look like the same person.  I was just super confused by the whole scenario and presumed it must have been the young brunette. And by yound I mean mid thirtiesish...",

I absolutely hate that kind of behaviour and think that between you, you are almost 100 years old and should be over playing games like teenagers.\n\nJust ask him about it, and then gauge his reaction. If he’s honest and contrite that’s one thing, if he’s defensive and rude then kick him to the curb.\n\nOh then listen to “cut your bangs” by girl pool. Small lies fester imo.

I'm glad you're taking the time to think carefully about how to approach this situation.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable that you felt insecure when he showed you that picture of the brunette. It's natural to feel that way, especially when someone presents a curated version of their past to you.\n\nNow, about whether you should confront him... I think it's a good idea to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about what you've discovered. However, I would suggest doing so in a calm and non-accusatory manner. Approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging that you both agreed to practice radical honesty.\n\nIt's possible that your partner may not have intentionally set out to deceive you, but rather was trying to avoid hurting your feelings or minimize the impact of his past. By having an open conversation, you can work together to clear the air and rebuild trust.\n\nBefore you talk to him, take some time to gather your thoughts and feelings. Think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Consider asking him questions like:\n\n* Why did you show me a different picture of your ex?\n* What was your intention behind not telling me the truth?\n* How do you think this affects our relationship and our commitment to radical honesty?\n\nRemember that you deserve honesty and transparency in your relationship. It's okay to feel hurt and betrayed, but try not to assume the worst about your partner's intentions. Approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to work through this together.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this conversation. If you feel like you're not being heard or if the conversation becomes too overwhelming, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you ready to have this conversation with your partner?"

We both have areas of expertise and our own interests but no matter what the topic is, he always believes that he knows more than me in any subject or he is better at everything or he is more than me in everything.(More athletic, better social skills, better dressed, better at doing things etc.) I have started feeling uneasy around him. Everytime we are talking on something random, something none of us are experts of, he thinks his opinion is more valid. Most of the times i have to take out my phone and show him google to convince him I'm right and even then he is like 'yeah i guess you have a point but i was right in a way anyway' ( even him being 'right' is quite a stretch.)

I stayed at his place once and asked for a cover to sleep, he told me to get one from the closet, there were some thick quilts so i picked a thin bedsheet to use, he was annoyed because ' do you know this is not a quilt to cover yourself when you sleep, this is a bedsheet' and obviously i do know and prefer that. \n\nOr we were going to go somewhere on his bike and i had a very tight skirt on, so i told him I'd change into shorts. I picked a short jumpsuit and he was like ' let me see, well isn't that a dress so basically it is same as skirt' and i told him it was a jumpsuit and the bottom of it was not like a skirt more like a shorts. He didn't believe me. I had to physically show him how it is like a shorts to make him believe it was not a dress. That is a jumpsuit i own and have worn a million times yet he believe i don't know the difference between a skirt and shorts or smt?\n\nOr we were on the road to a new place I'm not very familiar and told me to open the navigation on my phone because he was driving. I let him know i don't usually drive and i don't know the roads and i don't really know around here so I'll just pick a random place in the town we're heading to see the general direction we are supposed to go then put my phone for him to follow navigation. The navigation took us to the general direction of the town but not the center as he wanted and he was extremely annoyed at my incompetence.  He was like 'How can you not do even such a simple thing?' and i felt really embarrassed.\n\nWe are getting along great and have a really good time other than that, i usually like talking to him (unless it is a bit of funny thing i know about this and that and he thinks I'm wrong), i do think he is very smart and he is very kind/nice mostly.\n\nDo you think his attitude should be a deal breaker or a sign of a worse character trait/red flag?\n\n I have tried to talk to him about this issues and he seemed to listen and understand but after that when this topic was mentioned, he was like 'yes i know you are very sensitive and emotional getting upset easily over small things' so i don't think he really understood. Or maybe i am in fact very emotional and sensitive? I don't know.\n\nTL;DR; The guy I'm dating thinks I'm not as smart, knowledgeable or capable as him and shows it very openly.

    "base_reply": "I'm so glad you reached out for advice! It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and uncomfortable in this situation.\n\nFirstly, let me say that it's completely normal to feel uneasy and self-conscious when someone consistently belittles your opinions, abilities, or preferences. It's not about being sensitive or emotional; it's about being treated with respect and dignity.\n\nWhile it's great that you're having a good time with him otherwise, these constant put-downs and condescending comments can erode your self-esteem and make you question your own abilities. It's essential to recognize that this behavior is not okay and is likely a sign of a deeper issue.\n\nIt's also concerning that he doesn't seem to understand your concerns or takes them as a sign of emotional instability. Healthy communication involves listening actively, acknowledging the other person's feelings, and working together to find a solution. If he's not willing to do that, it may indicate that he's not interested in building a mutually respectful and equal partnership.\n\nI would say that his attitude is a significant red flag, and it's essential to consider whether this behavior is something you're willing to tolerate in a long-term relationship. You deserve to be respected, valued, and appreciated for who you are, and it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nBefore making a decision, take some time to reflect on what you want from a relationship and what you're willing to accept. Ask yourself:\n\n* Are you comfortable with being constantly belittled or corrected?\n* Do you feel like you're being treated as an equal partner, or are you being treated like a subordinate?\n* Are there other signs of disrespect or manipulation in the relationship that you're overlooking?\n\nIf you're unsure or feeling anxious about the relationship, consider taking a step back and re-evaluating whether this is a healthy and sustainable partnership for you.

This can be a sign of interest and attraction.\n2. **Body language**: Leaning in when talking, angling their body towards you, or mirroring your movements. People often unconsciously mirror those they're interested in.\n3. **Touch**: Light, casual touch, like a gentle tap on the arm or a playful nudge. This can be a way to build physical connection and intimacy.\n4. **Proximity**: Finding excuses to be near you, sitting or standing close, or \"accidentally\" bumping into you.\n5. **Flirtatious language**: Teasing, playful banter, or using humor to break the ice. This can be a way to build rapport and create a sense of playfulness.\n6. **Active listening**: When someone is genuinely interested in getting to know you, they'll often actively listen to what you're saying, ask follow-up questions, and show interest in your thoughts and feelings.\n7. **Smiling**: A warm, genuine smile can be a sign of attraction and friendliness.\n\n**Signs that might not necessarily mean flirting:**\n\n1. **Casual friendliness**: Some people are just friendly and outgoing, and their behavior might not necessarily be flirtatious.\n2. **Polite conversation**: People might be simply being polite and courteous, without any romantic intentions.\n3. **Overcompensation**: Some individuals might overcompensate with friendly behavior to hide their own shyness or social anxiety.\n\n**Tips specific to your situation:**\n\nAs a 30-year-old new to social interactions, it's natural to be unsure about reading social cues. Here are some additional tips:\n\n1. **Take your time**: Don't rush to conclusions. Give people space and time to show their true intentions.\n2. **Pay attention to consistency**: If someone is consistently friendly and attentive, it might be a sign of genuine interest. If it's just a one-time thing, it might be a coincidence or politeness.\n3. **Observe the context**: Consider the setting and situation. Are you in a professional or social setting? Is the person in a relationship or known to be friendly?\n4. **Don't overanalyze**: Try not to overthink every interaction. Focus on building genuine connections and relationships, rather than trying to read between the lines.\n5. **Practice self-reflection**: Take time to reflect on your own behavior and intentions. Are you coming on too strong or misinterpreting friendly behavior as flirting?\n6. **Communicate openly**: If you're unsure about someone's intentions or feel uncomfortable, don't hesitate to ask them directly. Honest communication can clear up any misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, social interactions are complex, and people can be unpredictable.

For example, \"Hey, I was thinking about our agreement to split the bill, and I wanted to check in on when you're planning to settle up. I value our friendship and I'd love to move forward with a clean slate.\"\n2. **Be specific and clear**: When you do ask for the money, be specific about the amount and the context. This can help avoid misunderstandings and make it easier for your friend to take action. For instance, \"Hey, I lent you $X for Y expense, and I'd really appreciate it if you could pay me back by [date].\"\n3. **Use a \"I\" statement**: Instead of saying \"You owe me,\" say \"I've lent you\" or \"I'm waiting to be paid back.\" This helps shift the focus from blame to your own actions and feelings. For example, \"I've lent you $50 for the concert tickets, and I'm waiting to get it back.\"\n4. **Show appreciation**: Acknowledge your friend's efforts and express gratitude for their friendship. This can help put both of you in a positive mindset. For instance, \"Hey, I appreciate you reaching out and saying you'll get the money to me soon. That means a lot to me.\"\n5. **Set a deadline (but don't be too strict)**: If you need the money by a certain date, it's okay to mention it. However, be flexible and understanding if your friend needs more time. You can say, \"I'd really appreciate it if you could get the money to me by [date], but if that's not possible, let's discuss a new timeline.\"\n6. **Don't guilt trip or pressure**: Remember that your friend is an adult and has their own financial priorities. Avoid making them feel guilty or pressured to pay you back ASAP. Instead, focus on the value of your friendship and the importance of resolving the debt amicably.\n7. **Follow up politely**: If your friend doesn't respond or misses the deadline, send a polite follow-up message. You can say, \"Hey, just wanted to check in and see if you're still planning to pay me back. No rush, just wanted to keep things clear.\"\n\nRemember, asking for money is a normal part of life, and it's okay to do so. By being clear, respectful, and considerate, you can minimize the discomfort and maintain a strong friendship."

You can sell them on local online marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, or Letgo. You might be surprised at what people are willing to buy.\n4. **Ask a neighbor or friend for help**: Although you mentioned family isn't an option, you might have a neighbor or friend who could help you out. Be honest about your situation and ask if they'd be willing to lend you the money or help you find a solution. You can also offer to pay them back or return the favor in the future.\n5. **Visit a local pawn shop**: If you have any valuable items that you're willing to part with, visit a local pawn shop. They might give you a decent price for items like jewelry, electronics, or tools.\n\nRemember, these options might not make you rich, but they can help you make that $200. Be realistic about your expectations and prioritize your safety and well-being above all.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that this is a temporary solution to help you get through this difficult time. It's essential to start working on a long-term plan to get back on your feet. Consider reaching out to local non-profit organizations or government agencies that provide assistance with rent and employment services. They might be able to offer guidance and support to help you get back on track."

I can't seem to get into a proper routine or habit. I used to be better than this. Back then, I was extremely organized, had a schedule, and wrote in my agenda with color-coding. That was 8 years ago, before depression hit. I am not the same person anymore. I am easily overwhelmed now.\n\n\nBut my mindset is not giving up. I am constantly asking for help online, googling skills, watching videos of people cleaning, hearing others stories or TedTalks... but that still isnt helping.\n\nLately I did stick to a small morning routine (yay): wake up, pee, brush teeth and invisalign as my baby roams around on the floor, change baby's diaper, feed cats upstairs. Successfully, I have been doing this consistently for the past month EVEN IF I AM LATE TO WORK, I make sure I still do all the above.\n\nAnd then I go downstairs and nothing is done because all I do is feed baby breakfast as we watch baby shows as I multitask working remotely. 8 hours pass with just lunch again, tv still on, and cuddle with baby on couch for naps as I type with one hand.\n\nIt's dinner time and I have not done dishes. Or cooked. Or had time to grocery shop. So I order out. Watch tv with dinner. Go upstairs and sleep. The end.\n\n(Sometimes when I go to work in the office, I try to pump myself up by treating myself to starbucks.

It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for maintaining your morning routine despite being late to work! That's a great accomplishment, and it shows that you're capable of creating habits. Now, let's break down your challenges into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Stop beating yourself up over \"not being the same person\"**: It's normal to feel like you've lost your footing due to depression and anxiety. You're not the same person, and that's okay. You're still capable of growth and improvement.\n2. **Reframe your mindset**: Instead of focusing on what you're not doing, focus on what you are doing. Celebrate your small wins, like maintaining your morning routine. This will help shift your mindset from negative to positive.\n3. **Create a \"starting ritual\"**: Before you start your workday, create a simple ritual that signals to your brain that you're ready to work. This could be as simple as making a cup of tea, stretching, or doing a quick 5-minute meditation.\n4. **Batch similar tasks**: Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, batch similar tasks together. For example, dedicate specific times of the day for work, self-care, and household chores. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n5. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This could be reading a book, taking a walk, or practicing yoga. Schedule these activities in your day, just like you would any other important task.\n6. **Gradually build habits**: Don't try to change everything at once. Start by adding one new habit or task to your daily routine each week. This will help you build momentum and confidence.\n7. **Find alternative energizers**: Since Starbucks is no longer working for you, try finding other ways to boost your energy. This could be taking a short walk outside, listening to music, or practicing deep breathing exercises.\n8. **Ask for help when needed**: Don't be afraid to ask for help from family, friends, or a professional when you're feeling overwhelmed. Having a support system can make a huge difference.\n9. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes. Remember that it's okay to not have it all together, and that you're doing the best you can.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.\n\nBaby steps:\n\n* Start by adding one new habit or task to your daily routine each week.\n* Begin with a 10-minute timer and challenge yourself to focus on a single task without any distractions during that time.\n* Gradually increase the timer duration as you build your focus and endurance.\n\nRemember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're not alone, and you're capable of making progress. Keep moving forward, and don't give up on yourself."

    "sentence": "How to stop comparing myself to other people. A great deal of my anxiety comes from comparing my situation to others. It is often very distracting because I am often never focused on what *I* should be doing to better my life.",
    "human": "[This could suck but it works for me] I find that comparing myself to others isn't the issue because that is the only real measure anyone has to measure themselves. I think the issue for a lot of people comes from how they use the comparisons. I tend to look at what I like in people and I want to emulate that aspect of them. This leads to me both liking that person more for recognising a good thing about them and also  gives me goals for how I could be doing better in my life. But this is just the opinion of one kid so take with ample salt ^^",
    "base_reply": "Comparing yourself to others can be a major source of anxiety and distraction. Here's the thing: it's a fundamental human tendency, but it's not serving you well. It's time to shift your focus inward and cultivate self-awareness.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that comparison is a habit. Recognize when you're doing it, and gently bring your attention back to yourself. Ask yourself, \"What's my intention behind this comparison? Am I trying to feel better about myself or worse about someone else?\" Be honest with yourself.\n\nNext, practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone's journey is unique, and it's impossible to compare apples to oranges. Focus on your own strengths, accomplishments, and progress. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nAnother strategy is to set clear, personal goals for yourself. When you're focused on your own objectives, you'll naturally stop worrying about what others are doing. Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks, and track your progress. This will help you stay present and motivated.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your thinking. Instead of comparing yourself to others, ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this person? How can I apply their strengths or strategies to my own life?\" This mindset shift can help you grow and improve without getting caught up in competition.\n\nRemember, it's okay to acknowledge that others may be doing better in certain areas, but it's not a reflection of your worth or potential. You are unique, and your path is yours alone. Focus on nurturing your own growth, and the anxiety will start to dissipate.\n\nGive it some time, and you'll find that you're more focused on your own journey, rather than comparing yourself to others."

However, as a college student living away from family it is so difficult for multiple reasons. \n\nI am a gay male, with that comes completely being considered a sin in the muslim community or even within the religion, apparently. So, why would i be apart of a religion that doesn’t accept me? I began to push myself away from the religion and now it’s Ramadan. I cannot even explain that feeling of guilt thats just rooted within me because I don’t want to partake in it. I have to lie to my parents and family in saying i am doing it, but im not. \n\nI was never given a choice in whether I wanna be religious or not anyways, I was simply just born into it. And that is so unfair and no one should EVER be born into a religion, it should be a choice. Anyways, after realizing and accepting myself in that I am not a straight male (and  because of that, my literal existence is a sin), and that i don’t agree with most of the views in that religion, I dont wanna be apart of it. But, that feeling of guilt will always be with me, forever. Being told growing up that your parents will have to suffer if their kids are not religious, or following the religion is traumatizing. It sucks and it is so mentally draining.\n\nHow can i ease this feeling of guilt?",

Regret, loneliness, longing; holidays are strong, cultural times. Maybe you miss the cultural side of it. You may not be able to celebrate Rahmadan with your family, but your college community may have you.

It's understandable that you're grappling with the weight of societal expectations, family pressure, and your own identity. I'm here to offer some guidance, not to tell you what you want to hear, but to help you find a path forward.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to question the religion and its teachings, especially when they don't align with your personal beliefs and values. It's also okay to acknowledge that you were born into a religion, and that's not a choice you made. It's unfair, and it's natural to feel resentful about it.\n\nRegarding the guilt, it's essential to separate your identity from the religion. You are more than your sexual orientation, and your existence is not a sin. You are a unique individual with your own strengths, talents, and worth. Remember that your sexual orientation is not a choice, and it's not something to be ashamed of.\n\nTo ease this feeling of guilt, I suggest you try the following:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Remind yourself that you're not defined by your guilt or your religious beliefs.\n2. **Seek support**: Reach out to people who understand and accept you for who you are. This might be friends, family members, or support groups. Having a safe space to discuss your feelings can be incredibly liberating.\n3. **Reflect on your values**: What matters most to you? What kind of person do you want to be? What kind of relationships do you want to have? Focus on those values and principles, and let go of the guilt associated with your religious upbringing.\n4. **Create a new sense of purpose**: Find activities, hobbies, or passions that bring you joy and fulfillment. This can help shift your focus away from guilt and towards a more positive, empowering direction.\n5. **Consider counseling**: If you're struggling to cope with the guilt and anxiety, consider seeking the help of a therapist. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember, you don't have to carry the weight of guilt and shame. You are not defined by your religious beliefs or your sexual orientation. You are a unique individual with the power to create your own path and identity.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that it's okay to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to rush into making decisions or declarations. Take small steps towards self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-love. You got this!"

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish a \"computer-free\" zone in your home, like your bedroom, to help you associate it with sleep and relaxation. Make it a rule to not bring your computer into this zone.\n2. **Schedule computer time**: Plan out your computer use in advance. Allocate specific times for studying, work, and leisure activities. Stick to these schedules as much as possible.\n3. **Remove temptations**: Consider deleting gaming apps, social media, or other distracting programs from your computer or phone. You can always reinstall them later if you need them.\n4. **Use website blockers or apps**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocused can block access to distracting websites or apps during certain times or periods. This can help you stay focused on your goals.\n5. **Find alternative ways to relax**: Instead of reaching for the computer, try relaxing techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or a warm bath. You can also read a book, listen to music, or practice yoga.\n6. **Reward yourself**: Instead of rewarding yourself with computer time, try doing something else you enjoy, like taking a walk, cooking a meal, or practicing a hobby.\n7. **Monitor your usage**: Keep track of your computer use using apps like RescueTime or Moment. This can help you identify patterns and stay aware of your habits.\n8. **Consider a \"cool-down\" period**: When you finish a study session or work, take a 30-minute break to relax before returning to your computer. This can help you transition and avoid mindless scrolling.\n9. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. This can help you feel more satisfied and less inclined to turn to your computer as a crutch.\n10. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Changing habits takes time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Instead, acknowledge the setback and gently get back on track.\n\nAs for your laptop, consider upgrading to a more capable device that can handle your needs. This might help reduce your frustration and make it easier to stay focused.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it may take some experimentation to find the right balance.

    "base_reply": "The frustrating and draining experience of dealing with \"help-rejecting complainers\"! It's essential to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being when dealing with these individuals. Here are some tips to help you navigate these situations:\n\n1. **Acknowledge their feelings**: Validate their emotions, but avoid getting drawn into their problems. Show empathy without taking on their burden. For example, \"I can see why you're upset about this situation.\"\n2. **Set clear boundaries**: Establish what you're willing and not willing to do to help. Be specific and firm, but polite. You can say, \"I understand you're struggling, but I'm not comfortable offering advice. What do you think you can do to address this issue?\"\n3. **Don't take it personally**: Remember that their complaining is often a coping mechanism or a way to seek attention. Try not to internalize their negativity or feel responsible for their problems.\n4. **Offer support, not solutions**: Instead of offering advice, ask open-ended questions that encourage them to think critically about their situation. This can help them feel more empowered and less reliant on others. For example, \"What do you think you could do to tackle this problem?\"\n5. **Don't enable**: Avoid doing things for them that they could do themselves. This can create a pattern of dependency and reinforce their help-rejecting behavior.\n6. **Re-evaluate the relationship**: If their complaining is consistently draining and unproductive, it may be time to reassess the relationship. Ask yourself if this person is a positive influence in your life, and if the benefits of the relationship outweigh the costs.\n7. **Practice self-care**: Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. Engage in hobbies, exercise, or spend time with positive, supportive people to maintain your emotional well-being.\n8. **Model healthy behavior**: Show others how to deal with challenges by taking care of yourself and seeking help when needed.

Here is an example of what my computer looks like right now: http://i.imgur.com/0QScKf1.png\n\nI feel like I'm crushing myself under electronic clutter and unattended business (make doctor appointment, plan vacation, get car washed, etc.). I have a lot of anxiety all day long, and I don't know if it's caused by or is causing this clutter (probably both), but I think I would feel better if I could stop letting all this junk pile up on top of me. Do you have any thoughts about what I can do to help myself?\n\nNotes on the image...\n\n* Chrome tabs: these are from weeks and weeks of YouTube videos (music, guitar lessons, other random stuff), open Google searches I never followed through on, random links from Reddit, Yelp searches for certain types of restaurants in certain areas, etc. My tabs always look like this.\n\n* Chrome bookmarks: this is a scary set of interlocking rabbit holes. I have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks in my toolbar. Every few years I put everything into a big folder named \"organize\" (sometimes \"ORGANIZE!!!\"). See the folder on the far left.

I am certain that I'll never look through 99.99% of them, but whenever I try to use a folder system and/or only bookmark things I know I'll actually return to, I fail. I seem to be unable to control my crazy hoarder-level bookmarking behavior.\n\n* Gmail inbox: note that these are only *starred* emails. I have 140 starred emails in my inbox, and I only give an email a star when I think it will require some kind of future action. I probably will never look at 90% of these starred emails again. My unstarred inbox 'only' has about 25 emails in it, but 23 of those are emails I sent to myself as a reminder to do something (change diet, tell someone about something, buy something, watch some movie or show, look up a musician, make an appointment, etc.).

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're acknowledging the feeling of being overwhelmed and seeking help. It takes courage to confront the clutter in your digital life.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people experience clutter and procrastination, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or productivity. It's a common challenge that can be addressed with intentional habits and strategies.\n\nTo tackle your digital clutter, I recommend starting with small, manageable steps. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Chrome tabs:\n\t* Close unnecessary tabs immediately. If you need to revisit a tab, bookmark it or add it to a reading list.\n\t* Set a timer for 10-15 minutes and focus on one task. When the timer goes off, take a short break before moving to the next task.\n2. Chrome bookmarks:\n\t* Begin by deleting or archiving bookmarks that are no longer relevant. You can also consider using a bookmark manager extension like Pocket or Raindrop.io to categorize and prioritize your bookmarks.\n\t* Set a goal to review and organize your bookmarks in small chunks (e.g., 10-20 bookmarks at a time). This will help you make progress without feeling overwhelmed.\n3. Gmail inbox:\n\t* Start by tackling your starred emails. Go through them one by one and either:\n\t\t+ Take action on the task or decision required\n\t\t+ Archive or delete the email if it's no longer relevant\n\t\t+ Set a reminder for a specific task or follow-up\n\t* Consider implementing a \"2-minute rule\": if an email requires less than 2 minutes of your time, take care of it immediately. If it requires more time, schedule a task or reminder.\n4. Email reminders to yourself:\n\t* Identify the types of reminders you send yourself (e.g., tasks, appointments, etc.). Create a centralized system for tracking these reminders, such as a task list, planner, or app.\n\t* Set a rule to delete or archive self-sent emails once the task is completed or the reminder is no longer relevant.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Practice the \" Pomodoro Technique\": work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n* Schedule regular \"digital decluttering\" sessions (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to maintain your progress.\n* Consider implementing a \"done\" list to track your accomplishments and reflect on your progress. This can help you stay motivated and encouraged.\n\nRemember, decluttering your digital life is a process that takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't feel like you need to tackle everything at once. Start with small steps, and you'll be on your way to a more organized and manageable digital life.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the impact of clutter on your mental well-being. Taking control of your digital space can have a positive impact on your anxiety levels and overall sense of calm."

Life changes, opinion changes and some other stuff has brought out conflict in our relationship, but we kept working on it. Today we were talking about one of the conflicts and he said he needed to make up for mistakes he’s made. I asked what he meant by this, and he proceeded to tell me 2 months into our relationship he did something he regrets to this day. He said we had a fight and that night him and his best friend decided to have a girl over for some “fun”. This girl went to high school with them and was currently talking to his best friend. It was planned that they’d have a threesome. My bf said that right before “it” went down, he panicked and left. I asked what happened prior, and he said everything besides actual sex but he still did stuff and saw her naked. I immediately got upset and told him I couldn’t be around him right now. He tried to convince me to stay and talk, but I had to get out of there. He keeps blowing up my phone saying how sorry and stupid he was then and that he should have told me sooner. Should this be something to work on? Is ignorance really bliss in this situation? I fee conflicted because I am so hurt by this discovery, but it was so many years ago.

The fact that he kept this secret for so long and only shared it with you now, when you're already having issues in your relationship, is concerning.\n\nWhile it's true that it happened 5 years ago, the fact that he's only now sharing this information suggests that he may have been hiding it from you for a long time. This could be a sign of a deeper issue with his trustworthiness and willingness to communicate openly with you.\n\nAs for whether ignorance is bliss, it's not necessarily the case. You have a right to know the truth about your partner's past, especially if it involves something as significant as a sexual encounter with someone else. Keeping secrets and hiding the truth can lead to feelings of resentment, mistrust, and even emotional abuse.\n\nIt's essential to take the time you need to process your emotions and consider what you want to do next. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel safe, respected, and trusted.\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. Do you feel like you can work through this and rebuild trust with your partner?\n2. Are you willing to accept that your partner kept this secret from you for so long, and are you prepared to address the underlying issues that led to this behavior?\n3. Do you feel like you can move forward and have a healthy, open relationship with your partner?\n\nRemember, you don't have to make any decisions right now. Take the time you need to think, reflect, and prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nIt's also important to consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you navigate this difficult situation. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to process your emotions and work through your thoughts.\n\nLastly, remember that you deserve to be treated with respect, honesty, and integrity in your relationship. Don't rush into anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or uncertain."

That's a great start!\n\nBefore you make your move, take a step back and consider a few things:\n\n1. **Get to know her better**: Since you've only interacted with her at work, try to learn more about her outside of the office. Ask her questions about her hobbies, interests, or weekend plans. This will help you build a stronger connection and might give you a better sense of her availability.\n2. **Be respectful of boundaries**: Remember that even if she's single, she might not be interested in a romantic relationship or might not be ready to pursue anything.

She cuddles and claws me with her tiny needles, purring with love. Starting at around 5:30 am she meows at me and pats my face until I get out of the bed. It doesn't matter if I feed her or not. Her favorite pastime is just harassing me while I'm trying to be unconscious.\n\nI need sleep.\n\nWe can't go on like this... We simply can't, my fluffy friend. My mind will collapse if you keep interrupting my sleep cycle! I'm not LIKE you... I need a large, expansive swath of uninterrupted sleep every night, my absurdly small G. \n\nThe icing on the cake is that my newish boyfriend has a very serious dislike of sleeping with a cat. :(\n\nLast night, I tried closing the bedroom door and she just meowed and then wailed without end for hours until I gave in and opened it. Should I just try to deal with cat wailing for an indefinite amount of nights until her heart hardens?\n\nAnyone got any ideas? Thanks, guys!!",

It's essential for your well-being, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact your cat's behavior is having on you.\n\nNow, let's tackle this issue step by step:\n\n1. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Try to establish a calming pre-sleep routine for your cat. You can do this by:\n\t* Feeding her a light meal or snack about an hour before bedtime to help her wind down.\n\t* Providing some quiet playtime or a puzzle toy filled with treats to keep her occupied.\n\t* Giving her a gentle massage or some soothing petting to help her relax.\n2. **Block access to the bedroom**: Since closing the door didn't work, let's try something else. You can:\n\t* Install a baby gate or pet gate at the bedroom door to restrict her access. This will help her get used to not being able to enter the room.\n\t* Place a soft blanket or towel at the entrance to make it uncomfortable for her to jump in.\n3. **Provide alternative sleeping spots**: Make sure your cat has a comfortable and cozy spot to sleep nearby. You can:\n\t* Set up a cat bed or blanket near your bedroom door, so she can sleep close to you without being in the bed.\n\t* Place a heated cat bed or a warm towel in a nearby room to make it inviting.\n4. **Distract her from meowing**: When she starts meowing at 5:30 am, try:\n\t* Ignoring her for a bit (I know, it's hard, but it's essential to not reinforce the behavior).\n\t* Offering a treat or toy to distract her from meowing.\n\t* Speaking calmly and soothingly to her to calm her down.\n5. **Gradually phase out attention**: To help your cat understand that meowing won't get her what she wants, try:\n\t* Ignoring her for longer periods each time she meows.\n\t* Only responding to her meows after a set period (e.g., 15-20 minutes) to teach her that silence is rewarded.\n6. **Communicate with your boyfriend**: Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about the situation. Explain how you're feeling and what you're trying to do to address the issue. Work together to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, it may take some time for your cat to adjust to these changes, so be patient and consistent. With persistence and positive reinforcement, you can help your cat learn to respect your sleep and your boyfriend's boundaries.\n\nHang in there, and I hope you start getting the restful sleep you deserve soon!"

He, too, has passed away.\nMy mother believes that my aunts, uncles and cousins on my father’s side are still her relatives because they are related to me. She says she is still the aunt to my cousins on that side of the family. My brother adds to this dilemma by bringing Mom to some of these family gatherings where my paternal aunts ignore her and my cousins ask why she is there. She seems hurt by this.\nSo is Mom still a part of my dad’s family? She has nieces from her second marriage, but she has never included me in those gatherings, and I don’t even know them. Are these unknown cousins relatives to me?",

However, it sounds as if they are not interested in being related any longer, in which case, they don’t have to be. The same goes for your stepcousins. Unless you are suddenly interested in getting to know them better, you do not need to consider yourself related.",

However, it's also important to acknowledge that her husband's remarriage and eventual passing doesn't automatically grant her a new family connection with his relatives.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, your mom's connection to your father's family is through your father, and when he passed away, that connection was severed. While she may still be your mom, she is no longer part of your father's family in the classical sense.\n\nAs for her nieces from her second marriage, they are indeed your first cousins once removed (since you share a set of grandparents but not a set of parents). However, it's understandable that she may not have included you in their gatherings, as you were already established in your own family dynamic with your father's side of the family.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your mom's decision not to include you in her second husband's family gatherings may have been a way for her to maintain a sense of distance or separation from that family, which is a common coping mechanism for people dealing with loss or complicated relationships.\n\nTo navigate this situation, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your mom about how you feel. Let her know that you understand why she might feel hurt by her former in-laws' behavior, but also acknowledge that her connection to their family is no longer biological. You could also encourage her to set boundaries or maintain a healthy distance from that family if it's causing her more harm than good.\n\nAs for her nieces from her second marriage, you could suggest reaching out to them and building a relationship with them, even if it's just occasional phone calls or online chats. It's never too late to establish a connection with family members, and it might be a positive way to expand your family network.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being in all of this, and try to have empathy for both your mom's feelings and the complexities of the situation."

When I chose to take a number of challenging classes, I adopted a habit of leaving the hardest assignments till the end. My grades are slowly slipping and I am constantly pulling multiple all-nighters just for homework and tests. After every brutal night of black coffee and no sleep, I tell myself, \"I will NEVER procrastinate again. I will plan a studying schedule for each class and use my time wisely\" but it has just become a never-ending cycle. I've read plenty of articles and watched plenty of videos on beating procrastination but their tips haven't worked for me. Maybe I'm just having trouble focusing? Should I consider taking Adderall or some type of concentration medication (if anything like that exists)? Wow, I'm procrastinating right now typing up this LPT request and avoiding my literature essay.",
    "human": "Procrastination is a habit, and changing habits takes a sustained effort over a long period of time. You basically have to slowly chip away the old habit and incrementally replace it with the new habit. Don't try to change everything overnight; you will get overwhelmed and feel like it's impossible. Instead pick one small thing to start doing as soon as possible instead of as late as possible; maybe pick one class and make a point of doing it's homework the minute you get home. Once you have that first class under control add another one, then another, etc.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking the first step by acknowledging your struggles with procrastination and seeking help. It's great that you've tried various tips and strategies, but it's clear that they haven't stuck. I'm here to offer some honest advice, and I'll try to help you break this cycle.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the idea of Adderall or concentration medication. I want to caution you that these medications are not a magic solution to your problem. While they might provide temporary focus, they can have significant side effects, and it's crucial to consider the potential risks before resorting to medication. Additionally, addressing the root causes of your procrastination is more important than just masking the symptoms.\n\nNow, let's focus on the underlying issues. Procrastination often stems from underlying emotional, psychological, or environmental factors. Have you considered the following:\n\n1. Fear of failure: Are you afraid of not meeting your own expectations or the expectations of others?\n2. Perfectionism: Do you feel like you need to do everything perfectly, leading to an overwhelming sense of responsibility?\n3. Lack of clear goals or priorities: Are you unsure what you want to achieve, making it hard to focus on what's important?\n4. Time management: Are you using your time wisely, or are there other factors (e.g., social media, TV, video games) competing for your attention?\n5. Self-care: Are you taking care of your physical and mental well-being, including getting enough sleep, exercise, and relaxation time?\n\nTo break this cycle, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Identify your underlying reasons for procrastination: Reflect on your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. What's driving your procrastination? What are your fears, and what are you trying to avoid?\n2. Set realistic goals and priorities: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Focus on one task at a time, and prioritize the most important ones.\n3. Create a schedule and stick to it: Plan out your day, including dedicated time for studying, relaxation, and self-care. Use a planner, app, or timer to stay on track.\n4. Eliminate distractions: Identify the things that distract you the most (e.g., social media, email, phone notifications) and eliminate them while you work. Use tools like website blockers or apps that help you stay focused.\n5. Reward yourself: Set small rewards for yourself when you complete tasks or reach milestones. This can be something as simple as taking a short break, going for a walk, or enjoying a favorite snack.\n6. Seek support: Share your struggles with a trusted friend, family member, or counselor. Sometimes, talking through your feelings and getting support can help you gain perspective and motivation.\n7. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes or slip up. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to make progress, not perfection.\n\nRemember, breaking the cycle of procrastination takes time, patience, and self-awareness. It's not about finding a quick fix or a magic solution. It's about understanding yourself and developing healthy habits that promote productivity and well-being.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to take this moment to reflect on your goals and priorities. What's truly important to you? What do you want to achieve in the short and long term? Write down your goals and keep them somewhere visible to remind yourself of what you're working towards.\n\nYou got this!"

    "sentence": "I’m a first-year teacher at an urban Title I middle school. As is common for many teachers in my position, I’m using my personal paycheck to cover the gaps that classroom funding doesn’t. After I realized at the beginning of the year that many of my students were having trouble concentrating, I started keeping a stash of healthy snacks near my desk. The students know they can come take a snack when they need one. The costs add up quickly, but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make if it helps my kids focus.\nNot long after I started keeping the food in my room, I began noticing it disappearing dramatically between the time I left each afternoon and the time I clocked in the next morning. The only staff who have a key to my room are the custodians and the administrators—both of whom are fed a meal by the cafeteria if they work nights. Because I rarely stay late enough to see the night staff in person, I started leaving notes on the snacks, stating that they were for students. When that didn’t work, I eventually hid them in my desk or closet (neither of which lock). They were still being taken. I weighed my options and realized I was either going to have to stop buying food for the kids or tell someone, so I mentioned what was happening to our head of facilities. Unbeknownst to me, our head of security hid a camera in the classroom, caught the custodian who was stealing, and promptly fired him.\nMy students’ food is no longer disappearing, but now I have another problem: All my co-workers hate me! The administrative assistant told anyone who would listen what happened, and now everyone is angry that I caused someone to lose his job. Some of the other teachers had also grumbled in the teachers’ lounge about food going missing from their rooms, so I know I’m not the only one who was upset, but apparently I broke some unspoken rule about tolerating food theft. Was I wrong to report it? I’m seriously considering quitting because so many people are suddenly being hostile and treating me like an entitled Karen.",
    "human": "It’s safe to assume that the overnight custodial staff continued to take food from your classroom for the same reason your students do—because they or someone in their family needed it, and the single meal provided by the school was insufficient to meet their needs. People who steal food usually need food very badly, and while you’re not personally responsible for the collective social failure that’s led to so many of your students’ and colleagues’ food insecurity, I do think it’s important to “tolerate” food theft in as much as it seems to me an act of desperation that requires additional support, not punishment, and certainly not unemployment. Your former colleague was already struggling with hunger (or supporting a hungry relative) while working; now he’s got joblessness on top of that to contend with. You say the administration installed cameras and fired the man “unbeknownst to [you],” but you could reasonably have anticipated that reporting would lead to such a consequence, so I think it’s important to acknowledge your direct, intentional role in this man’s firing. The fact that your colleagues were also concerned about food going missing does not necessarily mean that you made the right choice. Yes, it’s frustrating and often expensive to lose food at work, but remember the circumstances—a night janitor at a school where many of the students are going hungry likely has limited options.\nLet’s then consider the other options you had available to you, bearing in mind that you, your students, and all of your co-workers—faculty and staff alike—have been forced into very difficult situations: You could have taken the snacks home with you in your bag at the end of the day, which might have been inconvenient but not impossible. You could have purchased an inexpensive portable safe, or a cheap bike lock to shut your desk drawer with overnight. Alternatively, you could have banded together with your fellow teachers and set up a community “fridge” where anyone could leave food and anyone could take it as needed, or pushed the school administration to do so officially. You could have left a note for the night staff letting them know you’d set aside something in particular for them, since their regular overnight meal clearly isn’t enough. Reporting the loss of snacks was not the only choice you had, and it did result in your colleague losing his job and making his life significantly worse. Your fellow teachers’ anger is understandable, and I’d encourage you to use this discomfort to reconsider your position and look for ways to try to make amends (directly to this man if possible, and to others in need of help if not), rather than quitting in a fit of pique.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you'd want to address the issue of food theft, especially since it was impacting your students' well-being. You were doing something kind and generous, and it's not unreasonable that you'd expect some support from your colleagues.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to acknowledge that you might have handled the situation in a way that didn't take into account the potential consequences. While it's not your fault that the custodian was stealing, reporting it to the head of facilities without discussing it with your colleagues or the custodian first might have been perceived as a betrayal.\n\nIt's possible that your colleagues felt like you were snitching on someone without giving them a chance to address the issue themselves. This can create a sense of mistrust and resentment, especially in a close-knit community like a school.\n\nBefore considering quitting, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your colleagues about what happened. Explain your motivations and the impact it had on your students. Acknowledge that you didn't mean to cause harm and that you're willing to work together to find a solution.\n\nIt might also be helpful to have a conversation with the head of facilities and the head of security to get a better understanding of the process they went through and why they chose to fire the custodian. It's possible that there were other factors at play that you're not aware of.\n\nRemember, as a teacher, you're not just a provider of snacks, but also a role model for your students. Your actions have consequences, and it's important to think about how they might impact those around you. However, it's also important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. Many teachers face similar challenges, and having a support system can make all the difference.\n\nTake some time to reflect on what you could have done differently, and then approach the situation with empathy and understanding. You might be surprised at how much more understanding and support you can find if you approach it in a collaborative way."

It's a big vulnerability, and it's natural to feel anxious or unsure about how the other person will respond.\n\nSecondly, his neutral response doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't feel the same way.

It's okay to give him space and let him process his feelings in his own time. Continuing to enjoy your time together and not stressing about it is a great approach.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take things at his pace, and it's not uncommon for people to not feel the same level of emotions at the same time.

It's not about judging or shaming each other, but about finding ways to communicate and compromise.\n\nAs for your concern about the double standard, you're right that there is often a different expectation around men and women's sexuality. It's important to recognize that these expectations are societal and not necessarily based on reality. Both men and women have the right to express their sexuality in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them.\n\nUltimately, the key is to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your needs and boundaries. With a little creativity and compromise, you can find ways to make sure both of your needs are met."

    "sentence": "My bf (Josh) and gf (Anna) met in college so they were friends for 2 years before meeting me. I met the both of them and we all really hit it off and quickly became friends then realized we actually wanted to date each other. Not to sound cliche but we don't really want to put labels on it, we aren't poly or anything like that. We just all want to be with each other and care for each other so.\n\nJosh and Anna never dated before me but I know from talking to them about their shared past that things were leaning romantic. It sounds like they were always kinda into each other but Josh wanted a relationship and Anna didn't. From what I know, Anna did want to have sex with Josh but he's really not into casual sex and it was really important to him that the first woman he was with would be someone like a gf and not a fling.\n\nI'm not insecure our jealous about their past because they made me see that without me, they were not even a couple and it's only with me that they can work. I'm like the secret ingredient. We just all work with each other like that. We're really good at communication and we all know that we have to work at our relationship maybe even more than traditional couples because our situation is unusual. Both Josh and I were virgins so we really talked a lot about boundaries and expectations surrounding our first time. We all wanted to all have sex together at least at first, but we always said that Josh and I would lose our virginities to each other just because that was really special to us.\n\nWe took things slow and did everything as we should. Tonight felt like the night it would all finally happen. What really ended up happening was that Josh and Anna had sex. We were all kissing and touching and things were going well and I felt really comfortable. I'll admit I didn't get on top of him or anything like that to signal my intention but then again neither did she. He simply just literally got between her legs instead of mine. Instead of being turned on by it I just got this really horrible feeling in my stomach especially because of how he was looking at her. Like she was everything that really mattered to him. He obviously was done pretty fast and I was just not in the mood for anything so we all just sort of wound down at that point. I was and am so disoriented and didn't want to ruin things so I didn't tell them I was really bothered. I don't know, I felt like it was obvious I was upset but later as I was trying to sleep I could hear them kissing and start to have sex again. I told them I'm tired and I need to be up early tomorrow and I went to the other room. Neither one of them even checked on me until well after which only makes me imagine how they must've had sex or cuddled so many more times. Like just being really happy by the two of them without me, which actually feels like cheating.\n\nI just wanted to get some second opinions before talking to them today like what do I even say? I don't know if I'm in the right to be jealous. If he wanted to have sex with her, he could have done that before. He specifically didn't want to. I know he feels the same way about the both of us I just really don't understand why I was excluded.\n\nTL;DR = my bf and I always said we'd lose our virginities to each other but he actually lost his virginity to our gf instead. What to do?",
    "human": "Sounds like you were the 3rd wheel who gave them the push to be together. \nMaybe they'll add you or discard you now, you'll have to see. \n\nThe question for you now is, do you want to be their 3rd wheel or maybe prefer a more traditional coupling?",
    "base_reply": "Wow, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling upset, hurt, and confused.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's normal to feel jealous and excluded when you feel like you're being left out of an intimate moment that's supposed to be special to all three of you.\n\nI want to address the elephant in the room: Josh did break his promise to you about losing his virginity with you. That's a significant breach of trust, and it's natural to feel hurt by that. However, it's also important to consider the context and the fact that Josh has a history with Anna, which may have influenced his actions.\n\nIt's not about whether Josh \"should\" have had sex with Anna; it's about the fact that he chose to, and you feel left out and hurt as a result. You have every right to express your feelings and concerns to Josh and Anna.\n\nBefore talking to them, take some time to process your emotions and gather your thoughts. When you do talk to them, be honest and open about how you're feeling. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing language.\n\nHere are some suggestions for your conversation:\n\n1. Start by expressing your feelings: \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you both about what happened tonight. I felt really hurt and left out when I saw Josh and Anna having sex. I know we all said we'd lose our virginities to each other, and I feel like that promise wasn't kept.\"\n2. Share your perspective: \"I understand that Josh has a history with Anna, but I thought we had an understanding about our own relationship. I feel like I was excluded from something special, and it makes me wonder if my feelings are important to you both.\"\n3. Ask questions: \"Can you guys help me understand what happened? Was it just a momentary lapse, or was there something else going on?\"\n4. Set boundaries: \"Going forward, I want to make sure we're all on the same page. I need to feel like my feelings and boundaries are respected in our relationship. Can we work together to find a way to make that happen?\"\n\nRemember that relationships require communication, compromise, and trust. It's possible that Josh and Anna didn't realize the impact of their actions, and they may be willing to work with you to find a solution. Approach the conversation with an open mind, and be prepared to listen to their perspective as well."

    "base_reply": "Given your family history, it's wise to take proactive steps to support your brain health. Here are some actionable tips to help you maintain your mental health and potentially reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's or dementia later in life:\n\n1. **Stay physically active**: Regular exercise has been shown to promote blood flow to the brain, boost cognitive function, and even reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\n2. **Eat a brain-healthy diet**: Focus on consuming:\n\t* Fatty fish (e.g., salmon, sardines) rich in omega-3 fatty acids\n\t* Leafy greens (e.g., spinach, kale) and other vegetables\n\t* Berries (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) and other fruits\n\t* Whole grains (e.g., brown rice, quinoa)\n\t* Nuts and seeds (e.g., walnuts, chia seeds)\n\t* Olive oil and other healthy fats\n3. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help clear out beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress can harm your brain health. Engage in stress-reducing activities like:\n\t* Meditation or mindfulness exercises\n\t* Yoga or tai chi\n\t* Reading or listening to music\n\t* Spending time in nature\n5. **Challenge your brain**: Engage in mentally stimulating activities, such as:\n\t* Learning a new language or skill\n\t* Puzzles, brain teasers, or strategy games\n\t* Reading books or articles on various topics\n\t* Solving problems or creative tasks\n6. **Stay socially engaged**: Social connections are crucial for brain health. Make time for:\n\t* Regular social interactions with friends and family\n\t* Joining a club, group, or organization that aligns with your interests\n\t* Volunteering or participating in community activities\n7. **Get regular check-ups**: Regular health check-ups can help identify potential health issues early on. Schedule annual check-ups with your primary care physician and consider genetic counseling to discuss your family history.\n8. **Consider supplements**: Certain supplements, such as:\n\t* Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., EPA and DHA)\n\t* B vitamins (e.g., B6, B9, and B12)\n\t* Magnesium and other minerals\n\t* Ginkgo biloba and other herbal extracts\n\nHowever, please consult with your doctor before adding any supplements to your routine, as they may interact with medications or have side effects.\n\n9. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help maintain cognitive function and overall health.\n10. **Practice gratitude and self-care**: Focus on the present moment, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your mental well-being. Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\n\nRemember, a healthy lifestyle is just one part of the equation.

I remained very calm and she  made it clear she almost wanted to hit me\n\nShe told me to go live at my mom's but I don't really want to. I asked to be alone in MY apartment, not to go somewhere else\n\nSo here's the question : How would you deal with this situation ?\n\nIf  that matters : Reasons mostly include taking care of the house. I have  to ask her to do chores and we don't have the same expectations. I like a  tidy home, she doesn't really care. I do most of the chores.

If you feel so strongly about this, maybe it's time to rethink the relationship because if you're truly compatible with somebody you live with, you wouldn't need this kind of time out.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're seeking advice, and I'll try to provide a nuanced perspective. It sounds like you're at a breaking point, and I'll try to help you navigate this situation.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your girlfriend's reaction to your request was understandable, given the history of issues and the suddenness of your proposal. It's natural for her to feel hurt, angry, and defensive.\n\nAs you mentioned, you've had issues with household chores and expectations for months, and it's clear that these problems have been building up. It's not surprising that you're feeling overwhelmed and want some space.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consider the impact of your request on your girlfriend. By asking her to leave, you're essentially telling her that she's not meeting your needs and that you need space from her. This can be a significant blow to her self-esteem and sense of security in the relationship.\n\nBefore taking any further action, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Acknowledge her perspective and the hurt she's feeling, and try to understand her point of view. It might be helpful to reiterate that you love her and value your relationship, but you need some space to recharge and work on yourself.\n\nSince you've already tried leaving home for a few days and it didn't work, it might be more effective to focus on finding a compromise within your current living situation. You could try having a more detailed conversation about the household chores and expectations, and work together to find a more balanced solution. This might involve setting clear responsibilities, creating a schedule, and finding ways to make the space more comfortable for both of you.\n\nIt's also important to consider that, as the owner of the apartment, you have more power in this situation. However, you've mentioned that you love your girlfriend and don't want to take drastic measures. It's crucial to weigh the potential consequences of your actions and consider the long-term effects on your relationship.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize the importance of empathy and understanding in this situation. Try to see things from your girlfriend's perspective and acknowledge her feelings. Remember that relationships are about compromise and working together, not about one person always getting their way.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything specific you'd like to try or any concerns you have about navigating this situation?"

We also have a friend who I call T because she’s basically the focal point of the story. \n\nT is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don’t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it’s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it’s still disrespectful because by calling him \"him\" I’m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. \n\nEventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that’s basically what’s important. He said that it’s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn’t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. \n\nI talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it’s okay.

What's important is that you're willing to listen, learn, and adapt.\n\nGoing forward, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friend T about how you feel. Acknowledge her concerns, and explain that you didn't mean to disrespect your boyfriend or his identity. Apologize again for the mistake, and ask her to help you understand why she's upset.

It's not just about reciting your name, major, and interests (although those are important details). A good introduction is about showing your personality, being authentic, and making a connection with the other person.\n\nHere's a simple formula you can follow:\n\n1. Start with a friendly greeting: \"Hi, my name is [Your Name], nice to meet you.\"\n2. Add a brief personal touch: This could be something about your interests, hobbies, or a fun fact about yourself. Keep it light and conversational.\n3. Show your enthusiasm: Share why you're excited to be there, whether it's for a class, event, or just to meet new people.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Hi, my name is [Your Name], nice to meet you. I'm a [Your Major] student and I'm really excited to be taking [Class Name] this semester. When I'm not studying, I love hiking and trying out new restaurants. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you and learning more about each other's interests.\"\n\nRemember, the key is to be yourself, be concise, and show genuine interest in the other person. Don't worry too much about being perfect – people are more likely to remember someone who is authentic and friendly.\n\nPractice makes perfect, so try introducing yourself to a friend or family member before tackling those social events. And don't be too hard on yourself if you stumble – it's okay to make mistakes. Just laugh it off and keep going!\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take your time and not be too pushy. Take a deep breath, relax, and let the conversation flow naturally. Good luck, and I hope you make some great connections!"

Start by researching neighborhoods and areas you're interested in living in Colorado. Look into the commute time to your partner's work, local amenities, and safety. You can use online resources like Zillow, Redfin, or neighborhood websites to get a sense of the area.\n2. Begin looking for apartments that offer month-to-month leases or short-term rentals (3-6 months). These options might be more flexible and allow you to adjust to your situation. You can search on websites like Zillow, Trulia, or Craigslist. Be cautious when using Craigslist, and make sure to verify the legitimacy of the rental property.\n3. Consider working with a local real estate agent who's familiar with the Colorado rental market. They can help you find a place that fits your needs and budget.\n4. For Airbnb, you can search for short-term rentals (1-3 months) or extended stays. Be aware that these options might come with additional fees and restrictions.\n5. When searching for rentals, be prepared to provide proof of income for both of you. Since your partner has a consistent proof of income, that's a plus. For your part-time gig work, you might need to provide a letter from your employer or a statement showing your average income over a certain period.\n\nRegarding your variable income, it might affect your ability to rent an apartment. Landlords often prefer stable, consistent income. To remedy this situation:\n\n1. Consider getting a letter from Doordash or your gig work platform verifying your income. This might help alleviate concerns about your income stability.\n2. Look for apartments that accept gig workers or have flexible income requirements. Some landlords might be more open to considering applicants with non-traditional income.\n3. Be prepared to provide a detailed breakdown of your income, including your average earnings per week/month. This can help demonstrate your financial stability.\n4. If you're having trouble finding an apartment that accepts your income, consider saving up for a security deposit or working with a co-signer (if needed).\n\nRegarding cosigners, it's understandable you'd like to avoid this option if possible. However, if you do need a cosigner, consider the following:\n\n1. Reach out to a trusted family member or friend who has a stable income and good credit. They might be willing to help.\n2. Look into local non-profit organizations that offer rental assistance or co-signing programs. These organizations might be able to help you secure a rental property.\n3. Be prepared to provide a detailed budget and financial plan to demonstrate your ability to manage the rental payments.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that you'll need to consider additional costs like utilities, internet, and furniture when renting an apartment. Make sure to factor these expenses into your budget.\n\nRemember to prioritize your financial stability and security during this transition.

He has to choose to stop. \n\nSo, accept he smokes or if it's a deal breaker then move on. \n\nUnfortunately this is all you can do (source: i used to date an alcoholic and wasted a year trying to stop his addiction)",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and unsure about what to do.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that finding out someone you love is lying to you is a huge betrayal. It's natural to feel angry, hurt, and confused.\n\nBefore we dive into what to do next, let's take a step back and acknowledge that your boyfriend's behavior is concerning. He's lied to you about something significant, and that's a red flag.\n\nIt's not about the cigarettes specifically; it's about the fact that he's not being truthful with you. This could be a sign of a deeper issue, such as a lack of self-awareness, impulsivity, or a fear of being honest.\n\nSince you're feeling stuck and don't have family to talk to, I want to offer some advice:\n\n1. Take some time to process your emotions: It's essential to acknowledge and work through your feelings before making any decisions. Write in a journal, talk to a trusted friend or therapist, or engage in a relaxing activity to help calm your mind.\n2. Have an honest conversation: When you're ready, have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Be specific about what you've observed and how it makes you feel. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, \"I feel hurt and betrayed when I find out you're hiding things from me\" instead of \"You're always lying to me.\"\n3. Evaluate the relationship: Take this opportunity to reflect on the state of your relationship. Are there other areas where your boyfriend is dishonest or secretive? Have you noticed any patterns of behavior that make you uncomfortable? Consider whether this is a sign of a deeper issue or if it's a one-time mistake.\n4. Set boundaries: If you decide to work through this with your boyfriend, set clear boundaries around what you're comfortable with and what you're not. Make it clear that you expect honesty and transparency in your relationship.\n5. Consider seeking professional help: If you're struggling to navigate this situation or if you're feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or a therapist for individual support. A professional can help you work through your emotions and develop strategies for moving forward.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, trusted, and heard. Take your time, prioritize your own well-being, and make decisions that align with your values and goals."

    "human": "It'll sound simple but take a second to compose/organize your thoughts into some kind of structure, whether chronologically or by relevance, before speaking.  Thinking of synonyms to the keywords may also help, as well as removing any extra words or tangents not directly related to your main point.  Hope this helps!",
    "base_reply": "I totally understand what you're going through! It can be frustrating when you're struggling to find the right words to express your thoughts. I've got some tips that might help you improve your verbal fluency and clarity:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Pay attention to how others communicate, especially people who are articulate and clear in their speech. Notice how they structure their thoughts, use transitions, and convey their message. This can help you develop your own effective communication style.\n2. **Mindfulness and meditation**: Regular mindfulness practice can improve your ability to focus and think more clearly. Meditation can help calm your mind, reducing mental chatter and allowing you to access your thoughts more easily. Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n3. **Write down your thoughts**: Writing can help you clarify your thoughts and organize your ideas. Try journaling, freewriting, or writing short essays on topics that interest you. This can help you develop your writing skills and improve your ability to articulate your thoughts.\n4. **Simplify and prioritize**: When you're speaking, try to focus on the main points you want to convey. Avoid adding unnecessary details or tangents, which can make your message unclear. Practice condensing complex ideas into concise, clear statements.\n5. **Pause and reflect**: Don't be afraid to pause when speaking or thinking. Take a moment to collect your thoughts, and then continue speaking. This can help you gather your ideas and express them more coherently.\n6. **Read widely and often**: Reading can indeed help improve your vocabulary, syntax, and overall communication skills. Expose yourself to different writing styles, genres, and authors to develop your understanding of language and its nuances.\n7. **Seek feedback**: Ask trusted friends, family, or colleagues for feedback on your communication style. They may be able to identify areas where you can improve and offer suggestions for growth.\n8. **Consider seeking professional help**: If you're struggling with persistent difficulties in verbalizing your thoughts or if you're experiencing anxiety or self-doubt related to communication, consider consulting a therapist or communication coach. They can help you identify patterns and develop strategies to improve your communication skills.\n\nAs for unnecessary detail, it's normal to add extra information when speaking, but being aware of this tendency can help you stay focused on the main points. Practice summarizing your thoughts and identifying the most important information to convey.\n\nOverthinking can indeed hinder your ability to communicate effectively. Try to focus on the present moment and the conversation at hand, rather than getting caught up in worries about what others might think or how you'll be perceived.\n\nRemember that developing your communication skills takes time and practice. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work on improving your verbal fluency and clarity."

    "base_reply": "Finding affordable flights can be a challenge, especially for frequent travelers like yourself! As a poor millennial, it's great that you're being mindful of your budget. Here are some tips to help you score a cheap flight:\n\n1. Be flexible with your travel dates: Prices vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year. Flying on off-peak days like Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays can often lead to cheaper fares.\n2. Use flight comparison tools: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines, airports, and dates. This can help you find the best deals.\n3. Set up price alerts: Many airlines and flight comparison tools offer price alerts. Set up notifications for your desired routes, and you'll receive an email when prices drop.\n4. Consider alternative airports: If you have multiple airport options, check prices for each to see if you can find a better deal.\n5. Book in advance: Generally, the earlier you book, the cheaper the fare. However, be aware that some airlines may increase prices as the flight approaches, so it's essential to monitor prices and adjust your booking accordingly.\n6. Look for error fares: Sometimes, airlines make mistakes and list flights at significantly lower prices. These error fares can be a great way to score a cheap flight, but be prepared to act fast, as they often don't last long.\n7. Consider budget airlines: If you're willing to fly with a budget airline and don't mind sacrificing some amenities, you can often find cheaper fares.\n8. Use your miles: If you have accumulated airline miles or credit card points, consider using them to book your flight or upgrade to a higher class.\n9. Avoid peak travel seasons: Flying during peak seasons like summer, holidays, or school breaks can result in higher prices. If possible, plan your trips during the off-season to save money.\n10. Consider a layover: Non-stop flights are often more expensive than flights with layovers. If you're not in a hurry, a layover might be a more affordable option.\n\nRemember, finding the cheapest flight is an ongoing process. Keep an eye on prices, be flexible, and be prepared to adjust your travel plans accordingly. Happy travels, and I hope you get to visit your family without breaking the bank!"

    "human": "By definition stoic means \"a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining.\"\n\nTo become stoic, one must have confidence in themselves so as to realize they will get through whatever hardships come their way. One must also realize that while people might help, there is a good chance one will be left to overcome their hardships by themselves. Being stoic doesn't happen overnight; You need to build extremely thick skin over time. The best advice I can give you if you're facing new hardships is simply power through. You can either power through and build that thick skin, or give up.",
    "base_reply": "Becoming more stoic takes time, effort, and self-awareness. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I'll offer you some practical advice to help you manage your anxiety and cultivate a more stoic mindset.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you're struggling with anxiety is a huge step forward. Recognize that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's not a sign of weakness. In fact, it's a sign that you're human.\n\nSince you're a med student, you're already familiar with the concept of resilience. Stoicism is built on the idea of accepting the things you can't control and focusing on what you can control. Here are some tips to help you develop a more stoic approach:\n\n1. **Mindfulness and self-awareness**: Practice mindfulness meditation, journaling, or simply taking a few deep breaths when you feel anxious. Recognize your physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts without judgment. This will help you become more aware of your triggers and develop a greater sense of control.\n2. **Reframe your thinking**: When you're feeling anxious, try to reframe your thoughts from \"I'm going to fail\" to \"I'll do my best, and that's all I can control.\" Focus on what you can do in the present moment, rather than worrying about the future or past.\n3. **Cultivate gratitude**: Reflect on the things you're grateful for each day, no matter how small they may seem. This can help shift your focus away from anxiety and cultivate a more positive mindset.\n4. **Build a support network**: Surround yourself with people who are supportive and understanding. Share your struggles with a trusted friend or mentor, and seek help when you need it.\n5. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Remember that failure is an inevitable part of the learning process, and it's how you respond to it that matters.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Be gentle with yourself, and avoid self-criticism.\n7. **Learn from others, but don't compare**: While it's great to learn from others in the field, don't compare yourself to them. Focus on your own growth and development, and recognize that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses.\n\nRegarding your concern about oncology, it's true that oncologists often face challenging situations. However, it's essential to remember that everyone has their own struggles, regardless of their profession. Instead of focusing on others' perceived competence or incompetence, focus on your own growth and development.\n\nRemember, becoming more stoic is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Start with small, achievable goals, and be patient with yourself. With time and practice, you'll develop greater resilience and a more stoic mindset.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of seeking help. Talk to your academic advisors, mentors, or a therapist if you need additional support. They can provide valuable guidance and help you develop strategies to manage your anxiety and achieve your goals."

Recognize that these emotions are valid and give yourself permission to feel them. Don't try to suppress or deny them, as this can lead to more emotional turmoil.\n2.

This will help you feel more empowered and less anxious.\n4. Set realistic expectations: Understand that you can't make everyone happy, nor should you try to. It's impossible to be the sole reason for someone's happiness. Instead, focus on being a good friend, partner, or family member by being reliable, supportive, and genuine.\n5. Develop a growth mindset: View challenges and disagreements as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of beating yourself up over perceived mistakes, use them as chances to improve and become a better person.\n6. Practice mindfulness and presence: When you start to ruminate on \"what ifs\" or \"should haves,\" gently bring your attention back to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, or the sensations in your body. This can help calm your mind and reduce worries about the past or future.\n7.

This helps the other person understand the scope of the ask and what they can expect in return.\n3. **Show your value**: Highlight your own strengths, skills, or accomplishments to demonstrate that you're not just asking for favors without giving back. This can help the other person feel like your ask is a fair exchange.\n4. **Consider a \"small ask\"**: Start with a relatively small or manageable task to test the waters and build trust. This can help you gauge the other person's willingness to help and avoid overwhelming them.\n5. **Be prepared to accept \"no\"**: Not everyone will be able to help, and that's okay! Be gracious and understanding if the other person declines, and don't take it personally.\n6. **Follow up and show appreciation**: If someone does agree to help, make sure to follow up and express your gratitude. This reinforces the idea that you value their time and effort.\n\nRemember, asking for help is a normal part of building relationships and growing as a person. It's okay to ask, and it's okay to receive help in return. Just be respectful, considerate, and clear in your ask, and you'll be more likely to get a positive response!"

That's a huge step forward! However, it's also important to recognize that being socially awkward doesn't necessarily mean you're not likable or deserving of friendships.\n\nRegarding your interactions with the girl you'd like to befriend, it's possible that she might not have seen your attempts to reach out as meaningful or significant enough to maintain contact. It's not uncommon for people to drift apart after a shared experience or a specific period, especially in college where everyone's schedules and priorities change frequently.\n\nAs for your group of friends, being seen as an \"orbiter\" can be frustrating, but it's also possible that they didn't realize they were treating you that way. It's essential to communicate openly and honestly with them about your feelings. Instead of accusing them of not valuing your friendship, try having a casual conversation about how you feel. You might say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed we haven't hung out as much lately, and I feel like I'm not as close to you guys as I'd like to be. Is everything okay? Is there something I can do to improve our friendship?\"\n\nTo move forward, consider the following:\n\n1. **Be more proactive in initiating conversations**: Instead of waiting for others to reach out, take the initiative to start conversations with the girl you'd like to befriend. Ask her about her interests, hobbies, or goals. This will show her that you're genuinely interested in getting to know her better.\n2. **Be clear about your intentions**: If you're interested in befriending someone, make it clear that your intentions are platonic. You can say something like, \"I really enjoy spending time with you, and I value our conversations. I was wondering if we could hang out again sometime, just the two of us, and get to know each other better.\"\n3. **Focus on shared interests**: Instead of trying to be friends with people who don't share your interests, find others who do. This will make it easier to build a connection and have meaningful conversations.\n4. **Practice self-care**: It's essential to prioritize your own well-being and not put too much pressure on yourself to fit in or make friends. Focus on your own hobbies, passions, and goals, and surround yourself with people who support and appreciate you for who you are.\n5. **Don't take it personally**: Rejection and setbacks are a natural part of life. Try not to take it personally and focus on the things you can control, like improving yourself and being a good friend to those who do value your relationships.\n\nRemember, building genuine friendships takes time, effort, and patience.

And rightly so, it can be expensive, especially if you're moving a lot of heavy or bulky items. However, if you have a lot of furniture, it might be the most convenient option.\n2. **Portable Storage Containers**: Companies like PODS, ABF U-Pack, or 1-800-PACK-RAT deliver a container to your current home, you load it up, and then they transport it to your new home. This option can be more cost-effective than a U-Haul, but you'll still need to do the heavy lifting.\n3. **Hire Professional Movers**: If you're short on time or energy, you can hire professional movers to handle the heavy lifting. This will likely be the most expensive option, but it's a good choice if you have a lot of fragile or heavy items.\n4. **Sell or Donate Unwanted Items**: This is a great opportunity to declutter and get rid of items you no longer need or want. You can sell items online through platforms like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or local garage sales. Donate items to charity and claim a tax deduction.\n5. **Ship Small Items**: For smaller items like books, clothes, or kitchenware, consider shipping them via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. This can be a cost-effective option, especially if you're moving a small number of items.\n6. **Ask Friends or Family for Help**: If you have friends or family members with a truck or SUV, ask if they'd be willing to help you move some of your items. This can be a great way to save money and build relationships.\n7. **Local Moving Companies**: Research local moving companies in your area that offer affordable rates and services. They might be able to provide a more personalized and cost-effective solution.\n\nBefore making a decision, consider the following factors:\n\n* Distance: How far are you moving? The farther you're going, the more you might need to consider the cost of fuel, tolls, and potential traffic delays.\n* Weight and size: How much weight and space do you have to fill? This will impact the cost of your chosen option.\n* Time: How much time do you have available for the move? If you're short on time, you might need to prioritize convenience over cost.\n* Budget: What's your budget for the move? Be realistic about what you can afford, and prioritize accordingly.\n\nTake your time to weigh the pros and cons of each option. You might also consider a combination of methods, like shipping small items and hiring professionals for larger or heavier items. Remember to stay organized, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Good luck with your move!"

Let's break it down.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not just considering a temporary move, but a decision that will impact your life's trajectory. You're right to prioritize your well-being and consider the long-term implications of each choice.\n\nGiven your circumstances, it's clear that you have a strong connection to New Jersey, having grown up there and having a sense of familiarity with the area. You also have a social network and know what to expect from the lifestyle. On the other hand, Eugene presents an opportunity for a fresh start, a chance to experience a new place, and a unique chance to explore the outdoors.\n\nConsidering your personal life, it's understandable that you're torn between staying in New Jersey and being close to your love interest, despite the rocky relationship. It's essential to acknowledge that your decision should prioritize your own growth and happiness, rather than trying to force a situation that's not working.\n\nHere's a suggestion: take some time to reflect on what you truly want from this gap year. What are your priorities? Do you want to focus on personal growth, explore a new place, or maintain a sense of stability? Are there any specific aspects of Eugene or New Jersey that excite or concern you?\n\nUltimately, you should weigh the pros and cons of each option, considering factors like:\n\n* Your personal growth and development\n* Your relationships (including the one with your love interest)\n* Your career goals and opportunities\n* Your overall well-being and happiness\n\nTake your time, and don't rush into a decision. Remember that you can always re-evaluate and adjust as needed. Good luck, and I hope you find the right path forward!"

I've seen him get aggravated with work stuff- venting after a long day, annoyed by a text or email that would come through- but nothing out of the ordinary. Other than that he always seems very chill and laid back. \n\nHe has a pretty high stress job and has quite a few people who work under him. Yesterday we were spending the day together and he got a call about work and was so aggressive with whoever was on the other end. Like answered the phone with \"why the fuck are you calling me?\" The call only lasted a couple minutes, most of it spent with my boyfriend berating whoever he was talking to. \n\nAfter he hung up he went completely back to normal. He just apologized and acted like nothing happened. I feel like I got whiplash. I asked him what the hell that was all about and he apologized again and just said that's how he has to be with work stuff and it's part of the job. For the record he is in a weird industry that I don't know much about so that might be the case? \n\nI don't know it just really threw me off. I'm not sure what to think. Is it normal for people to be so Jekyll/ Hyde with work? Do I try to talk to him again? He just kept brushing it off saying that's just how his work is.

The fact that your boyfriend didn't seem to care that much about how he came across or that he brushed it off so easily is concerning.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily say that this is a definitive red flag, but it's definitely a yellow flag that warrants further exploration. Here are some potential red flags to keep an eye out for:\n\n1. Lack of empathy: If your boyfriend doesn't seem to care about how his behavior affects others or doesn't take responsibility for his actions, it might be a sign of a deeper issue.\n2. Pattern of aggression: If this is not an isolated incident and you notice a pattern of aggressive behavior towards others, including you, it's essential to address it.\n3. Difficulty with conflict resolution: If your boyfriend has trouble apologizing sincerely or making amends when he's wronged someone, it could be a sign of a deeper issue with conflict resolution.\n4. Work-life balance: If his work stress is affecting his personal life and relationships, it might be a sign that he needs to re-evaluate his priorities or find better coping mechanisms.\n\nBefore bringing it up again, take some time to process your feelings and gather your thoughts. When you do talk to him, try to approach the conversation calmly and non-accusatorily. You might ask him:\n\n* How he's managing his stress and emotions at work\n* If he's feeling overwhelmed or unsupported by his employer or colleagues\n* If he's aware of the impact his behavior has on those around him\n* If he's willing to work on improving his communication and conflict resolution skills\n\nRemember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries if necessary.

For the purpose of keeping it anonymous, I’ll change everyone’s name, too. \n\nMy best friend of 3 years (21 F, Jane) has had an on-again-off-again fling with my brother (22 M, Duke) for 2 years now. I love them together, but wouldn’t be upset with either of them if nothing ever came of it.\n\nMe and Jane’s other best friend of 1 year (22 F, Stacy) hadn’t had the chance to meet Duke until recently. Stacy is the kind of person who speaks her mind and doesn’t hold back, but Jane and I were convinced Stacy would like my brother. \n\nWe all went to a bar together and we were having a great time. We all were definitely a little drunk, and when my brother Duke gets drunk, his quirkier side comes out, which obviously myself and Jane are used to. But then out of nowhere, Stacy pulled Jane aside and told her that Duke was a total weirdo, not good looking, and that she could do much better. Then Stacy went as far as to say she hates Duke, thinks he is autistic and continued to ask Jane if he has mental problems.\n\nI overheard this and was immediately offended she would say that about my brother, especially within the first 3 hours of meeting him. Jane also got very upset that our best friend would be so quick to judge someone that her and I obviously care about so much. \n\nI kind of let it blow over for the night because I didn’t want to say anything to Stacy that I would regret since I was drunk, but it was obviously still bothering me a lot.\n\nJane and I went to lunch 2 days later at the restaurant Stacy works at, and Jane brought it up to me about how much it bothered her and how she feels ashamed for being so interested in my brother when our best friend said she hates him and thinks he’s autistic. I told her I understood how Stacy’s words could influence how she thinks because it hurts to hear that one of your best friends doesn’t like the person you’re interested in.\n\nI also explained to Jane that I was very offended that she said these things thinking I didn’t hear them in that moment, and that I would never find out. \n\nWe agreed that it would be best for us to talk to Stacy about this and that we would at a later time, but then when I got up to use the restroom, Stacy brought it up to Jane while I wasn’t there to reiterate how much she hated Duke and how she thinks he has mental problems based on how he acted while he was drunk. \n\nJane got very upset by this, and when I got back we paid the check and left immediately, which is when I was filled in on what had happened. \n\nI know now that I really have to bring it up to Stacy, but I have no idea how to do it or what to even say. From what I’m gathering, she believes that she’s done nothing wrong.\n\nI’ve also realized that without an apology, this is something I would consider ending our friendship over. \n\nI’d like to know if there’s anything I could be interpreting wrong, but if I’m not, what should I say to Stacy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR! My best friend (22 F) met my brother (22 M) for the first time and said that she hated him and that she thinks he is autistic. How should I handle this?",
    "human": "So Stacey is ableist and unpleasant. I would *definitely* end a \"friendship\" over that kind of thing. (Of course, I'm personally autistic, to the surprise of most people who don't know me very well. So being friends with someone who conflates that with something bad is kind of right out because they're going to constantly see me in a bad light 🤷‍♀️)",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a tough situation! It's understandable that you're feeling upset and unsure about how to approach this with Stacy. Before we dive into what to say to her, let's break down what's happening here. It seems like Stacy has made some hurtful and potentially harmful comments about your brother, and it's affecting your friendship.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that Stacy's words can be damaging, especially considering your brother's character and your relationship with him. It's not okay for someone to make assumptions about someone's mental health or abilities based on a brief interaction.\n\nNow, when it comes to addressing this with Stacy, it's crucial to approach the conversation calmly and assertively. Here's a suggested script:\n\n1. Start by expressing your feelings: \"Hey Stacy, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation the other day when you met Duke. I have to be honest, I was really hurt by what you said about him. It felt like you were judging him without giving him a chance.\"\n2. Focus on the impact of her words: \"I know you might not have intended to hurt anyone, but your words had a significant impact on me and Jane. We care deeply about Duke, and it's hard to hear someone we trust say such negative things about him.\"\n3. Avoid blaming or attacking: \"I'm not asking you to like Duke or agree with him, but I do expect you to respect our feelings and opinions. It would mean a lot to us if you could be more considerate in the future.\"\n4. Encourage empathy: \"I know you might have had a different experience, but I want you to imagine how you would feel if someone said those things about someone you care about. It's essential to be kind and understanding, even when we don't agree.\"\n5. Set boundaries: \"Going forward, I'd appreciate it if we could avoid discussing Duke in a negative light. It's not worth hurting our friendship over, but I do need to feel respected and understood.\"\n\nRemember to listen to Stacy's perspective as well, and try to understand where she's coming from. However, it's essential to prioritize your own feelings and boundaries in this situation.\n\nBefore you have this conversation, take a moment to gather your thoughts and emotions. You might want to practice what you'll say with a trusted friend or family member to feel more confident. Remember, you're not trying to attack Stacy, but rather express your feelings and needs.\n\nLastly, if Stacy doesn't apologize or show remorse, it might be a sign that your friendship is not as strong as you thought. You deserve to be surrounded by people who respect and care about your feelings."

Where are you going?\" \n\nI had no idea what she was talking about, and I assumed that she must have misheard me.

It's exhausting and frustrating!\n\nFirst, let's tackle the root cause: your anxiety. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about it? They can help you identify the triggers and develop coping mechanisms. In the meantime, here's a temporary solution:\n\nWhen you start to feel that anxiety creeping in, take a few deep breaths and acknowledge the thought. Don't try to suppress it or avoid it, but rather, say to yourself, \"Ah, I'm feeling anxious again. This is just my brain being paranoid.\" Recognize that it's not a reflection of your worth or actions.\n\nNow, let's work on the physical aspect. When you catch yourself going red, try to relax your facial muscles. Take a slow, deep breath in, and as you exhale, release any tension in your face. You can also try to subtly relax your shoulders and arms – often, our entire body tenses up when we're anxious.\n\nIn terms of the specific scenarios you mentioned, here's a strategy:\n\nFor \"Where has this item gone?\" or \"Where have you been?\", try to respond calmly and confidently. Instead of apologizing or making excuses, say something like, \"I'm not sure, let me take a look\" or \"I was actually [insert honest answer].\"\n\nRemember, honesty is usually the best policy. If you're genuinely unsure or can't remember, it's okay to say so. People are more likely to understand and appreciate your transparency.\n\nLastly, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of worrying about what others might think, focus on being authentic and kind. Your true self is way more attractive than any guilty look!\n\nHow do you feel about trying these strategies?"

Here are some tips to help you maintain your professional boundaries while preserving your friendships:\n\n1. **Set clear expectations upfront**: When discussing a project or gig with a friend, be specific about what you're willing to do and what you're not. This can help avoid misunderstandings and set the tone for a successful collaboration.\n2. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you're asking too much,\" say \"I'm feeling overwhelmed with this scope, can we discuss ways to adjust the project to make it more manageable for me?\" This approach focuses on your own feelings and needs, rather than attacking the other person.\n3. **Establish a contract or agreement**: Consider creating a simple contract or agreement outlining the scope of work, payment terms, and expectations. This can help clarify responsibilities and prevent misunderstandings. You can use online templates or create your own.\n4. **Communicate proactively**: If you're feeling overwhelmed or concerned about a project, address the issue early on. Don't wait until it's too late or the relationship is strained. Open and honest communication can go a long way in preventing conflicts.\n5. **Be firm but polite**: When negotiating boundaries or adjusting scope, be assertive but respectful. Remember that you're not being confrontational, you're simply setting clear expectations. Use phrases like \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to prioritize my workload. Can we adjust the project to focus on the most important tasks?\"\n6. **Don't be afraid to say no**: It's okay to decline a project or request if it doesn't align with your goals, values, or workload. You can say something like, \"I appreciate the opportunity, but I need to prioritize my current commitments. Perhaps we can discuss future collaborations when my schedule opens up?\"\n7. **Maintain a professional distance**: While it's essential to be friendly and approachable, remember that you're working with friends, not personal acquaintances. Keep the business aspect separate from your personal relationships to avoid blurring the lines.\n8. **Re-evaluate the friendship**: If you find that you're consistently feeling taken advantage of or stressed by working with a particular friend, it may be time to re-evaluate the friendship. Prioritize your own well-being and consider setting boundaries or distancing yourself from the friendship if necessary.\n\nRemember, setting boundaries is not about being difficult or uncooperative; it's about being respectful of your own time, energy, and professional reputation.

It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you're acknowledging it and seeking help.\n\nI've worked with many people who've struggled with work-related anxiety, and I'm happy to share some insights and tips that might help.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that anxiety is often a sign that there's something underlying that needs attention. It's not just about the job itself, but how you're feeling about it. Have you noticed any changes in your work environment, workload, or personal life that might be contributing to your anxiety?\n\nOne possible reason for your increased anxiety could be the pressure to constantly adapt to new technologies, processes, or expectations. IT is a rapidly evolving field, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed by the pace of change. Perhaps you're feeling like you're constantly playing catch-up or struggling to keep up with the demands of your job.\n\nAnother possibility is that you're experiencing burnout. Are you getting enough sleep, exercise, and time off? Are you taking breaks during the workday, or are you consistently working long hours without a break? Burnout can manifest as anxiety, fatigue, and decreased motivation.\n\nHere are some tips that might help alleviate your anxiety:\n\n1. **Communicate with your team and manager**: Talk to your colleagues and supervisor about your concerns. They might be able to offer support, help you prioritize tasks, or provide guidance on managing your workload.\n2. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation outside of work. This could be exercise, hobbies, reading, or spending time with loved ones. Schedule self-care into your daily routine, just as you would any other important task.\n3. **Re-evaluate your workload**: Take a closer look at your tasks and responsibilities. Are there any areas where you can delegate or ask for help? Are there any tasks that can be eliminated or adjusted to reduce your workload?\n4. **Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques**: Regular mindfulness exercises, meditation, or deep breathing can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. You can find many free resources online, such as guided meditations or apps like Headspace or Calm.\n5. **Seek professional help**: If your anxiety persists, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can help you identify underlying issues and develop coping strategies tailored to your specific situation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help, and it's a sign of strength, not weakness. By addressing the root causes of your anxiety and implementing these tips, you can regain control and find a more balanced and fulfilling work-life experience.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions?

If you're not comfortable intervening, it's okay to take a step back and let the friends work it out on their own (while still being supportive from a distance).\n\nThat being said, if you do want to try to intervene, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Stay calm and neutral**: Take a few deep breaths, count to 10, or step away for a sec to collect your thoughts before jumping into the situation. Avoid getting drawn into the argument or taking sides.\n2. **Acknowledge the emotions**: Sometimes, people just need to be heard and validated. You can say something like, \"I can see that you're really upset about this\" or \"I can tell this is bothering you.\" This helps the other person feel understood and can help diffuse the tension.\n3. **Encourage active listening**: Suggest that both parties take a break and revisit the conversation when they're feeling calmer. You can say, \"Hey, let's take a break and come back to this when we're all feeling more relaxed. Can we agree to listen to each other without interrupting?\"\n4. **Redirect the conversation**: If the argument is getting too heated, try to steer the conversation towards a more positive or neutral topic. You could say, \"Hey, let's talk about something else.

This can escalate the situation further. Instead, focus on the issue at hand and try to help the friends find a resolution.\n6. **Know when to step back**: If the argument is getting too intense or personal, it might be best to excuse yourself and let the friends work it out on their own. You can say, \"I think I'm going to step out for a bit and let you guys work this out. I'm here if you need me.\"\n\nRemember, it's okay if you don't always succeed in defusing the situation. The goal is to try to help, not to fix the argument or take sides. By staying calm, empathetic, and neutral, you can help create a safe space for your friends to work through their differences and potentially resolve the issue."

I think everyone who knows how many differences in opinions, viewpoints, life experiences, hobbies of choice, etc. realizes that, but she seems to be in denial.\n\nWe have to have so many of the same conversations repeatedly because we're so different and it's so difficult for us to coexist on the same wavelength of day-to-day life without frustrating one another. We also live together, so that not only makes it hard to break up, but makes it so that there's constant friction because we're so different.\n\nI'm also not very attracted to her, and this is really my fault. I know I might get a lot of criticism for this, but I'm not very into her physically, and I wasn't when we first met. The reason I pursued the relationship is because I was (and still am) in love with her personality and how much fun and how good of a person  she is-- I was hoping I'd become more physically attracted to her over time (which I've had happen with other women), but it never did after a year and a half.\n\nLike I mentioned, she's a really nice person; she's unselfish, thinks of others first (to a fault sometimes), and generally hasn't really done anything wrong to a major degree in the relationship. We all make mistakes in relationships, but it's not like she's abusive or selfish or anything like that.\n\nI can't stand the thought of breaking her heart. I tried to break up with her a few months ago because, same as now, I just felt like we're not a good match. She got very emotional, almost begged me not to break up, and I felt so guilty that I went back on it.\n\nBut now I'm realizing that this just can't work. It can't. But I don't know how to end it without both of us being severely emotional damaged (her more so than me). How can I do it?

    "human": "I don't quite know where people get the idea that they can only end a relationship under certain extreme circumstances.

It's not easy to admit when something isn't right, especially when there's an emotional investment.\n\nSince you've already tried to break up with her once and didn't follow through, I think it's essential to have a clear plan this time around.

You see, couples therapy is designed to help the couple work through their issues and strengthen their relationship. In your case, the issues are fundamental and might not be resolvable.\n\nInstead, consider having a calm, honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. Be prepared to listen to her perspective as well, but also be firm in your conviction that you're not compatible. You can say something like:\n\n\"[Her name], I wanted to talk to you about us. I've been thinking a lot about our relationship, and I've come to realize that I don't think we're a good match.

Be prepared for her to be upset, and have a plan in place for how you'll support her during this difficult time. You can offer to help her find a place to stay or connect her with friends or family who can provide support.\n\nLastly, remember that it's not your fault if this relationship doesn't work out.

    "sentence": "I (F33) snooped in my partner's (M40) things and found something I wasn't expecting. 2ish year relationship. Let me just preface this by saying I already know it was wrong to snoop so I'm not looking for someone to tell me that. I'm struggling with trust issues. I recently found some  social media comments that straight up entailed he was arranging to meet up for sex. He denied it flat out and said he was just using it for masturbation purposes. I may never find out the truth but I'm still uneasy about it and question if I can trust him.\n\nIt was a moment of weakness. I was grasping at straws for some kind of answers or proof. I walked past his drawer and opened it. I didn't find proof of cheating but what I did find was crystal meth. He has been open about recreational drug use in the past but NOT about meth. I thought maybe he just had some to sell but in addition found a glass pipe that looked used. He has a lot of energy and stays up all hours of the night sometimes, so it'd make sense if he was using but I never had any other reason to think he was. Except for about a year ago I found the same looking glass pipe in the house, sent him a pic and he said just throw it away. I'm sort of a novice on drug paraphernalia so I didn't think a whole lot of it and didn't ask any further but in hindsight feel like I shouldve. I wasn't snooping at that time, it was in our kitchen. I'm okay with some rec drug use but meth seems hardcore...\n\nNow I feel like a complete a-hole for snooping and crossing a line I shouldn't have crossed. But also finding the meth is quite concerning. Is this not what I think? Am I overreacting? Ultimately I know I'll have to admit to snooping but is it worth it to confront him to find out it's not what I think, and then I betrayed his trust for something dumb? Should i just keep the info I have in the back of my mind and let it play out and see if anything else comes up? Should I somehow bring up meth use and see if he'll admit to it before I confirm what I found?\n\nTLDR I snooped in my boyfriend's stuff and found meth and had no knowledge he'd ever even done it. I crossed a line I shouldn't have by snooping. How do I bring this up to him? I'm concerned but want to make sure I'm not overreacting before I confront him.",
    "human": "If it were me I would just say \"I know you're doing meth, I'm not ok with that. It's over.\" You DO NOT want to be with a meth addict. As someone else pointed out, they tend to be hyper sexual and in my experience very untrustworthy. I second the idea to get tested. I wouldn't even feel bad about snooping or even mention it. Just get out of the relationship.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. First, please know that you're not alone, and it's understandable that you're struggling with trust issues. It takes a lot of courage to admit your mistake and seek guidance.\n\nNow, let's break down your concerns. You've found something that's deeply concerning, and it's natural to feel uneasy. However, it's essential to separate your feelings from the facts. You've already acknowledged that snooping was wrong, and that's a crucial step. Now, you need to decide how to approach the situation.\n\nBefore you confront your partner, take some time to reflect on what you want to achieve from this conversation. Are you looking for honesty, accountability, or a deeper understanding of his actions? Be clear about your goals, as this will help you navigate the conversation.\n\nConsidering you've already snooped, it's essential to acknowledge your actions and take responsibility. Apologize for crossing the line and express your concerns about the methamphetamine. Use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel, avoiding accusatory language. For example: \"I'm worried about your well-being, and I'm concerned about the potential risks associated with methamphetamine use. I want to understand what's going on and how we can work together to address this.\"\n\nIt's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and an open mind. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. You may not get the truth, but you can try to understand his perspective and encourage him to be honest.\n\nIf you do decide to confront him, prepare for a range of outcomes. He might deny everything, admit to using, or be evasive. Be prepared to listen actively and respond thoughtfully.\n\nLastly, consider seeking professional help or support from a trusted friend or family member. Dealing with these kinds of issues can be overwhelming, and having a support system can be incredibly helpful.\n\nRemember, you're not overreacting; you're taking a step towards addressing your concerns and potentially improving your relationship. Take your time, be honest with yourself, and prioritize your own well-being throughout this process."

    "sentence": "TL;DR; My wife had sex with someone she met in a store. Wants to maintain a friendship with both me and the person she cheated on me with.\n\nMy wife of five years cheated by sleeping with a stranger she met in a store. They exchanged numbers, spoke, had drinks, and she took him to her hotel room and had sex with him. She confessed everything to me and firmly admits that the story, as crazy as it sounds, is true. Our marriage had been pretty shaky and this was the reason for her taking a break and booking a hotel room in the first place. She went out on the town and this is where she met the stranger.\n\nWe still love and care about each other however and it would be nice for us to remain friends. Is this healthy?\n\nSecondly, she stayed in touch with the person she had sex with after their encounter and she has developed a strong connection and liking with this person even though she has only known this person for three weeks. She refers to it as \"love at first sight\". She claims to still love me. She has since moved out and now has her own place. I told her that if we were to remain friends in any capacity, then you can't remain in a relationship or in open communication with the person that you've cheated on me with. She's finding this to be a difficult ask because she does not want to lose our friendship but also has somehow developed a deep connection with her three-week old dealings with her \\*male equivalent of mistress\\*. Is this a reasonable request?\n\n  \nEDIT:  Thank you guys for the kind and *not-so-kind* words. I appreciate all the advice. I will seek out a therapist to get through this as it is indeed a painful moment in my life. I guess deep down I know none of this was a good idea but maybe I was \"*shock by her admission and further fricking audacious actions*\" coupled with the reality of the last 5 years of building, traveling, fun &amp; happy times, and my once best friend in life and first true love all coming to an end. I am definitely allowing my emotions to hold me hostage here. The friendship obviously would not benefit me in any resourceful way but I can see how it would benefit her in many ways. A *security blanket as* someone put it.\n\nI also agree that at this point I cannot dictate who she sees or befriends. Knowing that she still wanted some kind of relationship with the guy that she cheated on me with I should have simply declined the mere notion of us being friends.\n\n**TO THOSE SEEKING MORE DETAILS.**\n\nNo we don't have kids.\n\nI have pressed her on the \"met at a store\" story several times but she doubles down on it. Says she understands that the behavior was unsafe and unhealthy but she was in a vulnerable place - due to the marital funk - when she first met the guy and accepted his number and his request to have drinks. Also blames some of her actions on alcohol.\n\nThis woman came into my life when I was in a dark place myself. She is a big reason why I am the person I am today as she's helped build me up in many ways. So it seems to me that one of the reasons why I still wanted to be there for her after what happened was probably to show gratitude. As some has pointed out it probably has to do with not having better self-esteem as well. I'm also aware that she can have suicidal thoughts and speak in really dark terms when she goes through situations like this and she has during this process especially when she thought she was going to be homeless, etc. But I am coming to the realization that the same way I must now seek help to better myself, so does she. She cannot expect me to care more for her than she does for herself. Especially in a moment like this I must prioritize myself and my mental health if I am to move past this.\n\nThroughout the years we've had some marital issues. Typically in the form of verbal abuse on both ends. When arguments occur, some pretty horrible things get said both by me and by her. We tried to change this but it didn't seem to be working out. She claims that this is what drove her to do what she did. The \"*break*\" in question was not a separation. We were having discussions on whether we should call it quits or not after our last big fight. She then said that she needs space for herself and this is when she went out of town for a couple days. She even asked me to join her on the first day/night which I did. The next day is when the situation happened with the 'stranger'.\n\nI still cannot make sense of all of it. Some of it definitely seems made up and like she's lying. Others just seem like pretty irrational behavior of which she's blaming on things that I've said in arguments. Whether it was planned or not. OR done out of anger it's blatantly disrespectful no matter how you look at it. If we were to end things. Fine, let's do that first then pursue your rendezvous.\n\nAs much as it still hurts and as painful as all of this is, I am now filing for divorce, I stopped all contact with her (*except for how to distribute our assets*), and I'll be getting a therapist.\n\nThank you for your time, words, encouragement and advice. It has helped me gain some clarity on things I was in obvious denial about.\n\nTL;DR I'm filing for divorce on the ground of infidelity, we've halted contact and minimal communication and I'll be seeing a therapist soon.",

    "sentence": "Hey, this is literally my first post here, I made this account just to talk about this because I feel like I cant go to anyone else without being judged and told im absolutely crazy. Anyway, I (21F) and my bf (20M) have been together for 6 and almost a half years, which means we got together very very very young. We've experienced most first things together like travelling, getting drunk, and sex (obviously\\`). However, we didn't initiate our sex life until 2.5 years into our relationship (because as I've said, we were really young), which was cute but also created problems in the long run. We basically have no sexual chemistry, because our relationship was never sexual. This resulted in a lot of awkward moments, weird conversations and unsuccessful sex. Once we became adults we began to talk about it more, which improved our sex life slightly, but we're still not compatible. My bf starts talking about some kinks he has and refers to them as being nasty and being ashamed of himself. This made me panic slightly because what on earth could be so terrible? He's always been the most vanilla person in bed so I was clueless. After some deep talks I came to realise he was into BDSM and being submissive. I was so relieved. This is a very common kink and very doable from my part, really.\n\nNow, here's where things start going downhill. Our sex life hasn't changed despite me now knowing what he likes, because he refuses to act on it, almost like he's hiding this part of himself. I've asked to sext multiple times and he always says no, because it makes him awkward and uncomfortable. We also don't exchange pictures or videos for the same reasons. I would rather we did, but obviously I respect him so I never push it. Last night, however, and for the third time in this relationship, I've caught sexual messages between him and other women. He's literally starting the conversation by asking them to step on his throat. The conversations are never long (max of 5 messages exchanged), they never show any intent of meeting up and being physical, and they are only exchanged during the down periods of our relationship. So, I confronted him.\n\nHe admitted to it \\`(for the third time) and his reasonings are always the same: \"I can't be like this with you because, even though i'm sexually attracted to you and I have these kinks, I don't want you to see me in such a degrading and submissive manner, I don't want you to get icky and disgusted\" and \"I do this when things are bad in the relationship as an escape. I feel stuck and this makes me feel free and I can be my truest self\". He also says he goes for women he doesn't know because he doesn't care about their opinion, even if they think he's disgusting or a pervert. And this is where the problem lays. Because I completely understand where he's coming from and I understand why he'd behave like that. Im the cute type of girl, I can see why he's feel judged and awkward to ask me to step on his throat. I don't think he intends to hurt me, I think he resorts to his \"dark side\" when he's trapped and he's ashamed on showing me that. I just don't know what to do. I've reassured him the last 2 times this happened. I told him I wouldn't think bad of him because I'd like to explore that sexual side too. But it's clearly useless.\n\nIf I stay once again, I give him a green card to keep cheating and I'll become paranoid and insecure. If I leave, I'll leave behind my best friend and the person Ive always loved. He's an insanely good person, with a pure heart.\n\nIm lost.

That takes a lot of empathy and maturity.\n\nHowever, I have to be blunt: his behavior is not okay. Sexting other women, even if it's just for a \"release\" or an \"escape,\" is a form of emotional infidelity. It's a betrayal of trust, and it's a clear sign that he's not committed to working on his issues or communicating openly with you.\n\nIt's understandable that you're torn between staying and leaving.

Different people have different levels of comfort with intimacy, that doesn’t mean it’s bad. \n\nThat said, talk to her! Make it clear that you’re starting to wonder if there’s a reason for the lack of intimacy other than her not feeling comfortable (which btw is a perfectly valid reason) and ask her what she thinks of being more intimate. What is she comfortable with? Is kissing on the table? The occasional cuddle? Are there certain times where touch is off limits (when I’m anxious I just want a hug, but I know others who can’t bear to be touched when they’re under stress). It could be that she doesn’t know how to broach the subject with you, since you also don’t go out of your way to initiate, if I read your comments about not being touchy-feely correctly. \n\nYes, it might be that she’s not attracted to you, at which point you will have to decide if you want to move on. But it could also be maybe she cares about you but isn’t into sex! Or is scared of initiating for some other reason! Be patient, talk to her, build trust through open communication. You can’t make a good decision until you have all the facts.",
    "base_reply": "I get it. It can be tough to navigate these kinds of situations. First, let's break it down: your friends' reaction was probably a mix of joking and genuine curiosity, but it's understandable that you're feeling self-conscious about it. Now, let's address the elephant in the room - the fact that you're 5 months in and haven't kissed yet.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to take their time in relationships, and it's great that you're respecting her boundaries. However, it's natural to wonder if she's attracted to you or if there's something holding her back. The key here is to focus on your own feelings and actions, rather than overthinking hers.\n\nSince you mentioned you're not a touchy-feely person, it might be helpful to find ways to show affection in ways that feel more natural to you, like holding hands or giving gentle hugs. This can help build intimacy and closeness without feeling too overwhelming.\n\nAs for when to ask to kiss her, it's a good idea to wait for a natural moment that feels right. You could try paying attention to moments when you're both relaxed and comfortable with each other, like during a quiet evening at home or a romantic outing. When you feel the time is right, you can try initiating a gentle, casual kiss, and see how she responds.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and focus on building a strong emotional connection with your girlfriend. Don't put too much pressure on the physical aspect, and try not to overanalyze her feelings. Just be yourself, be respectful, and let things unfold naturally."

Let's break it down together.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to develop strong feelings for someone you've known for years, especially when you share a deep connection. It's not just about physical attraction; it's about the emotional resonance you've found with this person.\n\nGiven that she's already set on someone else and they're going on a date, it's crucial to prioritize her feelings and boundaries. You need to consider the possibility that she might not feel the same way about you, and even if she does, it's essential to respect her current commitment.\n\nBefore taking any action, take some time to reflect on your motivations. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you truly in love with her, or are you infatuated with the idea of being with someone who shares your interests and personality?\n2. Have you been ignoring any red flags or warning signs in your relationship with her, and are you prepared to confront those issues if she doesn't reciprocate your feelings?\n3. Are you prepared for the possibility that she might not feel the same way, and are you willing to accept that outcome?\n\nIf you've answered these questions honestly and still feel that you're genuinely in love with her, here's what you can do:\n\n1. Take a step back and focus on yourself. Use this time to work on your own personal growth, hobbies, and interests. This will help you develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment outside of your feelings for her.\n2. Respect her boundaries and don't try to sabotage her relationship with the other guy. It's not fair to her, and it's not a healthy way to handle your emotions.\n3. When you're ready, have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Be prepared for any outcome, and don't pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize her well-being and your own emotional safety in this situation. Don't rush into anything that might lead to hurt or regret.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's okay to acknowledge your feelings and explore them, even if they're unrequited. You can still grow and learn from this experience, and who knows, it might lead you to a deeper understanding of yourself and what you want in a relationship."

    "base_reply": "I love your self-awareness and willingness to acknowledge your struggles! Loosening up and becoming less high-strung takes time, effort, and a willingness to challenge your thought patterns. I'm happy to share some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Recognize and challenge your thoughts**: When you feel yourself getting worked up over something, take a step back and examine your thoughts. Ask yourself, \"Is this really worth getting upset over?\" or \"Is this a reasonable expectation?\" Challenge those thoughts by reframing them in a more realistic or humorous light. For example, instead of thinking \"My roommate is being rude,\" try \"My roommate is just having fun, and I can choose to let it bother me or not.\"\n2. **Practice mindfulness and presence**: Mindfulness meditation can help you stay present in the moment and reduce worries about the past or future. You can start with short exercises like focusing on your breath, body sensations, or the five senses. You can also try mindful walking, yoga, or other physical activities that help you stay grounded.\n3. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace the idea that it's okay to be late sometimes. Remember that it's not the end of the world, and it's a normal part of life. Instead of beating yourself up over it, focus on what you can control – like adjusting your schedule or planning ahead.\n4. **Set realistic expectations**: Recognize that you can't control everything, and it's okay to let go of the need for perfection. Prioritize what's truly important to you and let go of the rest. For example, if being on time is crucial for you, focus on planning ahead and building buffer time, rather than getting frustrated when things don't go exactly as planned.\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. When you make mistakes or get upset, acknowledge your emotions and remind yourself that it's okay to feel that way. Practice self-care and self-compassion to help you develop a more relaxed attitude towards life's imperfections.\n6. **Find healthy outlets**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you release tension, such as exercise, creative pursuits, or spending time in nature. This can help you develop a more positive and relaxed state of mind.\n7. **Reframe your sense of humor**: Instead of using humor to deflect or criticize others, try to find the humor in your own struggles and imperfections. This can help you develop a more lighthearted and playful approach to life.\n8. **Seek support**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend or therapist who can offer guidance, support, and new perspectives. Having someone to talk to can help you feel less isolated and more empowered to make changes.\n\nRemember, becoming more relaxed and chilled out is a journey that takes time, patience, and practice. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With time and effort, you can develop a more laid-back and compassionate approach to life."

Stopping it takes awareness, practice, and a willingness to rewire your responses. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you overcome snarkiness:\n\n1. **Recognize your triggers**: Reflect on when and why you tend to be snarky. Is it when you're feeling overwhelmed, tired, or frustrated? Identify your emotional cues, and try to address the root causes. Practice stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or a quick walk to calm down.\n2. **Pause before responding**: When someone says something that might trigger your snarky response, take a deep breath and count to 10 (or 20, or 30...). This simple pause can help you reframe your response and choose a more constructive one.\n3. **Practice active listening**: Make an effort to truly hear what the other person is saying, without interrupting or mentally preparing your response. Repeat back what you've understood from their words, and ask clarifying questions to ensure you're on the same page. This helps you focus on the conversation, rather than reacting impulsively.\n4. **Reframe your mindset**: Instead of seeing snarky comments as a way to \"win\" an argument or prove a point, try to view them as a way to build connection and understanding. Remember that the goal of conversation is to exchange ideas, not to \"win\" or \"lose.\"\n5. **Find the humor**: When you do catch yourself about to say something snarky, try to reframe it as a joke or a lighthearted remark. This can help you shift your tone and create a more playful atmosphere.\n6. **Practice empathy and understanding**: Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to see things from their perspective. Ask yourself, \"What's driving their thoughts and feelings?\" or \"What's behind their words?\" This can help you respond with compassion and understanding, rather than defensiveness.\n7. **Develop a growth mindset**: Recognize that everyone has flaws and imperfections. When you respond with kindness and understanding, you're more likely to create a positive and supportive environment.\n8. **Seek feedback and self-reflection**: Ask trusted friends or loved ones if they've noticed your snarkiness and how it affects them. Be open to constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity to grow.\n9. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate each time you catch yourself refraining from a snarky comment or responding in a more constructive way. This will help reinforce positive habits and motivation.\n10. **Be patient and persistent**: Changing habits takes time and effort. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – simply acknowledge the mistake and try again.\n\nRemember, overcoming snarkiness is a process that requires self-awareness, practice, and patience. With time and effort, you can develop a more constructive communication style that fosters meaningful connections and positive relationships."

Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks to make progress.\n2. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most important tasks that align with your goals. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent vs. Important. Focus on the most critical tasks first, and delegate or defer less important ones.\n3. **Time-blocking**: Schedule fixed, uninterrupted blocks of time for tasks. This helps you stay focused and avoid multitasking, which can decrease productivity. Start with 90-minute blocks, followed by 10-15 minute breaks.\n4. **Eliminate distractions**: Identify common distractions (social media, email, meetings) and limit them. Use tools like website blockers or apps that help you stay on track.\n5. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This technique helps you stay energized and avoid burnout.\n6. **Take care of yourself**: Adequate sleep, exercise, and nutrition are essential for maintaining energy and focus. Make time for self-care and prioritize your physical and mental well-being.\n7. **Learn to say no**: Be mindful of commitments and avoid overcommitting.

For example, check and respond to all emails at once, rather than constantly throughout the day.\n9. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, goals, and habits. Adjust your approach as needed to stay on track and make progress.\n10. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes or encounter setbacks. Acknowledge the feeling, and refocus on your goals.\n\nRemember, productivity is a personal and ongoing process. Experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter setbacks.\n\nLastly, don't compare yourself to others. Focus on your own journey, and recognize that everyone has their unique strengths, weaknesses, and challenges.

Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup, right?\n\nBefore you have a conversation with your boss, make a list of your non-negotiables. What are your absolute limits? What are your available work hours? What are your priorities outside of work? Be specific.\n\nWhen you talk to your boss, start by expressing your appreciation for the opportunity to work with her and the value you place on your collaboration. Then, clearly communicate your concerns and boundaries. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example:\n\n\"I've been noticing that I've been working longer hours than usual, and I'm concerned that it's impacting my family life. I want to ensure that I'm available for my child's needs and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I'm happy to discuss alternative arrangements that work for both of us, but I need to prioritize my family time.\"\n\nBe firm but respectful, and avoid making promises you can't keep.

I'm willing to work flexible hours, but I need to have some buffer time outside of work to recharge. Can we discuss a more realistic schedule that meets our needs?\"\n\nRemember, setting boundaries is not about being difficult; it's about being clear about what you can and cannot do. Your boss may need some time to adjust, but ultimately, you're setting a precedent for a healthier work-life balance.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to refer to your contract and remind your boss that you're paid for a 40-hour workweek. You're not trying to be a martyr or a slacker; you're simply advocating for your well-being and the well-being of your family.\n\nGood luck, and remember to prioritize self-care during this conversation!"

She then proceeded by arguing that because of my machismo mindset that men are sick minded and are the very reason why men objectify women thus being the sole reason why women get physically / sexually attacked or abused. I asked if that includes me and she said it's only a matter of time. I felt offended but didn't care too much to keep arguing since I know I would never do any harm because of my supposed machismo mindset. So, in order to stop arguing, I told her to post whatever she wants but to simply not ask for my opinion of which photos looks better and whatnot. She got angrier and said that I didn't want to support her and that in a way I envy her supposed success. I told her that I firmly believe in supporting her but in other ways but that I just didn't want to help her choose which photos I liked the most when it came down to choosing which photo (revealing photos) will her thousands of followers on instagram would see. I understand she needs engagement for her social media but those revealing photos receive her a lot of engagement from probably many guys that I don't know whether it's the way to go about it. She argues that I'm just a deeply insecure and jealous person. In the end, she said she doesn't want to be with someone who is repressing her from being who she is by posting photos that she wants, so told me to f*** off and kicked me out of her house. I'm trying to see her point of view and I don't know why I feel uncomfortable when she uploads a revealing photo. Any suggestions? Am I as old school? Did I miss something?\n\nTL;DR - my gf (F/31) and I (M/26) argue on whether or not she should be posting revealing photos of herself on her social media.",
    "human": "I think you feel uncomfortable because (a) you want to protect her, (b) you feel revealing photos should only be for you to see, and/or (c) you are scared men will flirt with her and she will flirt with them back and cheat on you. \n\n(a) The first one sounds fine, but that also means you feel like she needs protection and can't defend herself consequently. \n\n(b) It's okay to feel that way. But again, it is her body and it is her choice to who she shows it to. So either you learn to be okay with it, or you recognize the relationship just isn't a good match. \n\n(c) is a trust and jealousy issue. It's her responsibility to decide how she engages with her followers, not yours. Hopefully she respects your relationship enough to not cross boundaries you and her have discussed and agreed upon. If you don't trust her to do that, that's a bigger problem. \n\n(She's also not wrong with most of the things she said. I'd only really disagree with her getting that upset with you just because you don't want to select the pictures with her. It's understandable to want to be distanced from it, and she should've just accepted that. At the same time, it's probably a way for her to feel a little connected to you.)",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's quite a intense and complex conversation you've had with your girlfriend! I'm glad you're willing to explore your feelings and thoughts about this. It's understandable that you're struggling to reconcile your discomfort with her posts and her perspective.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's natural to feel uncomfortable when seeing someone you care about posting revealing photos, especially if you're not sure about the intentions behind it. It's not necessarily about being \"old school\" or having a \"machismo\" mindset; it's about feeling uneasy about the level of exposure and potential attention she's seeking.\n\nRegarding your girlfriend's argument that you're repressing her, it's important to recognize that she's trying to assert her independence and individuality. It's possible that she's using her social media as a way to reclaim her body and sexuality, which is a valid and empowering move. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your feelings and concerns are not necessarily about controlling or repressing her, but rather about your own emotional well-being and comfort.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings, focusing on your own emotions and experiences rather than attacking or blaming each other. You could express your concerns about the potential consequences of posting revealing photos, such as attracting unwanted attention or objectification. It's possible that she's not considering the potential risks or consequences of her actions.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your girlfriend's past experiences as a model and her current use of social media as a job may influence her perspective. She might be more comfortable with the level of exposure and attention she's receiving, but that doesn't mean you have to be comfortable with it too.\n\nConsider having a conversation about boundaries and compromise. You could express your willingness to support her in her career and personal endeavors, but also discuss what makes you uncomfortable and how you can find a middle ground that works for both of you. It's possible that you can find a compromise, such as her posting photos that make you feel more comfortable, or you both discussing and agreeing on the types of content she shares.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself during this challenging time. Remember that you deserve to feel comfortable and respected in your relationship, and it's okay to communicate your needs and boundaries.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise, understanding, and growth. It's possible to find a solution that works for both of you, but it requires open communication, empathy, and a willingness to listen to each other's perspectives."

That's a great step towards regaining control over your time and habits.\n\nNow, let's tackle the lingering dreams and cravings. It's not uncommon for our brains to crave what we've been used to, especially when it's a stimulating activity like watching esports. Here are a few strategies to help you overcome this:\n\n1. **Gradual exposure**: Instead of going cold turkey, try setting a specific time frame for your LoL watching, say 30 minutes to an hour, and stick to it. This will help your brain adjust to the new pace.\n2. **Replace with new habits**: Fill the time you'd normally spend watching LoL with other activities you enjoy, like reading, exercising, or learning a new skill. This will help your brain rewire its associations and create new habits.\n3. **Identify underlying motivations**: Reflect on why you started watching LoL in the first place. Was it the excitement, the social aspect, or the thrill of competition? Once you understand your motivations, you can find alternative ways to satisfy those needs without relying on LoL.\n4. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: When you do find yourself craving LoL, acknowledge the feeling and remind yourself that it's okay to feel that way. Take a few deep breaths, and gently refocus your attention on the present moment.\n5. **Create a \"reset\" ritual**: Establish a calming pre-bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, practicing gentle stretches, or writing in a journal.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With time and persistence, you can develop new habits and find a healthier balance in your life.\n\nHow do these suggestions resonate with you? Is there anything specific that you'd like to try or any concerns you have?"

It's also important to acknowledge that it's not necessarily about everything going wrong, but rather your perception of it.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to challenge those negative thoughts. When you start to feel like everything is going wrong, try to catch yourself and reframe those thoughts. Ask yourself, \"Is this really true?

Taking care of your basic needs can help improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety.\n\nIf you're feeling like you can't talk to anyone without sounding insane, try journaling or writing down your thoughts and feelings.

Freezing up in emergency situations is more common than you might think, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your abilities or bravery. Here are some tips to help you prepare and respond more effectively in the future:\n\n1. **Practice active imagination**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a hypothetical emergency scenario. Visualize the situation, your surroundings, and the actions you would take. This can help desensitize you to the stress and anxiety associated with emergencies, making it easier to react calmly when the situation arises.\n2. **Develop a pre-crisis routine**: Establish a regular routine that includes mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, or physical activity. This can help reduce your overall stress levels and increase your ability to focus in high-pressure situations.\n3. **Focus on the process, not the outcome**: Instead of worrying about the outcome of the situation, focus on the steps you need to take to address the crisis. Break down the situation into manageable tasks, and concentrate on executing each one correctly.\n4. **Train your brain to react, not overthink**: In emergency situations, your brain's \"fight or flight\" response can take over, leading to analysis paralysis. Practice mindfulness and self-awareness to recognize when you're overthinking, and refocus on taking action.\n5. **Develop a \"first-respondent\" mindset**: Train yourself to respond quickly and decisively, even if it's not perfect. Remember that your initial response is not as important as the actions you take in the following seconds and minutes.\n6. **Learn from others' experiences**: Read stories, watch videos, or take courses on crisis response and emergency management. Learning from others' experiences can help you develop a more effective response strategy.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice responding to simulated emergencies, the more comfortable you'll become with the process. This can be as simple as practicing role-playing scenarios with friends or family members.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's normal to feel overwhelmed in emergency situations. By implementing these strategies, you can improve your response and feel more confident in your ability to handle unexpected situations in the future.\n\nNow, take a deep breath and acknowledge that you're already taking steps to learn from this experience. That's the first step towards growth and improvement!"

Was it something you did? Something outside of your control? And on top of that, it's hard to shake off the feeling of disappointment and frustration.\n\nFor me, the most effective way to cope with failure is to focus on the process, not the outcome. When you're going through something like this, it's easy to get caught up in what didn't happen, but instead, try to focus on what you did do. What did you learn? What could you have done differently? What strengths did you use to get as far as you did?\n\nAnd don't be too hard on yourself, okay? It's easy to get caught up in self-blame, but that's not going to help you move forward. Instead, try to reframe your thinking. Instead of beating yourself up over what went wrong, try to think about what you can do differently next time. What skills do you need to develop? What resources do you need to access?\n\nAnd here's the thing: failure is not a one-time event. It's a process. We all fail, and we all will again. The key is to learn from those failures and use them to grow. So, instead of trying to avoid failure, try to see it as an opportunity to learn and improve.\n\nOh, and one more thing: don't be afraid to ask for help. Whether it's a friend, family member, or mentor, having someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of can be a huge help. And don't worry if you don't have the answers right away – just acknowledging that you don't know something and being willing to learn is a huge step.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not alone. Everyone fails, and everyone has to deal with the aftermath. It's okay to feel disappointed and frustrated, but try not to let it define you. You are not your failure. You are so much more than that."

We have a great relationship and the answer won't be \"leave her\".\n\nI work in a high-profile high stress job.  Most of the year its 24/7 on call/availability - but the pay is worth it and I am treated exceptionally well by my employer for my commitments.  In turn, I also get 4 weeks of PTO (my wife gets 3).  Financially we're well off, no debt, cost of living well under control with a fair chunk in to saving each year - so financially the problem below is no issue.\n\nOf our shared 3 weeks, we do 1 week abroad visiting her family in the summer, 1 week travelling with just the 3 of us, 1 week of \"flex\" where we decide how we want to use it (sometimes a weekend away and the rest at home doing projects).  The 4th week of mine is the issue.\n\nWith my job I NEED detox time.  1 week a year I take off to myself to do NOTHING.  I lay around and play video games, go to the gym, and do odds and ends that have collected.  I like to have 0 commitments, and basically just be a caveman for a week.  I am someone who values my \"me\" time and it's a huge relief when I can get it.\n\nMy wife is the opposite, she needs to be doing something.  I appreciate it and it's who she is.

This is the week - all my Christmas shopping is done, house is clean, I was ready to do sweet FA this week leading up to Christmas.\n\nLast night she told me (didn't ask me) she cancelled daycare this week so we could save the money - school is out and we were paying full pop for our provider (which I have NO issue with).  So I'm here with the kid unable to do what I want/need to do.  I can't play violent games, go to the gym, or watch trash TV with him around.\n\nAdditionally, she wants us to pick up a bunch of crap for xmas, reorganize the garage, go to the mall, and take the kid to the local indoor playground.\n\nI should have just stayed at work, at least I wouldn't be losing my PTO on anything.\n\nShe is sensitive, she feels that my 4th week is a privilege and I should use it for productive things.

I would hope that your closest relationship would actually be the one to support your authentic self best of all! \n\nCould it be conflict-avoidance on your part, where you've never explicitly stated your needs so as to 'not rock the boat'? Could it be, as others have suggested, resentment on your wife's part, where she needs detox time too and has never explicitly asked for it &amp; feels shitty if you get what she can't have? I don't mean to make either of you the villain. Communication is hard!! It could be useful to get super curious in an empathetic and non-judgmental way about what could be getting between your wife and understanding this thing about you, or about ways (intentionally or not) you've taken part in maybe not allowing her to know you better. \n\nI imagine that both of you are doing your best &amp; love each other a lot, and this is a situation where some of your deep personal needs are coming into conflict, with one or both of you not having the full story. It could be helpful to ask your wife about her down time and detox needs (with no wrong answers), so you're thinking about this in the broader context of getting both of your needs met.\n\nI would also encourage you to look deeper, when you call your wife 'sensitive.' If you have a sunburn, the area is 'sensitive,' but that doesn't mean that if someone bumps into the sunburned area it doesn't matter because it's just a sensitivity thing! It could be helpful to get really curious about the pain behind the sensitivity &amp; look for ways to be your wife's defender, in the same way you'd love for her to become your defender about needing detox time.\n\nBest of luck to both of you and your son!",

That's a crucial step in understanding each other's needs.\n\nWhen communicating with your wife about your detox week, try to use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed and stressed when I don't have time for myself during my detox week\" instead of \"You always ruin my detox week by booking things for us.\"\n\nIt's also essential to set clear boundaries and expectations. You can say, \"Hey, I understand we can do things together, but during my detox week, I need some alone time. Can we plan something else for another week?\"\n\nRegarding your wife's concerns about your 4th week being a privilege, you can acknowledge that it is a privilege, but also express your needs.

Ask if she wants to get some dinner (last-ditch attempt)- if no, ask question 2\n\n2. Ask her what she wanted out of inviting me in the first place (or something similar/less aggressive)\n\n3. Tell her I had a good time that night when she invited me over and if we could do it again sometime. (Add into #1 if it goes well)\n\n\nTL;DR girl gave me many obvious hints and I still chose to be an idiot and ignore them\n\n\nI’ve got a longer, more detailed summary in my profile, posted in r/nostupidquestions. \n\nI’ve also got a pair of shorts I need to return and I’m not sure how to do so",
    "human": "&gt;Did I do something wrong? \n\nNope, you did everything right. Could not have done it better.\n\n&gt;Should I have repeated the “can I kiss you” question? \n\nNo. By asking you put the ball in her court. If she wanted you to kiss her she would have said something.\n\n&gt;Should I keep trying? \n\nDefinitely not.\n\n&gt;Why did she drop so many hints but essentially say “no” when I asked if I could kiss her\n\nWho knows, and it doesn't matter. Maybe she just wanted a cuddle buddy. Maybe she changed her mind in the moment. Maybe she's a tease and gets off on the power trip. Maybe she has a secret boyfriend she was going to cheat on and suddenly got cold feet. You can't know, and more importantly *it doesn't matter.* \n\n&gt;*I’ve also got a pair of shorts I need to return and I’m not sure how to do so*\n\nInstead of one of your three options just text her and ask her. Be an adult and use your words!",
    "base_reply": "It sounds like you're taking a step back and re-evaluating the situation, which is a great first step. I'm happy to help you break it down.\n\nIt's possible that you didn't exactly \"fuck up\" your chances, but rather, you didn't quite align with her expectations or boundaries. Here's what I mean:\n\n* You picked up on the hints, which is great, but it seems like you might have misinterpreted them. The hints you mentioned (laughing at everything you said, asking you to change clothes, cuddling, and playful foot play) could be indicative of a desire for intimacy or a connection, but they don't necessarily mean she was ready for kissing or more.\n* When you asked to kiss her, her response (\"what\") was ambiguous, and you took it as a \"no.\" It's possible that she was caught off guard or wasn't expecting the question, which led to her response.\n* Her gradual disinterest and decline of your offers to hang out could indicate that she was feeling overwhelmed or unsure about the direction of the interaction.\n\nConsidering your options, I'd suggest trying #2: \"Ask her what she wanted out of inviting me in the first place.\" This approach shows you're interested in understanding her perspective and might help clear the air. It's a gentle way to re-engage the conversation and give her a chance to express her thoughts.\n\nAs for the \"Netflix and chill\" scenario, it's possible that she was genuinely interested in getting to know you better, but you misread the signals. It's not uncommon for people to send mixed signals, and it's okay to acknowledge that you might have misinterpreted the situation.\n\nRegarding the return of your shorts, I'd recommend taking a trip to the store during a non-peak hour or using their online return process if available.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're taking a step back and re-evaluating the situation. It's a sign of maturity and a willingness to learn from your experiences. Remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes – it's all part of the learning process!"

She stepped up to be our mom when we didn’t have one and we are so grateful for it. We love Lauren a lot and this just makes this sadder for me. Yesterday we overheard Lauren talking to a friend on the phone and she was talking about how it makes her sad around Christmas because she thinks we don’t love her as much as we did our real mom and that we probably don’t even love her and then she started crying.\n\n\nMe and my brother just want to show Lauren how much we truly do love and appreciate her but we have no clue how to.

It's natural to have mixed emotions, especially during holidays like Christmas.\n\nNow, regarding how to show Lauren that you love and appreciate her:\n\n1. **Talk to your dad**: Have an open conversation with your dad about what you overheard and how it made you feel. He might not be aware of Lauren's concerns, and it's crucial that you communicate your feelings to him. He can help mediate the situation and offer guidance on how to address Lauren's feelings.\n2. **Express gratitude**: Make a conscious effort to show Lauren specific examples of how she's been a positive influence in your life. You could write her a heartfelt letter, make her a small gift, or simply thank her for being there for you and your brother.

Be patient and understanding, and try not to take her concerns personally.\n6. **Seek support**: Consider talking to a trusted adult, like a teacher, counselor, or family friend, about your feelings and concerns. They can offer valuable guidance and support during this challenging time.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this process. Take care of yourself and your brother, and don't hesitate to seek help if you need it.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's okay if Lauren's feelings take time to resolve.

I dropped out of high school in year 11 then studied IT at a technical college. My ultimate goal in life is to live in somewhat seclusion and peace; in a self sustaining house and lifestyle.

    "base_reply": "Thank you for being honest about your current situation and sharing your goals with us. I'm here to help you navigate this journey.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to not have a clear direction or ambition at 20. Many people take their time figuring out what they want, and it's a normal part of life.\n\nTo get started, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Living in seclusion and having a self-sustaining lifestyle sounds like you're looking for a sense of independence and autonomy. Here are some tips to help you get closer to achieving that:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your education**: Since you dropped out of high school and didn't complete your IT studies, it might be helpful to explore alternative education paths or training programs that align with your interests. This could be online courses, vocational training, or even a gap-year program. This will help you gain new skills and build confidence.\n2. **Explore alternative career options**: While you mentioned having little to no ambition, it's essential to identify areas that interest you. Think about what you enjoy doing, what you're good at, and what the job market demands. You can start by researching job descriptions, salary ranges, and required skills. This will help you narrow down your options and create a foundation for future decisions.\n3. **Develop a routine**: Having a daily routine can help you feel more grounded and focused. Start by creating a schedule that includes time for self-care, personal development, and leisure activities. This will help you establish a sense of structure and purpose.\n4. **Network and build connections**: Attend local events, join online communities, or participate in hobbies that interest you. Building connections with like-minded individuals can lead to new opportunities, mentorship, and a sense of belonging.\n5. **Save and budget**: Living in seclusion and having a self-sustaining lifestyle will likely require some financial planning. Start by creating a budget, saving a small amount each month, and researching ways to reduce expenses.\n6. **Prioritize your mental and physical health**: Living in seclusion can be isolating, so it's crucial to prioritize your mental and physical well-being. Schedule time for exercise, meditation, and socializing (even if it's just online).\n7. **Take small steps towards your goal**: Don't feel like you need to have everything figured out immediately. Take small steps towards your goal, and be patient. You can start by researching sustainable living, off-grid living, or alternative housing options.\n\nTo make the path of least resistance, I recommend:\n\n* Start with small, achievable goals, and celebrate your successes along the way.\n* Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks.\n* Focus on building a strong foundation in one area before moving on to the next.\n* Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to take your time.\n\nRemember, your goal is to live in seclusion and peace, which is a beautiful aspiration. By taking small steps towards your goal, you'll be more likely to achieve it.\n\nWhat do you think about these suggestions? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there something you'd like to add or change?"

She was always the first one to reach out, reacting to my story posts.\n\nNow, every time me and my GF argue, she tends to make things quite existential. I tried to explain that to my GF and let her know that I find her request quite controlling and to be honest rather abusive but she wouldn’t listen.

Are you willing to re-evaluate your relationships with your ex and other exes to ensure you're not putting your current partner in a difficult position?\n\nIf you're willing to do some introspection and growth, you may want to reach out to your GF when she returns from her holiday. Apologize for not respecting her boundaries and express your willingness to work on the issues that led to the breakup.

Emergency Assistance Programs: Many organizations, such as the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), offer emergency assistance programs for students affected by COVID-19. You can search online for these programs and see if you're eligible.\n2. Crowdfunding: You could start a crowdfunding campaign on platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter to raise money for your tuition. Share your story and reach out to friends, family, and social networks to spread the word.\n3. Government Assistance: The U.S. government has implemented various programs to help students affected by COVID-19.

My only real issue with her, is her feelings towards me. She says she wants to spend her life with me too.\n\n \n\n\nTo be clear, I make mistakes, and fuck up, I forget to do things she's asked sometimes, or forget to do things around the house. One example is about three times a year I'll forget to put the bins out on bin night, and she get's extremely angry when I do. Another example is, at night when I come to bed, maybe 5 times a year I'll forget to lock the back door, and when she finds it unlocked in the morning she gets very upset. Sometimes I'll forget to do something specific that she asked me to do.\n\nSo yeah, I'm far from perfect, I'm forgetful and easily distracted. I'm almost certain I have ADHD. I try my best, and implement tools to try to stay on track and remember to do what I need to do, but I slip up. I don't want to go on medication.\n\n \n\nShe's really upset at me because yesterday I accidentally bumped our oven, didn't realise, and didn't correct it. I also had unlocked the door to her office (external to the house) to move something in there, but failed to shut the door and lock it when I left. \n\nI think it's pretty fair to get upset about this sort of thing, but she never forgives me. All of these mistakes just continue to build and build in her mind until she resents me. And when I make a small mistake, she's not just mad about that, she's mad about all the mistakes I've ever made over the years.\n\n \n\nWhen we fight, she's very angry, and I'm *usually* very calm and try to stay logical, but that upsets her. She doesn't want to hear me apologise, and she hates it when I tell her I'm trying, or that I'll try harder. She also hates it when I defend myself if I think she's being unfair. I'm not sure what she wants from me during these fights anymore, I can't apologise, or say I'll try to improve, but she also gets mad when I don't say anything, I'm just not sure what to say or do anymore.\n\n \n\nSo we just had a big fight, and I told her that it feels like she hates me sometimes, and asked her why she stays with me. I told her the only issue I have with her is how she feels towards me. She says she wants to go to therapy, which I'm willing to do, but it's not going to stop me from making mistakes like the ones I've talked about. I can't lie to her or to myself, I know I will continue to slip up.\n\n \n\nShe has mental health issues and struggles with certain aspects of life. She experienced a fair amount of childhood trauma. Working is really hard for her, but she does it as much as she can anyway and I'm always proud of her for that. She struggles with going to the supermarket, and with making phone calls, so I do that sort of thing for her. I drive her to work a few times a week. I try to help her with little things like that when she's struggling. I also own most of our house, we're paying it off together but I put forward the majority of the deposit. I think all of these things make it hard for her to leave me, and while she says I'm her favourite person, and she doesn't want to leave, I wonder if she would have left a long time ago if she was more independent. She says she wouldn't have.\n\n \n\nI feel like I might be poorly representing her, but she really is a special and awesome person who can be very caring, and we have fun together. I love her, and she loves me too. But it's almost like black and white, it doesn't take much for her to flip when I make a mistake.\n\n \n\n\nI'm about to leave for a long business trip, and if we were ever going to break up, this would be the perfect time. She would have more than a month with me gone, to figure out what she wants to do, where she wants to go etc. I don't want to leave her, and I feel like if I did it would be more for her than for me, which is super weird. I just don't see this getting any better, and she isn't happy with me.\n\n \n\nShould I wait until I get back home and try out therapy, or should we end it before I leave?\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr**: I love my partner, and although she loves me too, frequently gets mad at me for making mistakes, no matter how hard I try.\n\n \n\nSorry, I can't seem to add a flair.\n\nEdit: I can't believe this blew up. I'm thankful that most people didn't say the usual \"dump her\" bullshit. I'm grateful for those that are focusing on how my mistakes make her feel. To those of you who feel like she is crazy or the bad guy here then I have misrepresented the situation. We both struggle with things.

Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and feelings. Express your love and appreciation for her, but also acknowledge the impact of your mistakes on her feelings.\n2. Work together to find ways to improve communication and conflict resolution. This may involve setting boundaries, practicing active listening, and finding constructive ways to address your mistakes.\n3. Consider couples therapy, as you mentioned, to work through these issues together. A professional can help you both develop healthier communication patterns and coping mechanisms.\n4. Take this opportunity to reflect on your own emotions and feelings. What are your non-negotiables in the relationship? What are you willing to work on, and what are you not?\n\nAs for your question about whether to wait until you get back home or end the relationship before you leave, I would suggest having a conversation with your partner about your concerns and feelings. Be honest about your fears and doubts, but also express your love and commitment to working through these issues together.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and understanding.

Can we find a way to communicate that feels safer and more respectful for both of us?\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that you've already suggested therapy, and it's not up to you to set up the appointment. You can gently reiterate your concern for her well-being and express your desire to work together to improve your communication and conflict resolution skills.\n\nLastly, remember that you deserve to feel safe and respected in your relationship. If her behavior continues and you don't see any changes, it may be worth considering whether this relationship is truly healthy and sustainable for you in the long run."

What do i do?",
    "human": "So basically, he doesn't want you to get the attention that he giving to other women? What you do really does depend on how important hypocrisy is to you and whether or not you're okay with him having a say in what content you post.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt, confused, and frustrated.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your boyfriend's behavior is not okay. It's not acceptable for him to be angry with you for posting photos of yourself, while he's doing the same with other women. It's a double standard, and it's unfair.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you took a bold step by posting provocative photos to prove a point, but it's not surprising that it backfired. You were trying to address the issue in a passive-aggressive way, which can be hurtful and confusing for your partner.\n\nNow, regarding the situation at hand, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and safety. Since he's giving you the silent treatment, it's crucial to focus on nurturing yourself and your relationships with others.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. Take a break: Give yourself space and time to process your emotions. It's okay to take a step back and focus on yourself.\n2. Communicate with friends and family: Reach out to trusted friends and family members for support and guidance. They can offer you a different perspective and help you work through your feelings.\n3. Set boundaries: If you feel comfortable, have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how his behavior makes you feel. Be specific about what you need from him in terms of respect and communication.\n4. Re-evaluate the relationship: Ask yourself if this relationship is healthy for you. Are you feeling valued, respected, and heard? If not, it might be time to re-assess whether this relationship is worth your time and energy.\n5. Focus on self-care: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your own needs.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness in any relationship. It's not your fault that your boyfriend is behaving in this way, and it's not your responsibility to change him. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs."

    "sentence": "My bf (26M) and I (24F) have been together for the last six years. I know we’re young, and have our whole lives ahead of us, but in this moment I’m really feeling a bit like my world is ending and need some advice. \n\nThings haven’t always been great, but for the most part, they have. We met at University, and have since both gotten our masters degrees. He’s currently working full time, and I’m in some weird patch between jobs (I have several part time jobs, which currently make up full time work, but only one of which is relatively stable). I’m not actively looking for work, as I have literally just finished my thesis and am super burned out. My bf, on the other hand, is loaded. Whilst I come from a middle class background, he’s very much of the upper sociodemographic group. I moved out of my home town to go to university and have worked my way throughout my entire degree to be able to afford to rent &amp; food. My bf lived at home throughout his entire degree (his home is in the same town), and has always had his mum to cook, clean and do whatever for him. Now he’s working full time, he has copious amounts of money - he’s just bought a brand new car, and is forever investing into building some new part for his PC. \n\nWhich leads to probably the biggest issue in our relationship - my partners hesitancy to move out of home. He, essentially, doesn’t want too, and I can hardly blame him. He doesn’t pay for anything, and his mum acts like his own personal maid. I’ve been asking for years (3) to try living together - because I really, really care about the guy and envision a future with him. I won’t deny that it’d also help me financially (we’d split the rent), but that has never been the motive to move in together. \n\nA month ago, I got the opportunity to housesit for some family while they’re over in Europe. It worked out perfectly, as my rental contract was ending, and it meant I’d have a little break in paying rent. It does, however, mean I have no where to go come early October. My bf agreed to come stay with me, as like a trial of what it might be like to live together. And I thought things were going really really well - we haven’t fought, we cook together, laugh together, watch our favourite tv shows. He still goes out to do his hobbies and sports, and I do mine. \n\nBut last night, I brought up the topic of needing to find somewhere to live, and if we should be trying to look for somewhere together, as my time housesitting is quickly running out. And he said “No, I don’t want to live with you.” He basically went on to tell me that he doesn’t see a future with me, and doesn’t want to settle with me, as there are “too many little things that we don’t align in” (i.e. he doesn’t like how I act when I’m stressed, although says he can “tolerate” it, and doesn’t like that I “don’t play a sport” - which confused me bc we’ve just come out of winter in the country we’re in, and I’m an avid hiker. I go nearly every weekend). \n\nHe told me he thinks he can do better than me, and that he couldn’t ever be happy settling with me. I asked him if he genuinely felt that way, why had he stayed all these years and essentially lead me on? He said because it was between choosing losing me as a friend, or keeping me, and that he didn’t want to lose me. But he always knew what my intentions and hopes were for the relationship (a long term, committed relationship), because I have always been very honest about it, and because I have always been so open about it and he’s never disagreed or brought up otherwise, I thought he was on the same page. \n\nEvidently we’re not though. He’s also told me he has plans to leave our country at the end of 2023 and work abroad for 5-10 years - and that he wants to do that single. He wouldn’t consider going with me, as being in a relationship is a “burden” to meeting new people. This isn’t the first time he’s told me this - he told me a few years ago that he wanted to move at the end of the year, and then COVID happened, and he didn’t. We discussed this early on in our relationship, and had always anticipated we’d go explore the big wide world together, as it’s also a dream of mine. \n\nSo… I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do. I think deep down, I know this is the beginning of the end, but I don’t want it to be. I don’t want to be with someone who cannot envision a future with me, and I’m so upset and angry at myself that I’ve stayed for so long with someone who has never intended on committing to me. But at the same time, I keep telling myself we’ve made it this far, what if things change or get better? \n\nI truly, truly love this guy. We holiday together, spend time with each other’s families, and absolutely I’m terrified of losing him. He has been my Rock over the last few years, and has always been there for me to turn too when I need him. And now, I won’t have anywhere to live in a few weeks, I don’t have a job lined up, and the one stable thing in my life has just told me he doesn’t see a future with me. \n\nHe hasn’t asked to break up, and says he doesn’t want to. In fact, he’s offered to move in with me anyway because at least we’ll be stable together, and we’re good friends outside of our relationship. But I worry that that’s only prolonging the inevitable, and that I’m just going to be left even more heartbroken in a years time, when he DOES leave. I don’t know if there’s anyway I could change his mind, nor do I want to try to change his mind. I would be open to him travelling solo for 3-6 months, or moving overseas with him, but he doesn’t want either of those things. \n\nAlternatively, I could stay in this town, not break up, and find somewhere to live alone, which would likely run me into huge amounts of debt/drain my savings. But I wouldn’t have to do the emotional work of leaving him, and starting anew. He’s genuinely my best friend. \n\nOr I could move back to my hometown, and in with the parents. I would lose my jobs in my current town, one of which I’ve had for 6+ years, and all the friends I’ve made up here and would essentially be back to ground 0. The prospect makes me feel sick. I’d have no friends, no job, and be living at home. I really struggle to make friends, and out myself out there and I worry I’d just become a social recluse who lives at home with no job, no hobbies, no friends and just no motivation. \n\nI’m at a complete loss as to what to do. Do I break up? Do I stay? Do I go home? Is there another option I haven’t considered? \n\nTLDR: my bf (26m) says he doesn’t see a future with me (24f), and doesn’t want to live with me. I’m going to be homeless &amp; jobless in a matter of weeks, so do I accept the fact there’s an expiry date on our relationship and move in with him anyway, or abandon everything I’ve ever known and move back home?",

It's okay to feel angry, sad, and confused.\n2. Focus on yourself and your own well-being. You've been putting others' needs before your own for a long time; it's time to prioritize your own happiness.\n3. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to work through your emotions and gain a better understanding of your worth and what you deserve in a relationship.\n4. Start exploring new opportunities and connections in your current town. You've built a life there, and it's worth fighting for.\n5. Don't be afraid to take a break or distance yourself from your partner. You deserve space to figure out what you want and what's best for you.\n\nRemember, you are worthy of love, respect, and happiness. You deserve someone who wants to build a life with you, not just tolerate you."

It's understandable that you're looking for ways to cope. \n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to experience memory lapses under pressure. It's a common phenomenon called \"test anxiety-induced amnesia.\" \n\nTo address this, I'd recommend a few strategies to help you build confidence and reduce anxiety during tests:\n\n1. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization can help calm your nerves. You can find guided recordings online or through mobile apps like Headspace or Calm.\n2. **Break down the test into smaller chunks**: Instead of looking at the entire test, focus on one question at a time. Take your time, and read each question carefully before answering. This can help reduce overwhelm.\n3. **Use positive self-talk**: Before the test, remind yourself that you're well-prepared and capable. Focus on your strengths, and try to reframe negative thoughts.\n4. **Get enough sleep and exercise**: Adequate rest and physical activity can help reduce overall stress levels. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep and regular exercise.\n5. **Visualize success**: Instead of imagining yourself writing the test, try visualizing yourself acing it. Imagine yourself feeling confident and prepared. This can help boost your mood and reduce anxiety.\n\nAs for pretending to be at home, I'd advise against it. While it might provide temporary relief, it's essential to confront and overcome your test anxiety head-on. Instead, focus on developing coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your nerves.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel some level of anxiety during tests. The key is to learn how to manage it effectively. With practice and patience, you can develop the skills to perform well under pressure.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these strategies further or discuss other ways to cope with test anxiety?"

    "sentence": "Listen, I’m not saying he shouldn’t jack off, or that it’s bad too. But we’ve been dating for 3 years, and our sex life has slowly dwindled down and down. I initiate 85% of the time, with him sometimes even getting soft in the midst of it. He says he masturbates daily at least, and I’ve caught him watching porn quite a few times. He insists this has nothing to do with our sex lives, but with his porn watching going up, the amount of times we have sex has gone further and further down. \n\nCurrently, we’ve gone 2 and a half weeks without doing it. Before that it was almost a month. It’s been a busy few weeks, so I thought maybe this weekend when we hung out and just chilled, it’d be time. I mentioned that I shaved, that I got new sheets, at one point straight up asked if he wanted to fuck and it was a no. Yet yesterday, I called him a few hours after he had gone home and he said he had already masturbated twice in the few hours since we had seen each other. \n\nIt just sucks. I work out, I maintain myself, and our relationship is literally perfect except for this. Do we just have different sex drives, does he have a porn addiction, is there anything I can do? \n\nTLDR: My BF barely has sex with me despite masturbating daily / frequently watching porn. How do I confront him about this?",
    "human": "It sounds like this might have edged into a porn addiction - he’s using the endorphin hit to self-soothe some kind of emotional or anxiety filled void. \n\nI would lay it all out on the table: “boyfriend, I am not satisfied with our current sex life. I need to have more intimacy and connection.” A couples therapist might help him to see that his “normal habit” is actually being detrimental to his relationship.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like a really frustrating and confusing situation.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and concerns. It's understandable that you're wondering if you're just having different sex drives or if there's something more going on.\n\nBefore you confront your BF, take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to have different sexual needs and desires in a relationship. It's not uncommon for couples to have different libidos, and it's not necessarily a problem. However, the fact that he's not initiating sex with you and seems to be prioritizing his own solo activities (masturbation and porn) over your needs is a concern.\n\nWhen you do confront him, try to approach the conversation calmly and non-accusatorily. Avoid blaming or attacking language, as this can put him on the defensive. Instead, express your feelings and concerns in a \"I\" statement. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I've noticed that we haven't been having sex as frequently as we used to, and I've been feeling a bit disappointed and frustrated. I've been trying to initiate things, but it seems like you're not really interested. I understand that we all have different sex drives, but I feel like we're not connecting on that level anymore. Can we talk about what's going on and see if we can find a way to rekindle our intimacy?\"\n\nIt's also important to ask him about his feelings and needs. Ask him what he's been feeling, if there's something bothering him, or if he's just not feeling connected to you in that way. Listen actively and try to understand his perspective.\n\nRegarding his porn use, it's important to address this as well. Porn use can be a complex issue, and it's not necessarily an addiction, but it can be a sign of underlying issues. You can ask him about his feelings about his porn use and how it affects your relationship. Be specific about how it makes you feel and how you'd like him to prioritize your relationship.\n\nLastly, consider having an open and honest conversation about your own needs and desires. What do you want from your sex life? What are your boundaries? What are you willing to compromise on? This can help you both understand each other better and find a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship. It's okay to have difficult conversations, and it's okay to disagree. But by approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding, you can work together to find a solution that strengthens your relationship."

I am better able to distinguish between anxiousness and excitement/happiness.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It can be really tough to distinguish between excitement and anxiety, especially when they're closely linked emotions. And it's great that you've had experience with CBT and are familiar with recognizing your thoughts and feelings. Let me offer some additional insights and suggestions that might help.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's normal to feel both excitement and anxiety about certain situations. It's natural to have a mix of emotions, and it doesn't mean you're flawed or that something's wrong with you. It's just your brain's way of processing information.\n\nOne thing you might try is to pay attention to the physical sensations in your body. When you're excited, your body often responds with physical sensations like a racing heart, sweaty palms, or a feeling of lightness or energy. When you're anxious, the sensations might be more intense, like a racing heart, trembling, or a sense of heaviness.\n\nNotice how your body responds to different situations. Are you more likely to feel a racing heart when you're excited about a concert, or when you're anxious about a new job? Are your palms sweating more when you're looking forward to seeing friends or when you're worried about a social event?\n\nAnother approach is to practice mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the present moment. When you're feeling anxious or excited, take a few deep breaths, and focus on the sensations in your body. Try to label them as \"excitement\" or \"anxiety\" without judgment. This can help you become more attuned to the physical cues and better distinguish between the two emotions.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your intuition is trying to tell you something, but it's not always accurate. Our intuition can be influenced by our past experiences, biases, and emotions. When you're feeling anxious about a situation, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if they're based on facts or if they're just your brain's worst-case scenario. Practice reframing those thoughts by focusing on the positive aspects of the situation.\n\nLastly, consider keeping a journal or log to track your emotions and physical sensations. Writing down your feelings and thoughts can help you identify patterns and gain insights into what's driving your emotions. This can also help you develop a greater awareness of your emotions and improve your ability to recognize the difference between excitement and anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take time to develop a better understanding of your emotions. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but try to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a bit more clarity and balance in your emotions. Remember to be kind to yourself and prioritize your well-being."

During my relationship with Mary, I met and got to know Sara (35F) and after things ended with Mary, I asked Sara out. She declined with a rather hurtful rejection about she's not into men who date teenagers.\n\nI just want to make it clear Mary is the only teenager I've ever dated. Before Mary I was in a 10 year relationship with a woman close to my own age, so this isn't a habit of mine. But I respected Sara's decision.\n\nI then met another woman on Tinder, Annie (28F) and we went on a few dates. All was going well till we began chatting about past relationships and she was visibly disturbed when I told her about Mary. I explained it was a very brief relationship but after that date she said she \"didn't see a future.\"\n\nMy latest experience was with Lily (36F), who I liked tremendously and saw a real future with. We were looking through each other's phone galleries and chatting about photos, and she found one of me and Mary from last year. When I told I dated Mary for a while she looked at me like I was a piece of dirt on her shoe. She is now ghosting me, so it seems like that relationship's down the toilet now too.\n\nAt this point I have to ask: Should I just not tell women about Mary? It was a very short relationship, I don't feel it characterizes my dating history or my preferences, and it's not relevant to who I am today. All it seems to do is make women see me as a creep, which I am not.\n\nTLDR: Briefly dated a 19 year old last year. When women find out about it they get cold feet. Do I need to tell them?",
    "human": "That you could date a 19 year old at your age is not irrelevant to who you are today and it does characterise something about you.

Disclose that growth to your dates when relationship history is discussed and try to get ahead of the assumptions women are making about you based on this age gap relationship.

It's not surprising that women are reacting negatively to your revelation, given the significant age gap and the potential power imbalance that comes with it.

If you choose not to disclose this information, you may be risking building relationships on a foundation of deception, which can be damaging in the long run.\n\nRather than deciding not to tell women about Mary, I would suggest being more thoughtful and intentional about how you share this information. Instead of blurting it out, consider having an open and honest conversation about your past relationships, including the age gap and why it didn't work out. This can help set clear boundaries and expectations for your current relationships.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the way you present this information can make a big difference. Instead of making it seem like a casual, brief fling, try framing it as a learning experience that helped you grow and develop as a person. Highlight what you learned from the relationship and how it's informed your approach to dating and relationships today.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how much you want to share and how you want to present this information. However, I would caution against simply avoiding the topic altogether, as this can create more problems in the long run. By being open, honest, and thoughtful, you can build trust and respect with your partners, even if they may not immediately agree with your choices."

Start with small, achievable steps, and be patient with yourself. You don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nAs for downvotes, don't worry about them! Focus on your own growth and well-being, and don't let others' opinions dictate your self-worth."

    "human": "Just remember the only thing you have control of is your own car. You have no way to know what others are going to do, so have confidence in your own driving. \n\nEventually with time you'll notice small patterns in the way other cars/drivers move before they do what they are about to do. On the highway a slight veer to the side of the line often indicates a poor driver checking to see if they can switch lanes, so even if you dont see their turn signal going, probably not a good idea to get beside them. \nAnother thing I like to do to help keep more control of the situation is to have other cars to my side for the least amount of time possible. Either by speed up to make sure I'm ahead of them, or letting them speed up to be past me. This helps alleviate my anxiety in two ways. 1) I know they cant barrel into me from the side since I'm not beside them. 2) I have room to switch lanes in an emergency (Something on the highway for example) Most people I think try to do this to some extent without thinking, but making a conscious decision to do it will help reduce allot of stress. Just make sure you don't impede any traffic, it becomes very natural eventually.\n\nHope this helps some.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Driving anxiety is a real thing, and it's awesome that you're acknowledging it and seeking help. Here are some tips that might help you feel more calm and confident behind the wheel:\n\n1. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of 4, holding for 4, and exhaling for 4. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups.\n2. **Focus on the present moment**: Instead of worrying about the future (e.g., \"What if I crash?\"), focus on the present moment. Pay attention to your surroundings, the road, and your breath. Mindfulness can be a game-changer.\n3. **Break it down**: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire drive, break it down into smaller tasks. Focus on one task at a time, like merging onto a highway or navigating a busy intersection.\n4. **Use positive self-talk**: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations, like \"I've got this,\" \"I'm a capable driver,\" or \"I can handle this.\" It might sound cheesy, but it can help shift your mindset.\n5. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you drive, the more comfortable you'll become. Try to drive in different conditions, like rush hour or nighttime driving, to help build your confidence.\n6. **Use visualizations**: Imagine yourself driving successfully, navigating through challenging situations, and arriving at your destination safely. Visualize your anxiety melting away with each passing mile.\n7. **Get comfortable with small mistakes**: Nobody's perfect, and it's okay to make small mistakes. Acknowledge them, learn from them, and move on. Don't let fear of making mistakes paralyze you.\n8. **Consider a driving buddy**: Having a trusted friend or family member ride with you can provide emotional support and help distract you from anxious thoughts.\n9. **Take breaks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, pull over and take a break. Get out of the car, stretch, and do some deep breathing exercises. Sometimes, taking a break can help you recharge and feel more centered.\n10. **Seek professional help**: If your driving anxiety is impacting your daily life or causing significant distress, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean you're a bad driver. With time, practice, and patience, you can learn to manage your anxiety and become a more confident driver."

Use \"I\" statements to describe your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language.\n\nFor example, you could say something like: \"Dad, I love having family and friends over, but I've noticed that we've had a lot of visitors lately, and it's been a bit challenging for me to find some quiet time to myself.

The ring is worth over $500.  Thank you.",

It's almost certainly \"only\" misdemenor (usually Grand Theft, or a felony, is around $2k depending on the state) and your chances of getting prosecuted are very low for a $500 ring they willingly gave to you and even bugged you to come get. You could get a receipt for it, making it even more convoluted for them. You wouldn't have a very good defense if they DID figure it out, but they most likely misplaced the records for the ring you picked up if they're after you about it and prepared another ring for you. It'll most likely get written off, but you should also consider whether it's a small jewelry shop or a big chain (although I don't at all know how jewelry frnachises work).

You could send an email or give them a call and explain the situation in a polite and apologetic manner. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hi [Jeweler's Name], I wanted to reach out to you about the ring I ordered a month ago. I actually picked it up a few weeks ago, but I forgot to confirm with you.

It's better to be honest and transparent, especially when dealing with a business that you plan to continue working with in the future. Honesty is always the best policy, and it's likely that the jeweler will appreciate your integrity.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's how you handle them that matters.

They have expensive things not to show off (that's those who aren't yet rich and/or new money who still are thinking like those who aren't yet rich) but because those things are of Buy It For Life quality.

This will help you get comfortable with talking to people again.\n2. **Identify your goals**: What are you looking for in a partner or relationship? Clarifying your goals will help you focus on what you want and make it easier to approach potential matches.\n3. **Update your social life**: Attend events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, or take classes.

Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go as planned.\n5. **Practice self-reflection**: Take time to reflect on what's holding you back from asking someone out. Is it fear of rejection? Insecurity? Lack of confidence? Once you identify the root cause, work on addressing it.\n6. **Find a wingman or wingwoman**: Having a friend or acquaintance who's also looking to date can provide moral support and help you feel more at ease.\n7. **Try online dating**: If you're struggling to meet people in person, consider online dating.

Focus on building connections and having fun along the way.\n9. **Learn to be more open-minded**: Don't dismiss someone just because they're not your \"type.\" Be willing to explore different personalities and interests.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, like having a nice conversation or going on a decent date. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.\n\nRemember, getting back into the dating scene takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't give up!"

I captured myself being liberated in my element and really being in touch with my body and I never get that horny on my own.\n\nAnyway so today I sent it to him whilst we were on a video call and he immediately bursts out laughing, clasping his head into his hands. I laughed too initially because for me it is a bit of an 'out there' picture to take/send. He was laughing for about 1 whole minute before I asked him what was so funny. Naturally I began to feel quite insecure. He said my face looked funny and he just wasn't expecting it. I went on to explain how I was in my element and in touch with my body etc and he didn't offer me any kind of reassurance that this is a good thing and it's nice to see. Instead he kept repeating himself whilst still giggling, saying he just wasn't expecting me to be pulling a silly face.\n\nAnyway there was a lot of back and forth, me explaining the above and him stupidly repeating himself, not clocking that I am upset by his reaction EVEN after telling him that this is hurtful and upsetting. He knows that I am quite reserved and shy about doing this type of thing, especially including my face and although he said sorry I feel like he just said sorry to get out of this and when asking him what he is apologising for he didn't really seem to tick the right boxes for me, for example, he didn't acknowledge hurting my feelings, what he did wrong, not being more reassuring and instead digging himself a bigger hole (he said it reminded him of pornstars pulling the same face on their pornhub accounts to entice viewers).\n\nWe have been together for so long we've been through a lot of conversations about what works and what doesn't in different situations we've argued over.

I remind myself that it's okay to do nothing, and that sometimes, doing nothing is the most productive thing I can do.\n\nLater, I might engage in a creative activity that brings me joy – painting, drawing, writing, or playing an instrument. This is a great way to express myself, tap into my emotions, and cultivate a sense of fulfillment.\n\nAs the day winds down, I reflect on my experiences and emotions. I journal, meditate, or practice deep breathing exercises to process my thoughts and feelings. I acknowledge my accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem, and I celebrate my resilience.\n\nFinally, I wrap up the day with a gentle transition back into my daily routine. I might watch a funny movie, have a cup of tea, or practice some gentle stretches before bed. I prioritize a restful night's sleep, knowing that I've taken care of myself and set myself up for a stronger, more compassionate tomorrow.\n\nRemember, a mental health day is not about being productive or achieving something specific. It's about being kind, gentle, and patient with yourself. It's about acknowledging your needs, honoring your boundaries, and taking the time to recharge. By prioritizing self-care and self-compassion, you'll be better equipped to handle the challenges that life throws your way."

    "sentence": "TL;DR\n\nHi\n\nI'm 31(M) and my (ex)partner is 26(F).\n\nWe are talking about getting married and then a couple of days ago she insisted on me telling her how much I earn but did stipulate I didn't have to tell her now but just  when we got married.\n\nWhen we first started dating We discussed financial responsibilities we both feel are necessary for a married couple. She initially claimed that the fair way to split expenses e.g  mortgage and bills was that the person who earns more pays the majority of the bills and the person who pays less gives a small contribution.sound like she wanted an 75/25 split or something like that. It was clear that she was able to pay 50% of the expenses and still have enough left over to have a reasonably good lifestyle(similar to what she has now) so it wasn't like she wasn't able to afford it or it would leave her in a very difficult position.\n\nI challenged this and after a few days of back and forth arguing which to be honest was very draining and stressful she finally agreed because we realised that actually because my normal expenditure is more than hers, we currently have a similar ammount of income left over after expenses anyway...essentially she only agreed 50/50 because we have the same ammount left over currently...if I had more than her than she would have expected I pay the majority of expenses even though she would live in the same house, eat the same food and use the same electricity.\n\nAnyway so a couple of days ago she asked me how much I earn. I initially felt very awkward and tried to dodge the question but she persisted and asked again so I politely refused to divulge any information. She then asked if I was willing to tell her the ammount when we get married and I said no. We then had a few intense arguments and she then threatened to end the relationship if I wouldn't tell her. I then asked her to make a comittment that if I told her my income, she wouldn't then use the surplus money to make demands or argue with me about what we spent the money on and that she would allow me to spend it the way I wanted(albeit I made it clear that the vast majority would end up being eventually  either spent in a charitable way or on the good of the family unit). She then told me that she would only demand I spend money on specific things that were  important issues but said she didn't want to guarantee that she wouldn't ask me to spend it on a non important issue because there was a \"1% chance that she might change her mind for whatever reason\"\n\nI then asked her to define what important issues were e.g. if by important issue there is a leak and she can't afford to pay 50% for it from her income that's fine I'll pay for it..but if she wants to spend tens of thousands on a new kitchen and I feel there is something better we should spend the money on, I want to be able to have the final say in it..she basically didn't end up giving me an example of what important is..in addition her lifestyle is more lavish than mine so I felt it unfair to tell her how much I earn in the future because if there is a leak for example and she can't pay for it, the only reason she can't pay is because she was more frivolous than me and spent her money on enjoying herself instead of saving for a rainy day because her husband has it covered..\n\nYesterday she broke up with me saying she couldn't be with me if I wasn't willing to share how much I earn when we get married.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts. Is it reasonable for me to want to keep this private as long as I keep up with the actual financial commitments we've agreed on? \n\nAnd is she being rash by ending this relationship considering it was going so well before this argument?\n\nP.s. Full disclosure she did tell me how much she earns fairly early on but I didn't ever ask her to tell me, she randomly bought it up.\n\nThanks",
    "human": "&gt;I'd love to hear your thoughts. Is it reasonable for me to want to keep this private as long as I keep up with the actual financial commitments we've agreed on?\n\nAbsolutely not. You are firmly in the wrong.\n\nYou can't be private with your finances if you were planning on marrying someone. Marriage is a legal agreement. When you get married, your partner's debts become your own. It's not a conversation you can keep private. \n\nIt is absolutely important going into a marriage that both parties agree about finances. From the rest of the post, it seems like you likely won't, so a breakup was likely in the cards anyway.",
    "base_reply": "I can sense the frustration and concern in your message. Let's break down the situation and offer some insights.\n\nFirstly, it's completely reasonable to want to keep your income private, especially if you've already agreed on financial commitments and are fulfilling them. You're not hiding anything, and your partner is asking for information that's not necessary for the relationship or your shared financial responsibilities.\n\nRegarding your partner's request, it's understandable that she wants to know your income to feel more secure and comfortable in the relationship. However, her persistence and ultimatum are concerning. It's not about being \"rash\" to end the relationship, but rather about prioritizing her own needs and boundaries.\n\nIn your previous conversations, you've already addressed the financial responsibilities and split expenses fairly. It's essential to recognize that your partner's request is not just about financial planning but also about trust, control, and power dynamics in the relationship.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Your partner's past behavior: She shared her income with you fairly early on, which might indicate that she's not comfortable with secrecy or has a different approach to financial openness.\n2. Her expectations: Her initial suggestion of a 75/25 split and her later agreement to 50/50 might suggest that she's not willing to compromise or adapt to your financial situation.\n3. Her lifestyle: Her lavish spending habits and lack of savings might be a concern, as you mentioned. If she's not willing to adjust her spending habits or prioritize saving, it could lead to future financial issues.\n4. Your boundaries: You've set clear boundaries around your financial information, and it's essential to respect your own needs and priorities.\n\nConsidering these points, it's crucial to reflect on whether you're willing to compromise on your boundaries and potentially compromise your financial security. If you're not comfortable sharing your income, it's essential to communicate your concerns and boundaries clearly to your partner.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your financial priorities, boundaries, and expectations. You could explain that you're willing to continue fulfilling your financial commitments but would like to maintain your privacy regarding your income. If your partner is unwilling to respect your boundaries, it might be a sign that the relationship is not sustainable for you.\n\nRemember, honesty and communication are essential in any relationship. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries while still being open and respectful."

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're seeking a neutral perspective on this situation. It's understandable that you felt uncomfortable and bothered by your girlfriend's comment, and it's okay that you wanted to express your feelings to her.\n\nWhile it's true that some people might brush off comments like that, it's also important to recognize that your feelings are valid. You didn't ask for this information, and bringing it up in a seemingly casual way can be perceived as invasive and insensitive.\n\nYour girlfriend's comment was likely an attempt to manipulate you, and it's not okay to use someone's insecurities or emotions as a means to an end. It's not about being \"petty\" or playing games, but rather about respecting each other's boundaries and feelings.\n\nIn this case, your reaction was not an overreaction. You had every right to express your discomfort and unhappiness with the comment, and it's important that you did. It's okay to set boundaries and communicate your feelings with your partner, especially when it comes to something that made you feel uncomfortable or disrespected.\n\nGoing forward, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you felt and why. You can express your concerns and boundaries in a non-accusatory way, using \"I\" statements to describe your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, you could say something like:\n\n\"I felt uncomfortable when you brought up that bus stop and mentioned late-night calls. It made me feel like you were trying to provoke a reaction from me, and it didn't feel respectful. I value our relationship and want us to communicate openly and honestly. Can we work on being more considerate of each other's feelings and boundaries?\"\n\nRemember that communication is key in any relationship, and it's okay to address issues as they arise. By expressing your feelings and needs, you can work together to build a stronger and more respectful connection."

My wife Nickey (30f) has been a stepmom to my kids ( 8m and 8f)for a while and recently told me she wants to adopt them. Their mother (who was my girlfriend at the time) died during childbirth and so my kids have never had a mother figure in their lives until Nickey came along.\n\n\nMy kids absolutely love Nickey and have been calling her mom since before we were married. I’ve managed to keep their mother’s presence in their lives and we frequently visit her parents and family so they can know them. \n\n\nNickey brought up the idea of adopting them so that way they can have a mom in their lives and that if something happens to me she can stay with them.

I'm happy to help you work through your concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're worried about your kids losing their biological mother's name on their birth certificates. That's a significant change, and it's natural to want to preserve their connection to their birth mother. It's also reasonable to consider the potential impact on your late girlfriend's family and the possibility of them feeling like you're trying to erase her memory.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that Nickey has been a loving and caring presence in your kids' lives for a while now. They've already formed a strong bond with her, and she's been a steady and supportive influence. It's possible that adopting her as their mom could bring them a sense of stability and security that they've been missing.\n\nI think it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with Nickey about your concerns. It's great that you're hesitant to bring it up, but it's better to address this sooner rather than later. You could start by expressing your appreciation for her desire to take on a more formal role in your kids' lives and acknowledging the positive impact she's had on them.\n\nThen, you could gently share your concerns about the potential risks of adoption, including the loss of their birth mother's name on their birth certificates and the potential impact on your late girlfriend's family. It's crucial to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging that Nickey is coming from a place of love and a desire to provide for your kids' well-being.\n\nUltimately, the decision to adopt should be a collaborative one between you, Nickey, and your kids. You'll need to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and consider what's in the best interest of your children. It may be helpful to have a family meeting or therapy session to discuss this further and explore everyone's feelings and concerns.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution here.

I didn’t see anything in your post about how long you’ve been together, but it might be worth thinking about whether her suggestions are out of character for her, or whether it’s part of a larger pattern of immature behavior and intentional instigation of interpersonal drama… and whether that’s something she will mature out of or not.\n\nAnd I don’t know for sure, because maybe she’s heard a lot about them from you, but it kind of sounds to me like she’s making some negative assumptions about your parents based on ethnic stereotypes, which is… extremely problematic for someone in an interracial relationship. That isn’t really a maturity issue, IMO. But I’m white, so please ignore me if I’m off base here.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and the delicate situation you're in. It's great that you're considering your parents' feelings and wanting to approach this situation carefully.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for being honest with yourself and acknowledging your doubts about your faith. That takes a lot of courage, and it's great that you're thinking critically about your beliefs.\n\nRegarding your girlfriend's plan, I understand her frustration with the cultural expectations, but I agree with you that her approach might not be the most effective. While it's important to stand up for yourself and your relationship, being overly dramatic and provocative might not help your parents see things from your perspective.\n\nHere's a suggestion: why not have an open and honest conversation with your parents before your girlfriend arrives? You could explain to them that you're in a serious relationship and that you're bringing your partner to the wedding. Acknowledge that you know they might not approve, but you want to be honest with them and hope that they can understand your perspective.\n\nYou could also prepare them for the fact that your girlfriend is not Muslim, and that you're not planning on converting. This might help them understand that this isn't about rebelling against their values, but about you making your own choices and being happy.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your parents' reaction might not be immediate or easy to deal with. They might need time to process and adjust to the news. Being patient, empathetic, and understanding can go a long way in building bridges and creating a more positive atmosphere.\n\nAs for your girlfriend's plan to wear revealing clothes and get PDA in front of your parents, I understand her frustration, but I think it's best to avoid that. Instead, you could have a calm and respectful conversation with your parents, and then spend quality time with your girlfriend in private. This way, you can still show your love and affection for each other without making things more complicated.\n\nRemember, honesty is key in any relationship, including with your parents. Be genuine, respectful, and open-minded, and try to find a middle ground that works for everyone involved."

    "human": "Talk to your car/home/renters insurance agent about buying life insurance, it can save you money on all your policies.

    "base_reply": "If you're paying for life insurance out of pocket, here's some special knowledge to consider:\n\n1. **Understand the policy's cash value component**: Many whole life or universal life insurance policies have a cash value component that grows over time. You can borrow against this cash value or withdraw from it. Be aware of the interest rates, fees, and potential penalties for early withdrawals.\n2. **Review the policy's surrender charges**: If you decide to cancel your policy, you might face surrender charges, which can be a significant percentage of the policy's cash value. Understand these charges and plan accordingly.\n3. **Consider the tax implications**: The cash value growth and interest earned on your policy might be tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on it until you withdraw the funds. However, when you do withdraw, you'll need to pay taxes on the gains.\n4. **Keep accurate records**: Keep track of your premium payments, policy changes, and any withdrawals or loans. This will help you accurately report your insurance-related income and deductions on your tax return.\n5. **Consult a tax professional**: It's a good idea to consult a tax professional or financial advisor to ensure you're taking advantage of all the tax benefits available to you and complying with tax laws.\n\nAs for tax season, you'll typically need to report the following on your tax return:\n\n1. **Premium payments**: You can deduct the premiums you paid for life insurance as a medical expense on Schedule A of your tax return (Form 1040).\n2. **Withdrawals or loans**: Report any withdrawals or loans from your policy as income on your tax return. You may also need to pay taxes on the interest earned on these withdrawals or loans.\n3. **Cash value growth**: If you have a cash value component, you may need to report the interest earned on it as income.\n\nRemember to consult your policy documents and consult with a tax professional to ensure you're accurately reporting your life insurance-related income and deductions."

    "base_reply": "I completely understand your concern! It's indeed challenging to navigate situations where you need to express your thoughts or concerns to someone who holds a higher status than you. Here's a general framework that might help you approach these conversations with confidence and respect:\n\n1. **Prepare your thoughts**: Before talking to the person, take some time to gather your thoughts and organize your words. Make a mental (or written) list of the specific issues or concerns you want to address. Be clear about what you're trying to achieve and what you're asking for.\n2. **Start with a positive tone**: Begin the conversation by acknowledging the person's expertise or authority. Show appreciation for their role and express your respect for their time. This sets a positive tone for the conversation.\n3. **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Instead of attacking or criticizing the person, focus on the specific issue or behavior that's causing the problem. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example, \"I feel embarrassed when this happens\" instead of \"You always embarrass me.\"\n4. **Use non-accusatory language**: Frame your message in a way that avoids blame or aggression. Instead of saying \"You're doing it wrong,\" try \"I've noticed that this approach isn't working for me, could we explore alternative solutions?\"\n5. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to the other person's perspective and respond thoughtfully. Avoid interrupting or becoming defensive. Show that you're willing to listen and consider their views.\n6. **Seek solutions together**: Collaborate to find a mutually beneficial solution. Ask open-ended questions like \"What do you think about this?\" or \"How do you suggest we approach this?\" This shows that you value their input and are willing to work together.\n7. **Be open to feedback and compromise**: Be prepared to adjust your approach or consider alternative solutions. Remember that you're not trying to \"win\" an argument, but rather find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nSome specific phrases that might help you in these conversations:\n\n* \"I appreciate your expertise, but I'd like to share my thoughts on this matter...\"\n* \"I feel [emotion] when [specific situation] happens. Could we discuss alternative approaches?\"\n* \"I understand your perspective, but I'd like to propose an alternative solution...\"\n* \"I'm not trying to criticize, but I think we could improve [specific aspect]...\"\n* \"Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?\"\n\nRemember that effective communication is key. Approach these conversations with empathy, respect, and an open mind, and you'll be more likely to get your point across without coming across as rude or entitled."

Would you feel better if EVERYONE was thinking you were stupid, but kept their mouth shut? or, would you feel better if everyone respected you, except for one, but that one person laughed out loud at you. From what you're saying, it seems like you would rather have the former case where noone is actually, physically and audibly laughing at you. But I am sure this is not the case. I think you would feel more comfortable knowing that 99 pepole actually respect you and 1 is laughing at you, rather than 100 people thinking you are riddiculous, but is choosing to keep their mouth shut.

However, it's great that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to work on it.\n\nFor your issue with rehearsing in private, I'd suggest trying some gentle self-compassion and experimentation. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to get it \"right,\" try recording yourself speaking out loud. Yes, you read that right - record yourself! It can be a powerful way to build confidence and get used to the sound of your own voice. You can even try recording yourself speaking in front of a mirror, which can help you become more comfortable with your own body language and facial expressions.\n\nAs for the feeling of being watched, I'd recommend trying some mindfulness exercises to help you become more grounded in the present moment. When you feel that sensation, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're not actually being watched. It's just your brain's imagination playing tricks on you. Try to focus on the sensations in your body, like the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sensation of the air on your skin.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to challenge yourself to speak up in low-stakes situations, like with a close friend or family member. This can help you build confidence and get used to sharing your thoughts and opinions without worrying about being judged.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to make mistakes and stumble over your words. It's a normal part of the process, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on the value of sharing your thoughts and opinions, rather than the fear of being judged.\n\nHow do you feel about trying these strategies? Is there anything that resonates with you, or is there something else you'd like to add?"

In your case, almost a month is a decent amount of time, especially considering the importance of the person involved.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that everyone heals and processes emotions at their own pace.

Have you taken concrete steps to repair the damage and prevent similar mistakes in the future? Have you communicated openly and honestly about your regret and willingness to learn from the experience?\n\nIf you've done your part, it's time to focus on yourself and your own healing.

Make sure to take your time, and engage in some gentle, sensual touching and kissing before moving on to intercourse.\n3. **Physical discomfort**: If you're experiencing any physical discomfort or pain during sex, it can cause your body to tense up and lead to softening. Make sure to communicate with your partner about any discomfort you're feeling, and try to find a comfortable position.\n4. **Hormonal fluctuations**: Hormonal changes can affect erection quality.

If the kid opens up to you about his struggles, offer words of encouragement and support.

Consider the 4Cs:** When it comes to diamonds, the 4Cs (Carat, Color, Clarity, and Cut) play a significant role in determining the ring's quality and value. Make sure to understand what each C means and how it affects the overall appearance of the stone.\n\n**4. Research and compare:** Look at different options online, visit local jewelers, and consider online retailers. Compare prices, features, and reviews to find the best value for your budget.\n\n**5. Don't compromise on quality:** While it's tempting to save money, avoid compromising on the quality of the diamond or the craftsmanship. A lower-quality stone or poorly made setting can lead to future problems and disappointment.\n\n**6. Consider a custom design:** If you want a truly unique ring, consider working with a jeweler to design a custom piece. This can be a more expensive option, but it ensures you get exactly what you want.\n\n**7. Be prepared for the ask:** When you propose, be genuine and sincere. Express your feelings, and make sure your partner knows how much she means to you. The ring is just a symbol of your commitment; the love and thought behind it is what truly matters.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is finding a ring that your partner will love and cherish. Take your time, stay informed, and prioritize quality over cost. Good luck, and I hope everything goes smoothly!"

But the argument ended privately and everything seemed to get talked through and explained from both sides. \n\nThen, last night, 5-8 of her close friends from another “mental health” server she’s part of suddenly joined our group chat, and their sole purpose for joining was to read through our argument and then start harassing me, also in public. They called me bad shit, said that I’ve been abusing her for 3 years, all that she’s better off without me. \n\nI texted my girlfriend who was online at the time, she didn’t want to admit that she invited them, she said that she had no idea they’d do that, and apparently she was so stressed and overwhelmed she didn’t take action at all 30 minutes into the whole thing, even when she said she’d ban them. She outward didn’t want me to ban them from the server at first, because she doesn’t want to hurt her friends, said that she can’t control them and it’s their choice to say those things. But she seemed unphased about everything. \n\nI banned them all and left all public servers I’m on with her. Bullying is bullying and shit just happens, but I can’t help but still ask myself what else I’m not doing enough in our relationship and self reflect. I already go to therapy, I honestly try to pay so much attention to our relationship, but it doesn’t feel like it’s ever enough for her. \n\nI’m just not sure what to do, and the fact that I can’t trust her on not being involved in this makes it even harder. I feel like if I take action, I’ll blame her for her friends’ actions, but if I don’t, her friends will do this shit again, and they already have a long history of being toxic people. Any help appreciated.\n\nTL DR; Girlfriend’s friends bullied me on a group chat and she did nothing to try and stop it. I can’t help but feel like she was involved with this and it’s making my view on this muddled. I feel like if I confront her about it, I’m on the wrong because she wasn’t in control of her friends.

It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, hurt, and frustrated.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that you did the right thing by banning the toxic individuals from the server and leaving public servers with your girlfriend. You took action to protect yourself from further harm.\n\nRegarding your concerns about your girlfriend's involvement, it's natural to have doubts. However, it's crucial to separate her actions (or lack thereof) from her intentions. It's possible that she was genuinely unaware of her friends' plan to harass you, or she might have been overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nBefore confronting your girlfriend, take some time to reflect on your own feelings and concerns. Ask yourself:\n\n1. What specific behaviors or actions make you feel like your girlfriend is not doing enough in the relationship?\n2. Are there any underlying issues or patterns in your relationship that you've been trying to address?\n3. Have you communicated your concerns to your girlfriend in the past, and if so, how has she responded?\n\nWhen you're ready to talk to your girlfriend, approach the conversation calmly and specifically. Avoid accusatory language or tone, and focus on your feelings and experiences. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in the group chat. I felt really hurt and disrespected by the comments from your friends. I understand that you might not have been aware of their plan, but I wish you had taken action to stop the harassment or at least tried to intervene. I'm concerned that this might be a pattern in our relationship, and I feel like I'm not being heard or supported. Can we work together to find a way to address this and strengthen our communication?\"\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take time to reflect on your feelings. It's also essential to set boundaries and advocate for yourself in the relationship.\n\nLastly, consider seeking additional support from a therapist or a trusted friend or family member. They can help you process your emotions and provide guidance on navigating this challenging situation."

    "sentence": "Last week, my dad decided to leave his abusive girlfriend of 12 years so he's been staying with my boyfriend and I at our apartment. Throughout the week, my dad and I have been contacting his sister [62F] about his next steps, because my aunt and I came to an agreement that he would only stay with us for 2 weeks. \n\nA lot of different ideas came about (him keeping his job vs leaving his job, renting a room in a house to keep said job, etc) and from the sounds of it, he wants to fully retire and not have to work. I get it, he'll be 65 in July so he'll get his Old Age Pension, but he never made very much at that job to begin with, and with how expensive the rent is around here right now, I don't think he'll be able to afford an apartment on his own. \n\nMy boyfriend and I want to buy a house, but the market is so hot right now that we wouldn't be able to afford something that we actually want. My boyfriend has been looking at a house online for the past month or so that's about 45mins away from where we work, and he showed that to my dad the other night. The house has a second smaller house on the lot which was probably a garage that they converted, and my dad said that he would live there and pay us rent. My dad has a very dry sense of humor, but according to my boyfriend he wasn't joking. \n\nMy dad has had a lot of troubles with finances for his entire adult life, and he's gone bankrupt 3 times. I don't know if he has much of or any savings, because he didn't do any planning before deciding to leave girlfriend, so it was more of a lucky chance for him that I live in the city. \n\nIt also sounds like his sister doesn't really want him at her place either. She's been doing a lot to help him though, like arranging for him to see some rooms for rent in the city here, booking his plane ticket, and looking for places to rent in her city, but it sounds like she doesn't want him long term either. \n\nI love my dad to death, but before I got this news I didn't want him to stay more than two weeks anyway because he's a very loud personality. As in, what he thinks is a regular speaking voice is practically yelling. He also talks for hours on end, and I'm not exaggerating. You'll ask him one question and he'll go off on a tangent about his uncle back in the 1950s, so it's been very tiring not having any quiet time at home. His hygiene also isn't the best. He came to stay with us on Tuesday night and I practically had to usher him into the shower on Friday because the bedroom was starting to smell. \n\nI'm worried that he's going to stay with his sister for a while (which might be less than a month knowing him), and end up back in our spare bedroom, which my boyfriend and I don't want. My boyfriend figured out what he would say to my dad about renting from us (that we're not comfortable with it and we would treat him as if he were a tenant), but I don't know how I should approach the subject of him staying with us should it not work out when he leaves. \n\nTL;DR: My dad is trying to convince my boyfriend and I to let him live with us long term.\n\nUPDATE: I just wanted to give a huge thank you to everyone that upvoted and commented. I read every single reply and appreciate what everyone said. My dad is leaving tomorrow for his sister's, and my bf and I talked to him about him living with us in a \"granny suite\" type situation. He seemed a bit shocked that we said no to the idea, but I know it was the right choice for us. If my worry becomes a reality (that he comes back), I'll have a firm no ready. This has been the most stressful two weeks of my life, and I also just started a new job in March, so thank you again for all of your advice and stories.",

It's not ideal that he's had trouble with finances in the past, and it's possible that he may need some guidance and support to get back on his feet.\n\nRegarding your concerns about his living situation, it's important to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You mentioned that he's loud, talks for hours on end, and has hygiene issues - these are all valid concerns that can impact your quality of life. It's okay to set boundaries and communicate your needs to him.\n\nWhen you talk to your dad about his plans, it might be helpful to reiterate your initial agreement that he would stay with you for a maximum of two weeks.

It might be helpful to explore options with him, such as looking into social services or non-profit organizations that provide assistance to seniors.\n\nAs for the \"granny suite\" idea, it's understandable that you and your boyfriend didn't want to entertain it. It's important to prioritize your own needs and not compromise your living situation for anyone, including family members.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're prepared for the possibility that your dad might come back to stay with you in the future. Having a firm \"no\" ready will help you maintain your boundaries and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself during this time and prioritize your own needs. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being, even if it means having tough conversations with your dad."

First, kudos to you for acknowledging your lack of social life outside of work/school and wanting to change it!\n\nTo make friends and hang out during weekends, I'd recommend taking small steps outside your comfort zone. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Join a club or group that aligns with your interests**: Think about what you enjoy doing in your free time (e.g., hiking, gaming, reading, photography, etc.). Look for local groups, meetups, or online communities centered around those interests. This way, you'll be surrounded by people who share your passions.\n2. **Volunteer**: Helping others through volunteering can be a great way to meet like-minded individuals. You can search for opportunities at local charities, animal shelters, or environmental organizations.\n3. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, language course, or any other activity that sparks your curiosity. This will give you a chance to meet new people who share your interests.\n4. **Attend events and gatherings**: Look for events in your community, such as concerts, festivals, or sporting events. These can be great opportunities to meet new people in a casual setting.\n5. **Use online platforms**: Join Facebook groups or online forums related to your interests. You can also use apps like Meetup or Bumble BFF to connect with people in your area who share your hobbies.\n6. **Be open and genuine**: When meeting new people, be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. Share your interests and passions, and listen actively to others. This will help build connections and friendships.\n7. **Start small**: Don't feel pressured to try to make a dozen new friends at once. Start with one or two people and focus on building a strong connection with them. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually expand your social circle.\n8. **Be patient**: Building friendships takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep putting yourself out there, and eventually, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nRemember, making friends is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Focus on building meaningful connections rather than trying to collect a large number of acquaintances.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any specific activities or interests that you're considering exploring?"

Turns out she recently developed seizures and they found a brain tumor, although they don't know what type or her prognosis yet. She apparently is back home with her parents (she had been living out of state) and I would think she has a decent support system in place although understandably seems very scared.\n\nFor some context, we all lived in the same city about 6 years ago, and there was romantic interest on my boyfriend's part in both this ex and me at that time. He ended up choosing her, I moved on, then they later broke up, and then BF and I ended up talking again and got together. We have now been together almost 4 years, moved abroad together, bought a house together, and are talking about maybe trying for kids soon. Currently, our relationship is solid and I have no doubts about it. However, when we first got together I was particularly sensitive about this specific ex given the circumstances under which everything started. We had a lot of talks about our feelings and insecurities, worked through it, and are very much better for it. They had broken up on good terms but we agreed at that time that it was better for him to cut pretty much all contact with her, which he did.\n\nI'm struggling with how to deal with this situation with this brain tumor. I am trying to support my boyfriend as he is upset about his ex, who is a good person that he wouldn't wish anything bad for. And I know she's probably terrified and reaching out for any support she can find. But also think that it's not really his place to have a big part in her support system, and inappropriate for her to ask that of him. They've spent several hours on the phone over the last few days. He's been coming to bed late (time difference as we live abroad) and has missed plans we had because he was talking to her. If it matters, as far as he knows she is single right now.\n\nMy boyfriend also had a close friend who died of a brain tumor at a young age (early 20s) and is especially sensitive about things like this. He even mentioned to me that this conversation with his ex reminded him of finding out about his old friend's diagnosis years ago.\n\nI just hate seeing my boyfriend upset and resent her a bit for bringing him into this. However now that he knows he wants to be able to help, and I support him supporting her, but don't want it to bring undue burden on our relationship. It's already affected us even after a few days.\n\nHe stressed multiple times while we've talked about this that I was the most important person in his life, that he loves me, etc, and is aware of the fact that this could be a touchy area for me. I think I have moved past the sensitivity had specifically about this ex in the past, although this is also bothering me more than I'd like. I don't want to feel like I'm second priority, but also don't want to be an asshole with a really tragic situation.\n\nAny advice on how to best support my boyfriend through this without becoming resentful? Am I selfish for not wanting us to become deeply involved in this situation? At this point I am not sure how any of this is going to go, but it's such a complicated and sensitive situation and I'm not sure where to go from here. Should I just try to wait and see how it plays out?\n\nTLDR - Boyfriend's ex has newly diagnosed brain tumor and reached out to him for support, which I think was inappropriate.

It's essential to express your concerns and boundaries in a non-accusatory way. Let him know that you understand his desire to support his ex, but you're worried about the potential impact on your relationship.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Discuss with your boyfriend what boundaries you're comfortable with regarding his communication with his ex. You can suggest that they limit their conversations to specific topics, such as her health updates, and avoid getting into deep discussions or emotional support. This can help you feel more secure in your relationship.\n3. **Encourage professional support**: Suggest that his ex seek professional help from a therapist or support group. This can provide her with the emotional support she needs while also respecting your boyfriend's boundaries and avoiding any potential codependent dynamics.\n4. **Focus on your relationship**: Make time for activities and conversations that strengthen your bond with your boyfriend.

Let him know that you understand his empathy and compassion for her situation, but also reiterate your concerns about the impact on your relationship.\n6. **Monitor the situation**: Pay attention to how his conversations with his ex affect your relationship. If you notice that he's becoming increasingly distant or preoccupied, it may be necessary to have another conversation about boundaries and prioritizing your relationship.\n7. **Self-care**: Don't forget to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Make time for activities that bring you joy, practice self-care, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed.\n\nAs for whether you're being selfish for not wanting to become deeply involved in this situation, I'd say it's reasonable to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Your relationship with your boyfriend is important, and it's natural to want to protect it. It's not about being selfish; it's about being responsible and respectful of your own needs.\n\nUltimately, the key is to find a balance between supporting your boyfriend and maintaining your own emotional boundaries.

    "base_reply": "I can sense your frustration and hurt. It's understandable that you're still feeling upset, especially given the pattern of flakiness and selfishness you've experienced with this friend.\n\nWhile it's great that she apologized, it's also important to acknowledge that apologies can be hollow if they're not accompanied by changes in behavior. In this case, it seems like she's continued to prioritize her own desires over your plans and feelings.\n\nBefore deciding what to do, ask yourself: What do you hope to achieve by further explaining your feelings to her? Are you seeking closure, a deeper understanding, or a change in her behavior?\n\nIf it's the latter, it might be worth having a calm and specific conversation with her about how her actions affect you. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I appreciate your apology, but I wanted to follow up on what happened with New Year's. I understand that things came up, but it was really disappointing to be stood up and have to spend the evening alone because of your plans changing. I want to emphasize that it's not just about the money or the event itself, but about the feeling of being prioritized last-minute and having to adjust my plans accordingly. I value our friendship, but I need to feel like I'm a priority in your life too. Can we work on finding a better balance in our plans and communication moving forward?\"\n\nHowever, if you're mainly seeking to express your anger or frustration, it might not be the most constructive approach. Venting your emotions can be cathartic, but it might not lead to a meaningful resolution or change in her behavior.\n\nConsider taking some time to reflect on your feelings and priorities before deciding what to do next. You might also want to think about what you're willing to accept in a friendship and what boundaries you need to set to feel respected and valued."

I currently gym 4 times a week and also do other physical activities in-between, such as hiking on weekends etc.\n\nI regularly hit all my physical goals and am really proud of my progress.

I didnt pay too much attention to it at the time and told him that I'm happy with my current progress and schedule.\n\nOver the last few days his comments have escalated and he's regularly saying things to try convince me to go more often like \"I love your ass, let's get it phatter\" and other comments indicating that we would have better sex if I gummed more. I love him to bits but his obsession with body sculpting me is becoming too much. \n\nI don't want to lose him, please help?\n\nTL;DR How do I navigate my boyfriend being repeatedly pushy about going to gym more often than I would like to?",

It's great that you're already meeting your goals and feeling confident.\n\nNow, let's tackle the issue at hand. It's understandable that you don't want to lose your boyfriend, but it's essential to address his pushy comments and set boundaries. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with him: Choose a relaxed setting where you both feel comfortable, and express your feelings in a non-accusatory tone. Be specific about how his comments make you feel, using \"I\" statements. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about your comments on my gym routine. When you say things like 'let's get it phatter,' it makes me feel like you're more focused on my physical appearance than my overall well-being. I understand you're trying to be supportive, but it's making me feel uncomfortable and a bit self-conscious. Can we find a way to support each other's goals and priorities without making me feel like I'm not good enough?\"\n\n2. Set clear boundaries: Make it clear that you're happy with your current routine and don't feel the need to increase your gym sessions. You can say something like:\n\n\"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm happy with my current schedule and progress. I don't feel like I need to go more often to feel confident or sexy. Let's focus on supporting each other's goals and priorities, rather than putting pressure on me to change my routine.\"\n\n3. Reiterate your love and appreciation: Let him know that you love and appreciate him, but his comments are becoming a source of stress and discomfort for you. You can say something like:\n\n\"I love you and appreciate your support, but I need you to understand that your comments are making me feel uncomfortable. I want us to be able to communicate openly and honestly about our goals and priorities. Let's find a way to do that without putting pressure on each other.\"\n\nRemember to listen to his perspective and try to understand where he's coming from. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact his words are having on you. By having an open and honest conversation, you can work together to find a solution that respects your boundaries and prioritizes your relationship.\n\nLastly, be prepared for the possibility that he might not immediately change his behavior. If that's the case, it may be essential to re-evaluate whether this relationship is healthy and aligned with your values."

Additionally, her city currently has a lockdown and she still prioritizes staying in with roommates over simply calling me for 5 minutes. Like I get her wanting to hang out, but hanging out till 1 in the morning and saying you are tired and can’t FaceTime after promising? \n\nIt feels like she’s spending no effort to make time for me. I get that she needs to make friends abroad and is living in a new city and having a grand adventure but I’m miserable. I’ve explained this to her many times, and she’s been better about it. But she still kinda prioritizes other things which sucks. \n\nShe basically knows I’m miserable and can’t even eat but still doesn’t give me attention.   Recently, I told her that I would come visit her from the 3rd -21st. At first she was happy and excited about the news.\n\n I brought it up two days later and she says that it’s not happening because her roommates don’t want a stranger sleeping with them for 2 weeks which I get. She wanted me to just come for one week. I offered to buy an Airbnb for 2 weeks for us to stay in(which would be expensive I’m not too well off) and she said no, and then struggled to say that she didn’t want me there basically. She said she needed to be alone and explore abroad, and that we aren’t a married couple.   \n\nIt just felt really strange for her to reject my offer of coming to see her for a while extra week. Also felt like her excuse for it was complete bs, given that she had reasoning for not wanting me to come, and her roommates not being cool with it was definitely a front. She continually said the reason that she didn’t want me to come wasn’t boys, and that she wanted to be alone and able to explore:.\n\nI felt slapped in the face and told her so, especially after communicating to her how lonely I felt and how much I missed her.

It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and uncertain about your girlfriend's priorities and intentions.\n\nFirstly, it's completely understandable that you're feeling lonely and miss her. It's normal to feel that way when someone you care about is physically distant. It's also reasonable to expect some effort from your partner to make time for you, especially considering you're recovering from surgery.\n\nRegarding the visit plan, it's interesting that she initially seemed excited, then rejected your offer, and only changed her mind after you expressed your feelings and threatened to break up. This behavior does raise some red flags. While it's possible she was genuinely hesitant about your visit, it's also possible she was using her roommates as an excuse to avoid your visit.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to prioritize their own experiences and desires over their partner's needs, especially during a time of personal growth and adventure. However, it's essential to recognize that your feelings and needs matter too.\n\nBefore you make any decisions, take some time to reflect on your own feelings and priorities. Ask yourself:\n\n1.

How important is it for you to feel like your partner is making an effort to prioritize you and your relationship?\n3.

I understand you're having an amazing time abroad, but I feel like I'm not a priority for you right now. I offered to visit for two weeks, and you initially seemed excited, but then rejected my offer. I felt really hurt and rejected. Can we talk about what's going on and find a way to prioritize our relationship during this time?\"\n\nRemember that you deserve to feel seen, heard, and prioritized in your relationship.

It's great that you're taking the initiative to help your wife and children, and it's admirable that you're pursuing your own goals.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your wife's constant criticism might be a sign of her own stress, anxiety, or feelings of overwhelm. It's not uncommon for partners to take out their frustrations on each other, especially when they feel like they're shouldering the bulk of the responsibilities.\n\nTo address this issue, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your wife. Instead of focusing on what you're doing \"wrong,\" try to understand what's driving her behavior. Ask her how she's feeling, what's causing her stress, and what she needs from you to feel supported. Be specific and empathetic in your approach, and avoid becoming defensive.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you can't control your wife's reactions or emotions, but you can control how you respond to them. When she criticizes you, try to remain calm and acknowledge her concerns, but also set clear boundaries and communicate your own needs. You can say something like, \"I understand you're feeling stressed, but I'm doing my best with my schedule and responsibilities. I need some understanding and support from you as well.\"\n\nRegarding your specific situation, it's great that you're taking care of the kids and helping with household chores. However, it might be helpful to have a more structured approach to tasks and responsibilities. Consider creating a shared schedule or to-do list with your wife, so you're both on the same page and can work together more efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, it might be beneficial to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This could be as simple as taking a walk, reading a book, or practicing yoga. When you're feeling more relaxed and centered, you'll be better equipped to handle conflicts and communicate more effectively with your wife.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. Acknowledge and learn from them, and move forward. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the progress you're making rather than the perceived shortcomings.\n\nRemember, relationships are a two-way street, and it's essential to find a balance between giving and receiving. By communicating openly, setting boundaries, and prioritizing self-care, you can work towards a more harmonious and fulfilling relationship with your wife."

This way, you can connect with others who share your passion without feeling overwhelmed by in-person interactions.\n2. **Find a study group or study buddy**: Since you're a junior, you probably have a decent understanding of your coursework.

This can be a great way to build connections with like-minded individuals.\n3. **Attend events, but don't feel obligated**: When you do attend events, don't feel pressured to stay for the entire event or engage in conversations that make you uncomfortable. Take small steps, and if you need to leave early, that's okay.\n4. **Be open and honest**: When meeting new people, be open about your social anxiety and your interests.

It's great that they reached out and added you on social media, but it's essential to approach this situation thoughtfully. Here are some tips to help you reconnect with this person:\n\n1. **Take your time**: Don't rush into reaching out. Take a few days or even a week to process your emotions and thoughts about reconnecting. Consider what you want to achieve from reconnecting and what you're hoping to get out of it.\n2. **Reflect on your past relationship**: Think about the reasons why you drifted apart. Was it due to a specific incident, or did life get busy? Reflecting on your past relationship can help you understand what you want to work on or avoid in your future interactions.\n3. **Start with a casual message**: Send a friendly, casual message on Snapchat or social media to break the ice. Keep it light and brief, like \"Hey, it's been a while! How have you been?\" or \"What's new with you?\"\n4. **Keep the initial conversation casual**: The first conversation should be easy-going and low-pressure. Avoid deep or heavy topics, and focus on catching up on each other's lives.\n5. **Be honest and authentic**: When you do reconnect, be genuine and authentic. Share your life updates, but also be willing to listen to theirs. Avoid trying to recreate the past or pretend everything is the same as it was 8 years ago.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Reconnecting doesn't mean you have to rekindle the same level of friendship you had before. Set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you're not comfortable with the level of contact or the topics they want to discuss, it's okay to politely set limits.\n7. **Meet in person (if you both feel comfortable)**: If you both feel like meeting in person is a good idea, plan a casual meetup. This can help you gauge each other's intentions and see if the connection is still there.\n8. **Be patient and flexible**: Reconnecting takes time, and it may not happen overnight. Be patient and flexible, and remember that it's okay if things don't go exactly as planned.\n\nRemember, reconnecting with someone from your past is a process, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being throughout. Take things slowly, and focus on building a genuine connection rather than trying to recapture the past."

    "base_reply": "Setting a personal goal can be a powerful way to focus your efforts and achieve success. Here's a step-by-step process to help you set a goal and make it more achievable:\n\n1. **Identify your goal**: Take some time to reflect on what you want to achieve. What's important to you? What's been nagging at you? What do you want to improve or accomplish? Be specific and honest with yourself.\n2. **Make it SMART**: Make your goal Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, instead of \"I want to be healthier,\" a SMART goal would be \"I want to lose 10 pounds in the next 3 months by exercising for 30 minutes, 3 times a week, and eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.\"\n3. **Write it down**: Writing down your goal makes it more concrete and helps you commit to it. You can write it on a sticky note, in a journal, or use a goal-setting app.\n4. **Break it down into smaller steps**: Divide your goal into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you stay focused and motivated. For example, if your goal is to write a book, your smaller steps might include setting a daily writing schedule, outlining chapters, and editing drafts.\n5. **Create an action plan**: Identify the specific actions you'll take to achieve your goal. For example, if your goal is to learn a new language, your action plan might include setting aside 30 minutes each day to practice, using language learning apps, and finding a language exchange partner.\n6. **Track your progress**: Keep track of your progress by setting milestones, using a planner or app, or sharing your goal with a friend or accountability partner. This will help you stay motivated and adjust your approach as needed.\n7. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress and adjust your goal as needed. Life changes, and your goal might need to adapt to those changes.\n\nThere are many apps and tools that can help you set and track your goals, such as:\n\n* Habitica: A habit-tracking app that gamifies your goals and tasks\n* Strides: A goal-setting app that helps you set and track goals, with a focus on habit-forming\n* Goalmap: A goal-setting app that helps you set and track goals, with a focus on visualization and progress tracking\n* Evernote: A note-taking app that allows you to set reminders and track your progress\n\nRemember, setting a goal is just the first step. The key to achieving it is to stay consistent, patient, and flexible. Good luck!"

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and frustrations. It sounds like you're feeling stuck between being a good person and dealing with a roommate who's not pulling their weight.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you did make a mistake by not having a lease in place before she moved in. It's crucial to have a clear agreement in writing, especially when it comes to rent and responsibilities.\n\nRegarding the car issue, it's understandable that you're concerned about not receiving rent payments. However, it's essential to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Since she's an Uber and Lyft driver, her car is her primary means of income. You could consider having a conversation with her about the situation, focusing on the impact it's having on both of you.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. Schedule a calm and respectful conversation with your roommate to discuss the situation. Be specific about your concerns and how her not paying rent is affecting you.\n2. Ask her to provide a plan for when she expects to get her car fixed and when she can start making rent payments again.\n3. Consider offering help or resources to find alternative transportation options for her, such as public transportation or ride-sharing services.\n4. Reiterate the importance of open communication and finding a solution that works for both of you.\n\nRegarding the other issues you mentioned, such as her leaving lights on and playing video games all day, it's essential to address these concerns as well. You could mention how these habits are affecting your own life and the shared space.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not obligated to be a hero and absorb all the costs. You can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to the situation.\n\nLastly, since you mentioned you're considering a month-by-month lease, it might be a good idea to revisit that agreement and make sure it includes clauses for rent payment, utilities, and responsibilities. This will help establish clear expectations and boundaries for both of you.\n\nRemember, being a good person doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your own well-being. You deserve to be treated fairly and respectfully, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs."

The start of our relationship was fine but we’ve been having recurring fights over the same topic every once in a while - revealing traits to my boyfriend which I wasn’t as aware of prior. \n\nMy boyfriend has insecurity and trust issues from his previous relationships (was cheated on) and often projects this insecurity into me. He does this by sulking whenever I say out with people / colleagues he doesn’t know and also giving me attitude when I go to a party/club with friends. I understand how his reactions are rooted in prior experiences but he constantly tells me that he can’t help but feel this way / needs to accuse me of not prioritizing him. Our most recent fight, he accused me of neglecting him and being not aware of how lonely he feels - when I attended 2 professional events this week back to back and didn’t call him at night like we usually do. We then had a huge argument where I tried to tell him that I can’t read his mind / I can’t give up other parts of my life just to give him a bit more attention and I need him to not accuse or criticise me whenever he feels lonely / wants more affection to compensate for me being busier than usual. \n\nOur argument ended with him saying these statements\n\n“I think you’re asking too much of me. When I’m lonely because you don’t have time I have to describe my feelings objectively using inclusive language… don’t you get that I’m upset. How can I just use positive and inclusive language…”\n\n“Ok but why it is just my responsibility to feel less lonely and look after myself”\n\n“I will always and only give as much as you because I hate feeling like I care more”\n\nIs this a red flag? He also has an extreme hyper fixation on “who’s to blame” and the fact that he has a “right/is entitled to” feeling not lonely / being secure (which i agree with fundamentally, just the language makes me uncomfortable and affects the power dynamic of the conversation. I communicated to him that I’ll try my best to fulfil his needs but i’m not going to be able to cater all the time because of my other commitments. And now it feels like he’s sulky and being petty (doesn’t say goodnight or good mornings first, silent treatment etc) \n\nAny advice is appreciated and I can provide more context if needed\n\nTldr; Boyfriend has insecurity issues and gets really lonely / anxious attachment when I have a busy week.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your relationship and seeking advice. It's great that you're aware of your boyfriend's past experiences and are trying to understand where his reactions come from.\n\nWhile it's natural to have some degree of insecurity and anxiety in any relationship, the red flags I see here are:\n\n1. Blame-shifting: Your boyfriend is placing the responsibility of his feelings on you, saying it's your job to \"fix\" his loneliness and make him feel secure. This can be a sign of an unhealthy dynamic where he's not taking ownership of his emotions and is instead expecting you to change to meet his needs.\n2. Entitlement: His statements about being \"entitled\" to not feel lonely or secure can be concerning. No one is entitled to feel a certain way, and it's not your responsibility to guarantee his emotional well-being.\n3. Lack of emotional regulation: His reaction to feeling lonely is to become sulky and give you the silent treatment. This can be a sign of emotional immaturity and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms.\n4. Power dynamics: The way he phrases his concerns, using \"inclusive language\" and making you feel like you're not meeting his needs, can create an imbalance in the relationship. This kind of language can be manipulative and controlling.\n\nIt's essential to have open and honest conversations with your boyfriend about these issues. You've already started by expressing your concerns and needs, which is a great step. However, I would suggest framing the conversation differently to help him understand your perspective:\n\n1. Acknowledge his feelings: Validate his emotions and let him know you understand he feels lonely and insecure. However, it's crucial to set boundaries and clarify that it's not your responsibility to fix his emotions.\n2. Communicate your needs: Reiterate that you value your relationship and want to make time for him, but you also have other commitments and priorities. Explain that you need him to understand and respect your boundaries.\n3. Establish a compromise: Work together to find ways to address his feelings of loneliness and insecurity in a more balanced and healthy way. This might involve setting aside dedicated time for each other, engaging in activities he enjoys, or practicing empathy and active listening.\n4. Set consequences: Make it clear that if he continues to use sulking and silent treatment as a way to get attention, it's not acceptable and may lead to further conflict.\n\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and communication. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries to maintain a healthy dynamic. If you feel like you're consistently walking on eggshells or being manipulated, it may be worth reevaluating the relationship."

Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.\n\nToday, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)\n\nShe says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.\n\nAm I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to? Should I just leave?",
    "human": "As a woman who has struggled with these feelings in the past in relationships (as in i was wanting my partner to block IG girls) even if you unfollow these girls there will always be something else or someone else that will make her insecure and it will just cycle again.

I have matured from these insecurities after therapy but honestly medication was the biggest help for my anxiety/self esteem. Try and explain your point of view with understanding and sensitivity. If she isn’t willing to trust you and to begin to self love it will be impossible for her to maintain a healthy relationship with you or anyone else.

It's great that you're willing to address this issue and have a conversation about it.\n\nNow, let's break it down. Your girlfriend's anxiety is a significant aspect of your relationship, and you've been trying to support her. However, it's essential to recognize that her request is not just about her anxiety, but also about her trust issues and insecurities.\n\nWhile it's understandable that she might feel uncomfortable with you following other girls on Instagram, it's crucial to distinguish between what's reasonable and what's not. You've made it clear that you don't interact with these girls online, and you're not trying to hide anything. This is a reasonable boundary.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that your girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might be feeling insecure or threatened by the mere presence of these girls on your Instagram, even if you're not interacting with them. It's essential to have an open and empathetic conversation about this.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of simply refusing to unfollow the girls, consider having a compromise. You could explain to your girlfriend that you understand her concerns and are willing to make some changes to alleviate her anxiety. Perhaps you could unfollow a few of the girls, but not all of them, and have a discussion about what specific actions you're willing to take to make her feel more comfortable.\n\nHowever, it's also important to set boundaries and communicate your own needs. You mentioned that you don't want to be controlled or dictated what you can and can't do on social media. You should express this to your girlfriend and reiterate that you're not doing anything wrong by following these girls.\n\nIf your girlfriend is unwilling to work with you on finding a compromise or is still pressuring you to unfollow everyone, it might be a sign that she's not willing to work on her own issues and insecurities. In that case, it may be worth reevaluating the relationship and considering whether it's healthy for you to be in.\n\nRemember, relationships are about mutual respect, trust, and communication. If your girlfriend is not willing to listen to your concerns and work with you to find a solution, it might be time to reassess the relationship and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nLastly, don't forget to take care of yourself during this conversation. It's okay to prioritize your own feelings and needs, and it's essential to maintain a healthy sense of self-worth."

Here are a few strategies:\n\n1. **Acknowledge their point**: Respond with something like, \"I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your input.\" This shows you're listening and valuing their perspective.\n2. **Set a boundary**: If the conversation is getting off-track, you can say, \"I appreciate your insights, but I'd like to move back to the main topic. Can we focus on [specific topic]?\" or \"I understand your point, but I'd like to move forward with the discussion.\"\n3. **Use a gentle redirect**: Try saying, \"I think we've covered that point well enough. Let's explore [new topic] instead.\" This helps steer the conversation back on track without dismissing the other person's input.\n\nRemember, admitting you're wrong takes courage, but it's a crucial part of building trust and credibility. By being open to feedback and corrections, you're showing that you're willing to learn and grow, which is a huge strength in any relationship or situation.\n\nLastly, don't worry too much about losing credibility. People respect honesty and humility more than they do perfection. By being willing to admit your mistakes, you'll actually build stronger relationships and earn more respect in the long run."

    "sentence": "Throwaway account here for obvious reasons. I’m sorry if this post is super disjointed, there’s alot going on here.\n\nThe sort of underlying basis of my post is the question: How do you know you’re ready for marriage or further commitment? Please keep this in mind as you read my post, as I think that is what I’m struggling with mostly, and there are underlying themes of:\n\n1. How do you know when to continue working on a relationship or move on?\n2. How to continue to allow for personal and professional development and support one another with this in a relationship?\n\nMy (29M) partner (30F) of 3.5 years has recently expressed a lot more interest in topics of marriage, kids, and general life planning, especially as many of our close friends and coworkers have become recently engaged or are having weddings in the next 1-2 years. I’m very supportive of having these conversations, and realize we’re both at that age of needing to talk about these things to plan for the future together and continue to make sure our goals are compatible. That said, I guess I just feel like I don’t know how to approach these conversations, as I’m very clear with my partner that I’m neither ready to get married, and am uncertain about having kids. I guess I’m looking for tools, techniques, advice, communications aids, etc. to help me, and my partner to continue to have these conversations.\n\nMy partner feels essentially ready for the commitment of both marriage and kids – which, I’m really grateful of and I do feel her love, but I just can’t reciprocate those feelings of commitment at the moment. I do understand that her biological clock is limited, and she's getting to the age of needing to find her partner if she wants to have kids.\n\nI love her and care for her deeply. We have a great, stable relationship. We share many common interests, friends, a good social life, and frequent intimacy. We’ve known one another for eight years, dating for 3.5, and have lived together for 2. That said, despite being a bit older I still feel like we are developing as people and still very much stumbling our way around into our careers. Unlike our friends who are getting married, who are now well into PhD programs, med school, law schools, etc, and have stable careers and jobs and are buying homes.\n\nI guess I just view this issue of marriage, and further commitment of kids as being contingent on having a relatively stable career and job first. Neither of us has that – in fact, my partner is in the process of applying to graduate schools. In and of itself, that would put her in a significant amount of student debt, and require 2-4 additional years of schooling before being in her career. I’m in a similar situation, still very much figuring out what my career is after switching several different fields to the point that I haven’t really felt ‘grounded’ in any one area yet. I view marriage as being mostly for the benefit of having children, and my views on children are very clouded by the immense cost of living today, and general pessimistic outlook on climate change. I think I do want kids, but I don't really envision myself being in a comfortable financial position until probably the age of 36-40 when it may be too late for my partner.\n\nTo this point - I just feel like we are still doing a lot of personal and professional development, and who knows what directions that will pull us in. Just as an example, if my partner had to move across the country, I honestly don’t know if I would move with her, because I wouldn’t want to stifle my own career and leave my community. If the situation were reversed I wouldn’t want to ask her to move across the country with me either at the detriment of her own career and personal development. This example is a bit fabricated, because we take these things into consideration with one another when making decisions, but it's not unforeseeable.\n\nMoreover, while our relationship is overall really great, this relationship is more or less the first committed relationship that I’ve had where I’ve actually considered marriage or kids. My previous relationships never matured to the point of discussing a future together. I feel comfortable in this relationship, and love my partner, but I’m having a hard time distinguishing being comfortable with knowing that I want this in the future with absolute certainty. I’m happy, don’t get me wrong, but in a contented sort of way where I love my partner, the time we spend together, the conversations we have, taking our dog for walks, going on dates, getting ice cream, visiting our respective families, etc. The thought of that being the sort of status quo so to speak for the duration of a marriage (let's assume long term) feels comfortable to me in the way that sitting by a fire is comfortable. It’s warm and familiar with some excitement and sparks and requires work to keep going. It's a contented happiness rather than a sort of, wake up ecstatic each day sort of way (which I absolutely realize is WAY too high of an expectation). And the thought of this continuing for 20+ years... I honestly don't really know how that sits with me (commitment issues). I think I would feel this way with virtually any partner.\n\nI have full confidence that my partner and I could have a loving, supportive partnership and know that successful marriages involve a lot of hard work, good communication, and compromise rather than this ideal relationship of her being the ‘one’. But, I sometimes wonder if I would benefit from further personal development and exploration. Whether in my career, travels (short term), and at the extreme end wondering if maybe there is someone more compatible for me.\n\nI think where I have a hard time with this is personal development doesn’t need to be mutually exclusive of being in a relationship (with the exception of exploring other relationships). Again – where is the balance of continuing to develop as an individual whether personally or professionally and supporting one another in that. I also don’t want this concern to be interpreted as keeping her as a ‘backup’, because I feel like we have it pretty good now – but would I benefit from the perspective of not having the relationship that I do now? At the core, I guess I just have commitment issues and they lead to feelings of wondering if there is ‘more’. I am pursuing counseling for this, and we have spoken about couples counseling but haven’t yet gone.\n\nAdditionally is this lingering question of how to know when a relationship should and can be worked on, or best moved on from? My partner is a great partner in most regards, but we definitely have things to work on, both individually and as a couple. None are blatantly red flags for me but have given me pause. For instance, I generally pull more weight around the house in terms of cooking, cleaning, etc, and she isn't the best with money and personal accounting. When the thought of kids comes up, I’m sure those issues will be exacerbated. Even in the context of no kids, I know she would be receptive of having to work on these things. Likewise, I’m sure that she has some concerns or hesitations about some of my behaviours, and I would also reciprocate trying to improve myself for her.\n\nTLDR: I (29M) am having commitment issues with my partner (30F) when we broach the topic of marriage or kids. She is a fantastic partner and we have a loving and supportive relationship, but I still have cold feet when thinking about the future. My concerns are:\n\n1. We are still developing as individuals despite being a bit older (pursuing more education, not really in our careers).\n2. I’m having ‘grass is greener’ syndrome. This is my first real committed relationship that I’ve actually strongly considered marriage, but I can’t help but wonder if there is someone more suitable for me. I hate modern media for selling the idea of there being the ‘perfect’ person for you but that's where my mind is going.\n3. How do you know when issues are able to be worked on in the relationship or if you’re better off moving on?\n\nI can't help but think of that little scene from Master of None when Dev and Rachel are imagining themselves at the alter and all the doubts they have about it (though perhaps with a bit less pessimistic view).",
    "human": "Dude, cutting through that long post - you don't want to commit to her at this stage any further than you have. \n\nYou dont need tools to discuss the future you dont actually want at this point in time  - you just need to tell her and accept whatever decision she makes off of the back of it.\n\nIts disrespectful to stay with her until events arise that means you will put yourself and your career first. There is nothing wrong with focusing on yourself, just dont string her along with it.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, what a thoughtful and introspective post! I'm glad you're seeking guidance on this complex and personal topic.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not alone in your feelings. Many people struggle with commitment, and it's okay to take your time to figure things out. It's great that you're considering your partner's feelings and desires, as well as your own.\n\nRegarding your concerns:\n\n1. You're right that personal and professional development are crucial, especially at your age. It's normal to still be figuring things out, and it's great that you're acknowledging this. You might consider having open conversations with your partner about your goals, aspirations, and fears. This can help you both understand each other's perspectives and work together to support each other's growth.\n2. The \"grass is greener\" syndrome is a common phenomenon, especially with the media's portrayal of relationships. It's essential to recognize that everyone has their flaws, and no one is perfect. You might consider focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that bring you joy, rather than constantly comparing yourself to others.\n3. As for knowing when to work on issues in a relationship or move on, it's crucial to communicate openly with your partner. You've already mentioned that you're considering couples counseling, which is a great step. Remember that relationships involve growth, compromise, and work. It's normal to have disagreements and issues, but it's how you address them that matters.\n\nSome advice I'd like to offer:\n\n* Practice self-reflection: Take time to understand your feelings, values, and priorities. What do you want from a relationship? What are your non-negotiables? What are your goals, and how do they align with your partner's?\n* Communicate openly with your partner: Share your thoughts, fears, and desires with your partner. Be honest and vulnerable, but also be respectful of their feelings and perspectives.\n* Focus on the present: Rather than worrying about the future, focus on the present moment. What are you grateful for in your relationship? What are you enjoying? What are you proud of?\n* Consider a \"pause\" rather than a \"no\": If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate. This doesn't mean you're giving up on the relationship, but rather taking time to reflect on what you want and need.\n* Remember that relationships are a journey: It's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers now. Focus on building a strong foundation with your partner, and the future will unfold naturally.\n\nRemember, commitment is a process, and it's okay to take your time. You're not alone in this, and there are many resources available to help you navigate your feelings and concerns."

Find a topic or activity that sparks your curiosity, and participate in it. This will help you connect with others who share similar interests.\n2. **Be genuine and authentic**: Don't try to fake it or pretend to be someone you're not. Be yourself, and let your personality shine through. People are more likely to be drawn to someone who is authentic and genuine.\n3. **Find a common ground**: Look for shared experiences, hobbies, or interests that can serve as a conversation starter. This can be a great way to build connections with others.\n4. **Be patient and persistent**: Making friends takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep attending group events, participating in activities, and engaging with others.\n5. **Join a smaller group or club**: If the large group feels overwhelming, consider joining a smaller club or organization that aligns with your interests. This can be a great way to meet like-minded people.\n\nAs for differentiating a hard-working person from someone who's just going to college for government aid, here are some signs to look out for:\n\n1. **Consistent effort and dedication**: A hard-working person will typically demonstrate a consistent effort and dedication to their studies, extracurricular activities, or work.

That's something to be proud of!\n\nNow, let's break down your concerns:\n\n1. The lack of stability: It's natural to crave a sense of security and stability, especially when you're already shouldering a lot of responsibility as a single parent. Having a partner to share the load can be a huge relief.\n2. Financial struggles: Living on a single income can be tough, and the added pressure of meeting your child's needs can be overwhelming.

The desire for help around the house: Let's be honest, having someone to share household responsibilities can be a huge blessing!\n\nHowever, before considering settling for someone you don't truly love, I want to ask you to reflect on what you're really looking for in a partner. Are you looking for someone who can provide stability and financial security, but also genuinely connect with you on an emotional level?

    "sentence": "This is a throwaway account. So, for context: I've been with my partner for 3 years and 5 months now. We've lived together since 2020. I've known my best friend since childhood and I love her very much. We've always been very open with each other and when she was with her ex (for some reason) they'd talk a lot about their sex life with me and my partner, and this still went on even when they broke up (she'd bring up the topic to me and my partner every time her ex was mentioned, talking about how he didn't really satisfy her, even though he'd always say he was very good and so on...).\n\nLast year I started to notice my partner was looking at my best friend a certain way, and was acting a bit off around her, so I confronted him by asking him if he liked her after I noticed this was frequent (about 2 to 3 months of this behavior). He was beating around the bush, so I got desperate and as he was just going to give him an answer I said: \"If you like her, I'm going to dump you.\" As soon as I said that,(obviously) he denied it. We had a talk about 3 days after that where he asked me to forgive him for acting weird, and cried for me to give him a chance. So we're still together. I told my best friend about it because I just felt awkward around her for a bit, but after I took some time apart, I was able to hang out with her without issues.\n\nEven though we've been together since, I've still had the feeling that my partner didn't give me all the information and that made me feel very anxious. I would ask him at least every now and then if he was honest to me that day because something still felt off to me, and he would always deny it and even went as far as to say: \"If you keep talking about this and don't move on, I will have to leave you,\" but we'd work through that.\n\n I usually didn't feel weird when they were around, but lately I noticed my best friend would make comments about her sex life when my boyfriend came around us even when it wasn't on topic. For example, we were talking about my mother's friend dying and when my boyfriend came to the kitchen to get something she quickly said, \"Anyway, my fwb says I'm very good when I'm on top of him,\" and I just find that very weird... \n\nAnyway, this and the fact that after that she acted weird made me feel bad and remember the topic. She decided to stay the night suddenly (I would not say no to her, but she didn't give me a concrete reason). So when she left the next day she was teary eyed and didn't say goodbye to my partner. Logically, this couldn't have anything to do with him, but I felt something was off, so I asked him again (Still don’t know why she was teary eyed, but I spent all night awake with my partner while he worked on his thesis so I know he didn’t do anything to her. But I still wanted reassurance.)\n\nI asked him if he liked her, he said no. I asked if he did something to her, he said no, and he said that if I'm doubting him, I might as well doubt her as well. I told him I doubt both of them (taking into consideration what I wrote about the random sexual comments) and he said we’d talk that same night.\n\nAt night he said that since I revealed I didn’t trust her either, he’d be honest: Basically, since she’d always bring her sex life up, he started having sexual dreams about her frequently for about 2 months and started to like her and even considered breaking up with me to try having sex with her if he ever felt too attracted, but after I confronted him, he said he realized that the whole situation was a mistake and he didn’t want to be with anyone else sexually or romantically. He claims that after the confrontation he hasn’t felt anything towards her and that he realized he was just confused bc he heard too much about her sex life and got curious. After telling me all this, he begged me for a second chance and I said yes but I still feel betrayed, even though he didn’t do or try anything… but I’m confused wether this is to be considered cheating/red flag or not. One of my other best friends told me that it’s normal to feel attracted to someone else when in a relationship, but this hasn’t happened to me so I’m trying to understand.\n\nI’m still trying to process things, and I don’t want to break up if it’s really normal, but I do feel betrayed bc he felt like that towards her and she’s my best friend. What should I do? Is this really normal?\n\nEDIT: \n\nTLDR: Partner admitted to having wet dreams  about and liking my best friend for about 2 months last year. I feel betrayed even though he didn’t act on it, so I’d like to know if this is normal and should give the relationship a shot…\n\nEDIT 2: \n\nSince this seems to be a very common comment, I want to make this clear: I’m reevaluating BOTH my relationship with my partner and my friendship with my best friend. I have taken the decision to give my partner a chance for now while I think things through and we talked about boundaries I have to apply with my best friend (if I decide to keep her in my life). \n\nI never defended my friend’s actions, but I haven’t confronted her about them yet because I just recently started to notice this behavior.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nSince this also seems to be a very common comment, I also want to make this clear: I’m NOT mad at my partner for having the dreams. I’m hurt because I could clearly see he liked her and he denied it repeatedly until I disclosed to him I didn’t trust her and I just wanted to know if this was a common thing long time relationships go through.",

It's normal for people to experience attraction to others, but it's how they choose to act on those feelings that matters.\n\nWhat's more concerning is the fact that your partner denied having these feelings multiple times before being honest with you. This lack of transparency and trust can be damaging to a relationship. It's essential to have open and honest communication with your partner, especially when it comes to feelings and desires.\n\nIt's also important to consider the context of your partner's actions. He didn't act on his feelings, but he did consider breaking up with you to pursue something with your best friend. This suggests that his feelings may have been stronger than he initially let on.\n\nGiven this, I would recommend having a deeper conversation with your partner about what this means for your relationship. You need to know that you're on the same page and that you're both committed to working through any issues that arise.\n\nAs for your friendship with your best friend, it's essential to reevaluate the dynamics of your relationship with her. Her behavior, as you described it, is concerning, and you deserve to have a friend who respects your boundaries and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.\n\nRemember that you're not obligated to keep your friend in your life if she's making you feel this way. You deserve to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you, not those who make you feel anxious or uncomfortable.\n\nTake your time to process everything, and don't rush into any decisions.

I just want to talk to him and work it out and this will all just be one big misunderstanding, right? I’m heartbroken. I can’t have kids here, but if I leave I’ll be alone and also probably won’t have kids. And I’ll be broken and ashamed. All those conversations. He’s going to want me back or want an explanation.\n\nI really think that’s what I’m hung up on the most. He has so little emotional awareness that I KNOW he won’t have any idea what I’m talking about. I know he’ll think I’m crazy. I want him to know what he’s done but he just… he’s not going to. He might not ever understand. \n\nWe’re so happy so much of the time, I don’t know if I can do this.\n\nAnyways, hi, worst update. But you all were right. \n\nFor anyone in a similar situation, Lundy Bancroft’s “Why Does He Do That?” was very eye opening and described him in ways I couldn’t articulate on my own. He fits the profile of the Water Torturer perfectly.\n\nAdditionally, very very helpful these past few days: The Hotline (looks like I can’t link, but you can search.) They have a text or chat service, and for anyone out there like me, it’s not “just” emotional/verbal abuse, it’s abuse and they are there to help and support. I spent a few hours over a few days just talking through things with people who really understood and it was exactly what I needed. Please reach out if it’s something you need.\n\nTL;DR My husband isn’t mean, he’s verbally abusive. Don’t know what’s next.",
    "human": "I completely understand why you want him to accept and understand and admit what he’s doing, but he almost certainly won’t. You don’t need him to validate it to know what’s going on, because YOU know.   \n\nYou will be ok. But you need to leave.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling torn and uncertain about what to do. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the abuse and seek help.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and you're not crazy. It's not uncommon for people to feel stuck in abusive relationships, and it's not your fault. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.\n\nRegarding your concerns about leaving, I want to acknowledge that it's a huge decision, and it's normal to feel scared about the unknown. However, staying in an abusive relationship can have long-term consequences for your mental and emotional wellbeing. It's essential to prioritize your own safety and well-being.\n\nIt's great that you're considering seeking legal aid and a safe exit plan. I would encourage you to take small steps towards that. You can start by reaching out to the DV organization and having a conversation with them about your situation. They can provide you with guidance and support.\n\nRegarding your fears about being alone and not having kids, I want to remind you that you deserve to be in a relationship where you're valued and respected. You deserve to have a partner who loves and supports you. It's not about being alone or having kids; it's about being in a healthy, loving relationship.\n\nAs for your husband's lack of emotional awareness, it's not uncommon for abusers to lack empathy. However, that doesn't mean you should stay in the relationship to \"fix\" him. You deserve to be with someone who can meet you where you are and understand your needs.\n\nLastly, please remember that you're not responsible for your husband's behavior. You didn't cause the abuse, and you don't deserve to be treated this way. You're worthy of love, respect, and kindness, regardless of what your husband does or says.\n\nKeep taking small steps towards your safety and well-being. You got this, and you're not alone."

    "sentence": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for several years and live together. We are both an average weight, neither super healthy nor overweight. We both exercise a few times a week, with me exercising  slightly more but eating slightly unhealthier, but we try to be generally health-conscious in our diets. \n\n\nAbout 2 months ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose some weight and be healthier, both exercising more and eating healthier. I said I support this and would be willing to shift our shared meals towards being slightly healthy. However, I myself am not trying to lose weight, so when we are not together I might still help myself to a burger or bag of chips and whatnot. What I expected was for us to do things like eating less meat and cheese for dinner, more vegetables, that kind of thing. Instead, what happened is that my girlfriend is now basically scared of all foods and policing everything I eat. \n\n\nWhenever I suggest a meal for dinner that is reasonably healthy, she will say she doesn't want it or it's not healthy enough. I'll propose either a complete alternative or say something like \"what if we make this same meal but do chicken instead of beef or cut out the cheese entirely.\" She will then come up with all the reasons that everything I listed is bad, like the food being too much work or too boring or too many calories or too much fat. So I'll say that I've suggested all the things I can think of for now so she should suggest what she wants and I'll go along with it. She'll say she needs time to think about it because there is SO much to consider, but then just refuses to make a decision because every food has some reason or another why it might be unhealthy. So it will get to be like 9 o'clock and she still hasn't come up with a plan. At that point it's too late for any real meal so our only options will be something like a boxed/canned meal or take-out, which then results in her pouting the rest of the evening because it wasn't what she wanted. She has zero self-awareness and takes no responsibility that her inability to choose anything is what is leading us to have to eat food that isn't particularly healthy. This was happening almost every night.\n\n\nAfter a few times of this occurring, I started to set boundaries and say things like if she doesn't come up with a suggestion by 7, I am going to just decide what's for dinner and she has to accept that. She got better for a little bit and I didn't have to really enforce this at first, but once she fell back into being indecisive, I stuck with the rule and would just say that we are having X since she didn't decide and would start cooking. Well that went pretty horribly because everything I would decide to make was considered not good enough because either she didn't feel like it or it was not healthy enough (I rarely suggested anything that was especially unhealthy since I knew she wanted to eat healthy foods). I'm talking like a salad or chicken and rice was not good enough. She would then spend the rest of the night either pouting or go into her room and have a full-blown meltdown where she would be sobbing because the chicken we have is not organic or the lettuce for a salad was too dirty and she was scared of ingesting germs. After several times of this, we ended up getting in a series of fights where I told her that she has no right to be this upset about the choices I made when she is putting in little to no effort in saying what she wants. She eventually got better in this department but it's still not uncommon for us to eat late or for her to cry because she didn't like my dinner choice.\n\n\nAbout a week and a half ago, a new pattern emerged where she started policing everything I ate, not just being conscious of what she herself is eating. When I would want a snack and would get pretzels, she would get on me about how too much salt is bad for me. When I would eat an apple, she would get on me about how eating fruits too late in the evening is bad for you because it can make you dizzy in the morning (never heard of this but that's not the point). When I returned from the grocery store, she would go through everything I bought and carefully inspect everything to make sure everything was organic, healthy, everything had to be perfect. If I bought pasta from the grocery store, she would question me on why did I buy it from this store instead of this other store where they have gluten-free pasta. When I would say \"oh the other pasta doesn't taste nearly as good to me and I didn't feel like doing a second trip so I just got this normal kind here.\" Then she would yell at me about gluten being so unhealthy and how I'm jeopardizing my health. It's been getting to the point where I'm scared to eat anything around her and it's driving me nuts.\n\n\nI hit my breaking point yesterday when I had a really busy and rough day at work (I work from home and get done before she does). After I got done but before she got home from her job, I went over to a nearby bakery and bought a brownie, just because I had a rough day and wanted to treat myself. I got home, ate the brownie, and threw it away. Later that night when my girlfriend was home, she called me into the kitchen. I came over and she is holding this brownie wrapper with the bakery's label on it and is like \"what do you have to say for yourself\" as if I am some child caught doing something horrible. I then realize that not only should she not be policing everything I eat, the fact that she has this wrapper in her hands means that she literally pulled it out of the trash, and it was underneath several items including a bag of raw chicken juice. There was nothing I had done to suggest I went to the bakery, so she had no reason to be suspicious and check the trash just this once, which meant that she has probably been checking the trash regularly. We then got in a fight where I said that she has no right trying to control every single thing I eat like this and I am allowed to make my own choices on what I have outside of the meals we cook together. Plus it's disgusting that she went through the trash just to check that I am sticking to the rules that she has established in her head and I feel like my privacy was violated. She fired back about how she cares about her health and she can't be with someone who so clearly doesn't care for their own body and doesn't have the same health values that she does, and she will never forgive me if I develop health issues later down the line because of my poor dietary choices (as if I'm going to die because I ate pasta with gluten in it or have a brownie once every three months). She then stormed off and locked herself in her room the rest of the night, then left in the morning before I woke up.\n\n\nHow can I get her to understand my side of things and that she needs to stop controlling what I eat? Or is there something else at play that I should be worried about? This literally wasn't an issue at all two months ago so I have no idea what happened that could make her start caring like this so much.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: girlfriend decided she wants to eat healthier for herself but has decided she needs to control everything I eat too, including digging around in the trash to make sure I am not eating unhealthily behind her back.",
    "human": "This sounds like orthorexia. Its an eating disorder where you are fixated on eating healthily from my rudimentary knowledge. I lived with someone who was recovering from it. It sounds like your girlfriend needs to speak to a therapist well versed in this area.",
    "base_reply": "It sounds like a very frustrating and toxic situation. It's understandable that you feel like your girlfriend is trying to control your every move and dictate what you can and can't eat. Here are some suggestions that might help you address the issue:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation: Try to have a calm and rational conversation with your girlfriend about how her behavior is making you feel. Explain that you understand she's trying to make healthy choices for herself, but that doesn't mean she has the right to control what you eat. Be specific about how her actions are affecting you, such as feeling anxious or embarrassed around food choices.\n2. Set boundaries: It's essential to establish clear boundaries and communicate them to your girlfriend. Let her know that you're not willing to compromise your own food choices to accommodate her standards. You can say something like, \"I understand you're trying to make healthy choices, but I'm an adult and can make my own decisions about what I eat. I appreciate your concerns, but I need you to respect my boundaries.\"\n3. Focus on your own health: Instead of getting defensive or argumentative, try to shift the focus to your own health and well-being. You can say something like, \"I appreciate your concern for my health, but I'm actually doing okay. I exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet. I'd appreciate it if you could focus on your own health goals and let me make my own choices about what I eat.\"\n4. Seek mediation or counseling: If the situation continues to escalate and you're feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through the underlying issues driving your girlfriend's behavior.\n5. Re-evaluate the relationship: Unfortunately, if your girlfriend's behavior continues to be controlling and intrusive, it may be a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship. You may need to consider whether this is a healthy and sustainable partnership for you.\n\nAs for what might have triggered her behavior, it's possible that her newfound focus on health and wellness has become an all-consuming passion, and she's projecting those values onto you. It's also possible that she's struggling with her own body image or self-esteem issues, which are manifesting as a need to control what you eat. Whatever the reason, it's essential to address the issue and work together to find a more balanced and respectful dynamic in your relationship."

And if it's no, then maybe there's something I really do need to change. And if it's \"eh, you're kinda ok,\" that's usually indicative of me not doing enough things for me. \n\nA lot of people with esteem issues could actually do with being a bit more selfish, ironically! So: \n\n1. Decide if you like you. There will always be somebody better. There will always be somebody worse. But there will also always be yourself to answer to. :) that's the important one. \n\n2. If you don't like your answer to yourself, then go out and do some investing in yourself. Hit the gym. Learn a hobby. Just like anything else, it's always meaningless to us until we begin investing in it. Do the same with yourself!",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. Comparison is a sneaky and insidious habit that can be really hard to break, but it's a crucial step towards building self-esteem and living a more authentic life.\n\nHere's the thing: comparison is a natural human tendency, and it's not necessarily something you can simply \"stop\" doing overnight. But you can develop strategies to become more mindful of when you're doing it, and to redirect your focus towards more positive and constructive thinking.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that comparison is often rooted in a deep-seated fear of not being good enough. It's like your brain is constantly saying, \"What if I'm not as smart/intelligent/beautiful as they are?\" And that fear can be paralyzing.\n\nTo combat this, I want you to try something called \"self-compassion.\" When you catch yourself comparing yourself to others, take a deep breath and say to yourself, \"Ah, I'm doing it again. I'm comparing myself to someone else. That's okay. It's not a failure, it's just a habit.\" Then, redirect your attention to something positive about yourself. It could be something as simple as, \"I'm really proud of myself for showing up to this meeting today\" or \"I'm grateful for my unique strengths and talents.\"\n\nAnother strategy is to focus on your own journey, rather than someone else's. Instead of thinking, \"Why can't I be as smart as my classmate?\", ask yourself, \"What am I learning from this experience? What can I apply to my own life?\" or \"What are my goals and priorities, and how can I align them with my values?\"\n\nIt's also important to recognize that everyone has their own struggles and imperfections, even the people you're comparing yourself to. Your brother might be more mentally stable and functional, but he's probably also struggling with his own unique set of challenges. Your friends might be prettier, but they're probably also dealing with their own insecurities and flaws.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your comparisons as a compliment, rather than a criticism. Instead of thinking, \"My friend is so pretty, I'll never be that\", try reframing it as, \"Wow, my friend is really beautiful, and I'm grateful to have her in my life.\" Or, \"I admire my brother's mental stability, and I can learn from his resilience.\"\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to break a habit like comparison, but it's worth it. You are not your comparisons. You are a unique, talented, and worthy individual, and it's time to start celebrating that."

Keep putting yourself out there, and eventually, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take small steps outside your comfort zone to start building connections. You don't have to be best friends with someone overnight, but having a few acquaintances or casual friends can make a big difference in your social life.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize self-care during this time. Make sure you're taking care of your physical and mental health, and don't hesitate to reach out to your partner or a therapist if you're feeling overwhelmed."

Ask yourself if you're willing to compromise on your emotional well-being for the sake of physical intimacy. Remember, relationships should be a partnership, not a transaction.\n4. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your concerns. Having a support system can help you feel less isolated and more empowered to address the issue.\n5. Don't compromise: If your boyfriend is unwilling to work on his emotional labor and kindness, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve to be treated with respect, empathy, and kindness, regardless of your physical intimacy.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being."

For example, turn $1000 invested into $1100 to $1200 or more after a month or so. After a while maybe ramp it up a bit and diversify.\n\nWhile I'd honestly like to profit more, I'm trying to be realistic... \n\nI'm physically disabled (I have an incredibly painful bone marrow issue where it turns into tumors, my bones are really weak, etc) so I don't have a lot of stamina.

    "human": "It’s extremely difficult to make 10% per month and the only way to do that is with an immense amount of risk. 10% per year would be more realistic",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and limitations. Given your situation, I'd recommend exploring low-risk, passive income opportunities that don't require extensive physical activity. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. High-Yield Savings Account: Consider opening a high-yield savings account with a reputable online bank. This will earn you around 2% APY, which may not seem like much, but it's a low-risk, passive way to grow your initial $1000. You can explore options like Ally, Marcus, or Discover.\n2. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Platforms like Lending Club and Prosper allow you to lend money to individuals or small businesses, earning interest on your investment. Be cautious, as P2P lending carries some risk, but you can diversify your portfolio to minimize losses.\n3. Index Funds or ETFs: Invest in a low-cost index fund or ETF that tracks the overall market. This way, you'll benefit from the growth of the market as a whole, without having to actively manage individual stocks. Vanguard and Fidelity offer low-cost index funds and ETFs.\n4. Dividend-paying Stocks: Look for established companies with a history of paying consistent dividends. This way, you'll earn a relatively stable income stream. Consider companies like Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, or Procter & Gamble.\n5. Robo-Advisors: Automated investment platforms like Betterment, Wealthfront, or Schwab Intelligent Portfolios offer diversified investment portfolios with minimal effort required from you. They'll manage your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed.\n6. Online Surveys and Gigs: While not directly generating passive income, you can use your IT skills to complete online surveys, freelance writing, or other gigs that fit your schedule. Platforms like UserTesting, Survey Junkie, or Upwork can be a good starting point.\n\nTo ramp up your investments and diversify your portfolio, consider the following:\n\n* Start with a small, diversified portfolio and gradually add more funds as your initial investments grow.\n* Set a realistic growth target, such as 5-7% annual returns, and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\n* Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.\n* Monitor your investments regularly, but avoid frequent changes, as this can lead to unnecessary losses.\n\nKeep in mind that investing always carries some level of risk. It's essential to educate yourself on the potential risks and rewards associated with each investment option. Consider consulting with a financial advisor or conducting your own research to find the best fit for your situation.\n\nRemember to prioritize your physical health and take regular breaks to avoid exacerbating your condition. Investing should be a long-term strategy, and it's essential to focus on your overall well-being."

    "base_reply": "Meeting new people can be intimidating, especially when you don't have a mutual connection. As a friendly and honest advice assistant, I'll share some tips that have worked for me and others.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that meeting new people takes time and effort. You can't force it, but you can increase your chances by being intentional and putting yourself out there.\n\nHere are some strategies I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Join a community or group that aligns with your interests**: This could be a book club, a sports team, a hiking group, or a volunteer organization. When you're doing something you love, it's easier to strike up conversations with like-minded people.\n2. **Attend events and gatherings**: Look for events, meetups, or conferences related to your interests. This could be a concert, a festival, or a networking event. Be open to striking up conversations with people around you.\n3. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, language course, or art class. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also meet people with similar interests.\n4. **Use online platforms**: Websites and apps like Meetup.com, Bumble BFF, or Hey! Vina can help you connect with people in your area who share your interests.\n5. **Be genuine and friendly**: When meeting new people, be yourself, and don't be afraid to show your personality. Smile, make eye contact, and ask open-ended questions to keep the conversation flowing.\n6. **Follow up and stay in touch**: If you hit it off with someone, make sure to exchange numbers or social media handles and stay in touch. Suggest getting together for a coffee or activity to continue building your connection.\n\nAs for me, I'd probably join a book club or a hiking group. I enjoy reading and being outdoors, so it would be a great way to meet people who share my interests. I'd also attend events and gatherings related to my passions, like concerts or art exhibitions.\n\nRemember, meeting new people takes time, and it's okay to not click with everyone. Focus on building genuine connections, and don't be discouraged if it takes a little time to find the right people.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any specific interests or activities you'd like to explore?"

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're considering the ethical implications of your situation. I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some guidance.\n\nIt's understandable that you're frustrated with being turned away, but lying to a doctor about having children is not the right approach. Not only is it unethical, but it's also a potential risk to your health. A doctor's decision to perform a vasectomy is based on their professional judgment, and fabricating information can lead to complications or even harm.\n\nInstead, I would recommend exploring alternative options. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Research other urologists in your area: You might find a different doctor who is more willing to perform a vasectomy for a man without children.\n2. Consider a different procedure: There might be alternative methods for permanent birth control, such as a vasectomy reversal or a non-surgical method like a vas clip or occlusion.\n3. Explore other options for birth control: If you're not ready for a permanent solution, you could explore other forms of birth control, such as condoms, the pill, or a vasectomy reversal.\n\nRegarding follow-up questions, it's likely that the doctor will ask you about your motivations for getting a vasectomy, your relationship status, and your plans for family planning. Be honest and open about your situation, and explain your reasons for seeking the procedure. This might help the doctor understand your perspective and make a more informed decision.\n\nAs for the legality of lying to a doctor, it's generally considered a form of medical fraud. While it's not a criminal offense, it can lead to serious consequences, including damage to your relationship with the doctor and potentially even legal action.\n\nRemember, honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to your health. I would encourage you to prioritize your well-being and find a doctor who is willing to work with you, rather than risking your health and reputation by lying."

And that if I liked the one I have already started dating enough, I shouldn't want to go on a date with somebody new. And I hear you. I will explain my situation below and see what you all think.\n\nI have been on 3 dates with 32/F, but as of now, we have not kissed, we spoke about how we felt during our last date and she said she wants to keep seeing me, but she doesn't want to rush into anything. She said that because of her dating history she is very slow to catch feelings, and she said that as of now, she has no feelings for me. Now this might sound like doom and gloom, but the dates with her have been so much fun. I have never laughed so much with a woman before. We have the same sense of humor and we vibe. She also set up the 4th date and she said I can come over to her place in a few weeks for dinner.\n\nBetween the dates we have no interaction, I have tried chatting with her but she leaves me on read if I haven't asked a question. But she is perfectly fine to talk with so I don't think this is a major issue.\n\nWell, anyway, when she said she didn't have feelings for me and wants to take it slow, it felt wrong for me to be \"all in\" so I wrote to someone I have matched with on Tinder. And the woman on Tinder 28/F is extremly similar to me in the important ways. We chat easily and she replies several times per day. 32/F also has a cat that I am allergic to whilst 28/F does not if that matters.\n\nPart of me wants to see things through with 32/F before I meet somebody else, but I am also worried that I am being noble for no reason since me and 32/F are not exclusive.\n\nWhat do you think is right to do in this situation?\n\n**TLDR**: Been on 3 dates with 32/F but she said she wants to take it slow and that she doesn't have any feelings for me as of now. Then I wrote to somebody on Tinder where conversation over text flows easily. The dates with 32/F have been so much fun so I don't want to ruin that, if it's true that she will warm up to me with time.",

She's made it clear she doesn't have feelings for you yet, and you're right to wonder if it's worth investing more time and emotional energy into the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, you've had a blast on the dates, and it's understandable that you'd want to see where things go with her. The fact that she's still willing to see you and has invited you over to her place suggests she's not entirely uninterested.\n\nNow, let's consider the Tinder situation. It's natural to want to explore other options, especially when you're not feeling a strong emotional connection with someone. However, it's crucial to be honest with yourself about your intentions. Are you genuinely interested in getting to know 28/F better, or are you using her as a safety net or a distraction from the uncertainty with 32/F?\n\nHere's a suggestion: take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Ask yourself what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. Are you willing to wait it out with 32/F and see if she develops feelings for you, or do you need a more immediate emotional connection?\n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with 32/F about your feelings and concerns. Let her know that you're feeling uncertain about the relationship and that you're considering other options. This might give her a chance to open up and share her thoughts, which could help you make a more informed decision.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make a choice that aligns with your values and goals. Don't feel pressured to rush into anything or stay in a relationship that's not serving you. Take your time, be honest with yourself and others, and trust that the right decision will come to you."

We talk through all of our disagreements or what you may call them very civilly and always come to a compromise that works for us both.\n\nNow with that being said, she tends to always say how she feels no matter what. I don't think this is a bad thing at all, but when it comes to compliments and how she feels about me, it can be a bit much at times. Let me walk you through our typical day together:\n\nWhen we first see each other she calls me handsome, I call her pretty, gorgeous, beautiful, etc. Then she'll likely go on a tangent for about two minutes on how handsome she thinks I am and how much she loves me, this happens pretty often. Then, let's say I go to the bathroom. When I get back she'll tell me she missed me and fully expects me to feel the same way, but that's just not how I work and she knows this. When we're not together she'll say she misses me within the first few hours of us not being together, and again this is just not how I work. Usually, I can feel when things have started to wear on me but this was more so like a plateau where the special feeling that used to come with these sayings just went away.\n\nAs stated above, I do not want her to stop saying any of these things, I just want her to stop saying them so much because it honestly just doesn't feel as special anymore even though I know she means it. When she says it, I just feel like I have to say it back to keep her happy.

That's a fantastic starting point for addressing this issue.\n\nBefore you have the conversation, consider what you want to achieve. Do you want her to stop saying the compliments altogether, or just tone it down a bit? Be clear about your feelings and boundaries, but also be open to finding a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of telling her to stop saying the compliments, try framing the conversation around how you're feeling. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I love that you always tell me how you feel about me. It means a lot to me that you appreciate me. However, to be honest, it's started to feel a bit overwhelming to me. I feel like I'm just going through the motions when you say these things, and it doesn't feel as special or meaningful to me as it used to. I want to make sure we can find a balance that works for both of us. Can we find ways to express our appreciation for each other in other ways, or at least tone down the frequency of the compliments?\"\n\nBy focusing on how you're feeling and what you need, you're more likely to get a positive and understanding response from your GF. Remember to listen to her perspective as well and try to find a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nLastly, don't worry too much about being \"right\" or \"wrong\" in this conversation. It's okay to have different feelings and needs in a relationship, and it's great that you're taking the time to communicate openly with your GF."

However, it's great that you're recognizing the importance of balance and wanting to work on being more relaxed in social settings.\n\nHere are some tips to help you chill out at parties and one-on-one situations:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Before attending a party, take some time to relax and unwind. Listen to calming music, take a warm bath, or practice some gentle stretches. This can help reduce your stress levels and make you feel more centered.\n2. **Arrive late and leave early**: If possible, arrive a bit late to the party, and plan to leave a bit early. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by the initial chaos and give you a chance to recharge before the party winds down.\n3. **Find a quiet spot**: When you're feeling overwhelmed, excuse yourself and find a quiet spot to collect your thoughts. This could be the bathroom, a balcony, or even just a corner of the room. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that it's okay to take a break.\n4. **Focus on active listening**: When engaging with others, make an effort to truly listen to what they're saying. Ask open-ended questions, and show genuine interest in their thoughts and experiences. This can help you stay present and engaged without feeling like you need to dominate the conversation.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness is all about being present in the moment. When you're feeling anxious or intense, take a moment to focus on your breath, your surroundings, or the sensations in your body. This can help calm your nerves and bring you back to the present.\n6. **Find common ground**: You mentioned that you tend to feel intense unless you have a lot in common with someone. Try to find shared interests or experiences with others, and use those as conversation starters. This can help you build connections and feel more at ease.\n7. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to not be \"on\" all the time. It's okay to take a step back, collect your thoughts, or excuse yourself for a bit. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't immediately click with someone or feel like you're not being your usual, more relaxed self.\n\nRemember, being \"chill\" is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself. Start with small steps, and don't be afraid to take breaks or step away when you need to. With time and practice, you'll become more comfortable in social situations and develop a sense of ease that's all your own."

Becoming rich by making your money work for you requires discipline, patience, and a solid understanding of personal finance. Here are some pro tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Live below your means**: The first step is to create a budget that accounts for every single dollar you earn. Prioritize needs over wants, and make sure you're not overspending. Aim for a 50/30/20 split: 50% for necessities, 30% for discretionary spending, and 20% for saving and debt repayment.\n2. **Pay off high-interest debt**: Focus on eliminating high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, as soon as possible. Consider consolidating debt into a lower-interest loan or balance transfer credit card. Make a plan to pay off the principal amount, and avoid further borrowing.\n3. **Build an emergency fund**: Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a readily accessible savings account. This fund will help you avoid going into debt when unexpected expenses arise.\n4. **Invest wisely**: Start with low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the overall market. Aim to contribute at least 10% of your income towards retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA. Take advantage of compound interest by starting early and being consistent.\n5. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs, 529 plans, or Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for specific goals while reducing your tax liability.\n6. **Develop multiple income streams**: Diversify your income sources to reduce financial risk. This could include starting a side hustle, investing in real estate, or generating passive income through dividend-paying stocks or peer-to-peer lending.\n7. **Educate yourself**: Continuously learn about personal finance, investing, and wealth-building strategies. Websites like The Balance, NerdWallet, and books like \"The Total Money Makeover\" by Dave Ramsey can be great resources.\n8. **Avoid lifestyle inflation**: As your income increases, avoid the temptation to inflate your lifestyle by spending more on luxuries. Instead, direct excess funds towards saving, investing, and debt repayment.\n9. **Stay disciplined and patient**: Building wealth takes time and discipline. Avoid getting caught up in get-rich-quick schemes and stay focused on your long-term goals.\n10. **Seek professional guidance**: If you're unsure about any aspect of personal finance or investing, consider consulting a financial advisor or planner who can provide personalized guidance.\n\nRemember, becoming rich by making your money work for you requires a long-term commitment to financial discipline and education.

    "human": "Why do you need his permission to work?",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you're taking a huge step by acknowledging the challenges in your relationship and seeking help. I'm here to support you.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you're not being overdramatic; you're being honest and aware of the difficulties in your relationship. It takes courage to admit when things aren't working, especially when you're feeling stuck.\n\nGiven your situation, I think it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your child. You mentioned that you're on the spectrum and struggle with communication; it's crucial to find a way to express yourself effectively.\n\nSince your partner doesn't want to engage in therapy, it might be helpful to focus on self-care and personal growth. Use this time to work on building your own skills, education, and independence. This will not only help you feel more empowered but also provide a safety net for your child.\n\nConsidering your current situation, I would recommend taking a step back and focusing on yourself for a while. This might mean taking a break from the relationship or re-evaluating your priorities. You mentioned you're not having much luck with job interviews, but having some job prospects lined up is a great start. Keep working on those, and once you're more financially stable, you can reassess your relationship.\n\nIt's also essential to remember that you don't have to do this alone. Reach out to local support groups or online communities for people on the autism spectrum; they might offer valuable advice and resources. Additionally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work on your communication skills and provide emotional support.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel heard, respected, and supported. If that's not happening, it might be time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is sustainable for you.\n\nRemember, you're doing the best you can under difficult circumstances. Keep pushing forward, and know that things will get better with time and effort."

    "sentence": "We are a group of gay men who have known one another for several years. One of the men came out a few years ago. I’ll call him John. John recently came out again, now as transgender. John’s desire that we call him by a new name (correcting us when we refer to him as John), his need to talk with us incessantly about his transition, his change of clothing, the slow physical effects of the hormones he is taking — all of this has become a challenge for the rest of the group when we hang around together.\nBut our real concern is that we recently planned a gay tour in Mexico. The tour is very structured, with little personal time. Our group makes up a majority of the tour.\nJohn seems to think that we should all accept his new identity without reservation, with as much cheer and acceptance as he does for himself, not thinking or caring about how any of us might feel.\nAs superficial as this sounds, we no longer want our friend John to join us. There are reasons that gay men enjoy traveling together, and it’s not to hang around with a woman.\nStraight people imagine that gay men view trans men/women in the same inclusive bubble as other gay men. We are all, so the acronym implies, part of that big, progressive L.G.B.T.Q.+ umbrella. Not true. In general, gay men (for all of our performances of femininity) do not understand trans identity — we don’t commonly socialize together.\nThe bottom line is that John’s presence will spoil a much-anticipated and expensive vacation. Do we just put up or shut up? Should we talk? If so, about what?",
    "human": "You insist on referring to your friend by a male name, representing the one she used before she transitioned. That indicates a basic lack of empathy; “deadnaming” people like this — using the name they used before transitioning — undermines the process of inhabiting the gender identities they have affirmed, and is, in any case, disrespectful. If the other cis men in your group really think of her in this way and resist acknowledging her transition, then joining you on vacation is probably not a good idea for her.\nShe has obviously done a lot to explain her transition to you. (That’s one of the burdens uninformed cis people impose on trans people.) You should let her know that you’re still struggling with it. Once she recognizes that, she may well decide herself that she doesn’t want to go on a vacation with you.\nA word about your vacation plans: People get together on the basis of social identities all the time. There are plenty of travel clubs with names like Black Girls Travel Too, Latinas Who Travel and Shefari. Small social groups, morally and legally, don’t have to abide by the rules that govern public accommodations; in “The Little Rascals,” the He-Man Womun Haters Club (which Spanky restarts in a reaction to a boys-excluding party given by the McGillicuddy girls) would properly not attract the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And a female traveling companion would, I grant, be at odds with your objective of having an all-gay-men holiday. (I’ve also read that many gay clubs in Mexico have been distressingly hostile to trans women.)\nStill, your letter suggests that your problem is not so much the presence of a woman as the presence of a trans woman. If so, you have a way to go in treating your friend with the respect she deserves.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and the complexities of the situation. It's natural to feel uncomfortable and unsure about how to navigate this sensitive topic. Before I offer advice, I want to acknowledge that it's essential to approach this conversation with empathy and respect for John's identity.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that John's transition is a significant aspect of his life, and it's natural for him to want to share his experiences and feelings with his friends. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge that your group's concerns and boundaries are valid.\n\nBefore having a conversation with John, consider the following:\n\n1. Acknowledge John's identity: Start the conversation by acknowledging John's gender identity and expressing your support for him as a person. Let him know that you care about him and value your friendship.\n2. Express your concerns: Share your concerns about the impact his presence might have on your vacation. Be honest about your feelings, but avoid blaming or shaming John for his transition. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and avoid making assumptions about his feelings.\n3. Focus on the group's needs: Explain how John's constant discussions about his transition might affect the group's dynamic and the tone of the vacation. You can say something like, \"Hey John, we're all excited to spend time together, but we're worried that the constant focus on your transition might make it difficult for us to relax and enjoy the trip. We want to make sure we can all have a good time together.\"\n4. Explore alternatives: If you're not comfortable discussing this with John directly, consider talking to the tour organizers or exploring alternative accommodations or activities that would allow for more personal space and relaxation.\n5. Be prepared for different reactions: John might be upset or defensive, and it's essential to be prepared for a range of reactions. Listen actively and try to understand his perspective, but also maintain your boundaries and assert your needs.\n\nRemember that this conversation is not about rejecting John or his identity, but about finding a solution that works for everyone involved. It's essential to prioritize respect, empathy, and open communication to navigate this complex situation.\n\nIn terms of whether to put up or shut up, I would recommend having an open and honest conversation with John. It's better to address the issue directly and respectfully than to let it simmer beneath the surface and potentially damage your friendship or the vacation.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to discuss any specific aspects of this situation further?"

And honestly while I love dogs, sometimes they gross me out. Like trying to eat another dogs poop, licking their private parts, rolling in mud or poop, slobber... Like I will cuddle or pet a dog but I won't let them lick my face and I'll wash my hands afterwards. \n\nVic is definitely more used to the kinda grossness that comes with dogs than I am. \n\nHe lets his dog sleep in bed and cuddle on the sofa with him. He has a house and the dog has free run of the house and can go in any of the rooms except the attic which has been converted into a guestroom. And that's just because the steps up there are ladderlike, and the dog can't climb them. \n\nSo, when I went over Vic's house at first, when we were dating, I'd go home at night. We were just taking stuff slow physically and not sleeping together early on. But now that we're together, the dog in the bed is kinda becoming a disagreement. \n\nWhen I come over his place, I don't want to sleep in the same bed or room as his dog. When he's home alone, he lets his dog sleep in his bed. He doesn't notice the smell but I can definitely smell the difference between clean sheets and bedding his dog has been sleeping in, it just smells like sweaty wet dog. \n\nI said that when I stay over, I'd rather either sleep in the attic guestroom, or sleep in his bedroom but only if he keeps his dog out of the room and washes changes the sheets and comforter if his dog has been on the bed since the last wash. \n\nI just find the bed icky if the dog's been in it, and I can't sleep with the dog's heavy breathing and snoring and moving around a lot in the same room. \n\nHe never wanted to sleep together in the attic, since he finds the bed uncomfortable.\n\nAs for his bedroom, he did that a few times, washing the sheets and comforter. But he started to get annoyed, saying that it was too much work and that washing the down comforter weekly was damaging it.\n\nI suggested maybe we sleep in the attic when I'm over, or he gets his dog a bed in the other room and trains him to stay off his bed, if he doesn't want to clean the bedding so often. \n\nHe said that I was being unreasonable, his dog had been in his life for four years and I was being unreasonable to come in and ask him to kick his dog out of the bed and room. I said he didn't have to, but I just was gonna start going home at night. \n\nSo we did that for a while but he also got irritated I also never wanted to have sex at his place unless he washed the bedding first. \n\nI feel like I'm being pretty reasonable and giving him a bunch of options but he feels like I'm being unreasonable and asking him to pick between me and his dog.\n\nTLDR - My boyfriend wants to share a bed with his dog. I sometimes want to sleep with my boyfriend but I don't want to sleep in bed with his dog or in sheets that smell strongly of dog. How do we compromise?",

You aren’t unreasonable for wanting to sleep in a dog-free bed, but I don’t see your bf changing this set up any time soon. You guys don’t seem compatible if you aren’t able to reach a compromise where both of you feel heard.",

It's essential to communicate your needs and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you find a compromise:\n\n1. **Discuss the dog's habits and needs**: Have a conversation with Vic about the dog's habits, like the slobbering, licking, and rolling in mud or poop. Maybe he's not aware of how much it bothers you, and talking about it can help him understand your perspective.\n2. **Find alternative sleeping arrangements**: As you mentioned, sleeping in the attic guestroom or having the dog sleep in another room could be a good solution. You could also consider getting a dog bed for Vic's bedroom, as you suggested, and training the dog to sleep in it.\n3. **Compromise on cleaning the bedding**: Perhaps you could agree on a compromise where Vic washes the bedding every two weeks instead of weekly. This way, you wouldn't have to worry about the strong dog smell, and Vic wouldn't have to wash the bedding as frequently.\n4. **Communicate your boundaries around intimacy**: It's understandable that you don't want to have sex with Vic at his place unless the bedding is clean. You can explain to him that this is a personal boundary for you and that you feel more comfortable having sex at home where you can control the environment.\n5. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take some time to reflect on what's most important to you in this relationship. Is it the compromise with the dog or the compromise with Vic? Are there other aspects of the relationship that you're willing to work on together?\n\nRemember, relationships are about finding a balance between individual needs and compromises. It's okay to have different opinions and habits, but it's essential to communicate openly and find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you and Vic find a way to compromise and move forward in your relationship."

I found it kind of annoying at first, but the last couple years she's been happier than I ever remember my mom being. They go out to dinner once a week, they talk and text a lot, etc. \n\nEarlier this week I had to fix a software problem on my mom's computer and I opened her browser history and saw a page about having safe sex for two women.

I just want you to know that I'm here for you and I support you, no matter what.\"\n4. Avoid assumptions: Try not to assume that your mom is \"munching Kim's rug\" or that their relationship is anything other than what it is. Instead, focus on your own feelings and thoughts, and let your mom share her perspective if she wants to.\n5. Be prepared for any reaction: Your mom might be relieved that you're open and accepting, or she might be upset or embarrassed. Be patient, listen to her concerns, and remember that her feelings are valid.\n\nRemember, the goal of this conversation is to be supportive and understanding, not to pry or judge. By being genuine, empathetic, and non-judgmental, you can help your mom feel more comfortable opening up about her relationship and build a stronger bond between the two of you."

Instead, aim for something that's light-hearted, playful, and acknowledges their joke while also showing you're not easily rattled. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Take a beat**: Before responding, take a brief pause (even just a second or two) to process their comment. This will help you gather your thoughts and avoid reacting impulsively.\n2. **Acknowledge their joke**: Start by acknowledging their comment with a nod or a smile. This shows you're aware of the joke and willing to engage.\n3. **Add a twist**: Add a playful twist to their joke or comment. This can be a clever remark, a witty observation, or even a self-deprecating comment. The goal is to show you're in on the joke and can handle a little teasing.\n4. **Keep it lighthearted**: Remember, the goal is to maintain a playful tone. Avoid getting too serious or defensive, as this can escalate the situation.\n\nSome examples to get you started:\n\n* \"Oh, I'm not hiding, I'm just conserving energy for more important things... like scrolling through my phone\" (acknowledges their comment, adds a twist, and keeps it lighthearted)\n* \"I'm not shy, I'm just selectively social.

Don't feel pressured to come up with a witty comeback if you're not feeling it. Sometimes, a simple \"Thanks for the joke!\" or \"I got it, you're trying to get me out of my shell\" can suffice.

Practice forgiveness and release the weight of self-blame.\n9. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the past or future. Mindfulness can help you develop a greater sense of self-awareness and acceptance.\n10. **Be patient**: Self-love is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Don't expect to wake up one day and suddenly love yourself. It's a process that requires effort, patience, and self-compassion.\n\nRemember, loving yourself is not selfish; it's essential for your well-being and happiness. By focusing on self-love, you'll become a more confident, resilient, and compassionate person, which can ultimately benefit your relationships and overall life."

Last year I sat on the couch to scared to talk to anyone and my boyfriend just now decides to tell me his family thought I was being a bit rude. I never imagined my shyness coming off as rudeness.

First, let me say that it's completely normal to feel nervous in these situations, and it's not about being rude, but rather about being introverted or shy.\n\nTo help you feel more comfortable and open up, here are some tips that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Think about the topics you're interested in talking about or the questions you have for his family. This can help you feel more prepared and confident when conversations arise.\n2. **Start small**: Don't feel like you need to tackle a big group or a long conversation right off the bat. Start with small, one-on-one conversations with someone you feel comfortable with, like your fiancé or a family member who seems friendly.\n3. **Listen more than you talk**: Sometimes, people who are shy or introverted tend to focus on their own thoughts and feelings, which can make it harder to connect with others. Try to focus on listening to others and asking follow-up questions. This can help you build connections and feel more comfortable.\n4. **Find common ground**: Look for things you have in common with his family members, like shared interests, hobbies, or experiences. This can be a great way to build connections and feel more at ease.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes.

Just be yourself, and people will likely respond positively to your authenticity.\n6. **Take breaks if needed**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it's okay to take a step back and recharge. Take a walk, read a book, or do something that helps you relax and feel more centered.\n\nAs for the anxiety, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of worrying about the whole 5-day trip, focus on what you can do in the next hour or the next conversation. Break it down into smaller, manageable chunks.\n\nLastly, have an open and honest conversation with your fiancé about your feelings and concerns. He may be able to offer some valuable insights or suggestions to help you feel more comfortable.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's okay to not be perfect.

    "base_reply": "The age-old conundrum! When someone doesn't pay you back after loaning them money, it can be frustrating and stressful. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you navigate the situation:\n\n1. **Stay calm**: Take a few deep breaths, count to ten, and try not to jump to conclusions. It's essential to approach the situation calmly and rationally.\n2. **Communicate**: Reach out to the person and have a polite, non-accusatory conversation. Ask them if everything is okay and if they're facing any difficulties in paying back the loan. This can help clear up any misunderstandings and potentially avoid further conflict.\n3. **Re-evaluate the loan agreement**: Review the original agreement or any written understanding you had with the person. If it was an informal agreement, consider writing a formal letter outlining the terms and expectations. This can help clarify any misunderstandings and provide a paper trail.\n4. **Set boundaries**: If the person is unable to pay back the loan, it's essential to set clear boundaries. Let them know what you're willing to do to help, such as offering a payment plan or temporary delay, but also be firm about your expectations.\n5. **Consider a payment plan**: If the person is struggling to pay back the loan, consider offering a payment plan. This can help them get back on track and ensure you receive your money back.\n6. **Don't be afraid to say no**: If the person is unable to pay back the loan and doesn't seem committed to making payments, it's okay to say no to further assistance. Your financial well-being is important, and you can't keep pouring money into a situation that's not working.\n7. **Document everything**: Keep a record of all communication, including dates, times, and details of conversations. This can be helpful if you need to involve a third party or take further action.\n8. **Consider involving a third party**: If the person is unwilling to communicate or make payments, you may need to involve a third party, such as a mediator or a debt collector. However, be cautious and make sure you're not taking on unnecessary risks or damaging your relationship with the person.\n9. **Learn and move on**: Take this as an opportunity to reflect on your own financial decisions and boundaries. Consider setting up better safeguards for future loans or developing a more robust financial plan.\n\nRemember, lending money to someone is a personal choice, and it's essential to prioritize your own financial well-being. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs."

Her mother's behavior is likely causing her a lot of emotional pain, and she needs someone to comfort and support her.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge your own desires and priorities. You've had a significant investment in your university experience, and this party is a special occasion. It's not just about the party itself, but also about the people and memories you've shared with your friends over the years.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of making a hasty decision, try to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you understand she's going through a tough time, but also express your own desires and concerns about missing the party. Be empathetic and non-judgmental, and try to find a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nPerhaps you could suggest doing something else with her that's more low-key, like going for a walk, having a quiet dinner, or watching a movie together. This way, you can still be there for her and support her without sacrificing your own needs and desires.\n\nRemember, relationships are about finding balance and compromise. It's okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes, as long as you're doing it in a way that respects and considers the other person's feelings.

Are you more likely to go along with others around certain colleagues, friends, or family members? Once you're aware of your patterns, you can prepare yourself for those situations.\n2. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace the idea that your opinions and thoughts are valuable. Believe that you have something unique to contribute, and that your input is worth considering. This mindset shift will help you feel more comfortable expressing yourself.\n3. **Start small**: Begin with low-stakes situations, like sharing your thoughts with a friend or family member about a non-controversial topic. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually move on to more significant conversations.\n4. **Prepare your responses**: Before entering a situation where you might feel inclined to agree or back down, take a moment to gather your thoughts and prepare a concise, assertive response. This will help you feel more confident in your opinions.\n5. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"You're right,\" say \"I think X, Y, or Z.\" This helps to own your thoughts and avoid coming across as confrontational. For example, \"I feel strongly about this topic, and I think we should consider X.\"\n6. **Practice assertive body language**: Make eye contact, stand up straight, and use open, confident gestures. This will help you feel more assertive and others will be more likely to take you seriously.\n7. **Reframe \"no\" as an opportunity**: When someone says \"no,\" don't take it as a personal rejection. Instead, view it as an opportunity to explore alternative solutions or find a compromise.\n8. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who encourage and respect your opinions. This will help you build confidence and feel more comfortable expressing yourself.\n9. **Celebrate your successes**: Acknowledge and celebrate each time you do assert yourself, even if it feels small. This will help you build momentum and reinforce positive habits.\n10. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Remember that building assertiveness takes time and practice. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – simply acknowledge the moment and try again.\n\nRegarding your concern about feeling remorse when trying to sound more forceful, it's normal to feel uncertain about how others will react. However, remember that assertiveness doesn't mean being aggressive or confrontational.

The fact that she didn't tell you about the kiss and continued to flirt with Andy despite being in a committed relationship with you is a significant red flag.\n\nRegarding the sex life, it's possible that the decrease in intimacy is a symptom of deeper issues in the relationship. It's not uncommon for couples to experience a dip in intimacy due to various reasons, such as stress, lack of communication, or emotional disconnection.\n\nNow, about your feelings of inadequacy: it's natural to wonder if you're not good enough, but it's essential to recognize that this is a common phenomenon in situations like this. Your girlfriend's behavior is not a reflection of your worth as a person or partner. It's crucial to separate her actions from your self-worth.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of dwelling on what you're doing wrong, focus on what you can control – your own emotions and reactions. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself during this challenging time.\n\nConsider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Use \"I\" statements to express how her actions have affected you, rather than accusing her of being unfaithful or not loving you enough.

If you feel that your girlfriend is not making an effort to prioritize your relationship or your feelings, it may be necessary to reevaluate whether this relationship is healthy and sustainable for you.\n\nRemember that healing takes time, and it's okay to take things slowly. You don't have to rush into making decisions or trying to fix everything immediately. Focus on nurturing yourself, and when you're ready, you can re-engage with your girlfriend and work together to build a stronger, more honest connection.\n\nLastly, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or a trusted advisor to guide you both through this challenging time. They can provide valuable insights and strategies to help you navigate this situation and work towards a healthier, more fulfilling relationship.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, valued, and loved.

Your husband is sharing a timelapse video on his social media account, and you're asking him to share it with you because you liked it and wanted to keep it. He's refusing, citing that it's his content and he doesn't want you to post it. You're feeling frustrated and upset because you feel like he's not being reasonable and is treating you like you're not entitled to have a copy of the video.\n\nIt's important to recognize that this issue is not just about the video itself, but about the underlying dynamics and power imbalance in your relationship. Your husband's refusal to share the video is a symbol of a larger issue, which is his control over the content and his perceived ownership of it. This is a red flag, and it's important to address it.\n\nHere are a few suggestions on how to handle this situation:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your husband: Try to have a calm and rational conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns. Explain to him that you understand that he's trying to protect his content, but that his refusal to share the video is making you feel left out and unimportant. Make it clear that you're not asking for ownership of the video, but rather for permission to keep a copy of it.\n2. Set boundaries: If your husband is not willing to share the video, set a boundary around what you're comfortable with. Let him know that you're willing to respect his wishes, but that you need some compromise. You can suggest that he share a screenshot or a still image from the video, or that he give you permission to take a screenshot yourself.\n3. Seek therapy: As you mentioned, you're planning to have a therapy session with your husband. This is a great step! Therapy can help you both work through the underlying issues and develop healthier communication habits. Make sure to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself during this process.\n4. Reflect on your own feelings and needs: Take some time to reflect on why this issue is so important to you. Is it because you feel like you're being excluded or left out? Is it because you're worried about losing your connection with your husband? Understanding your own feelings and needs can help you communicate more effectively with your husband and find a resolution that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and communication. It's okay to disagree, but it's important to find ways to work through conflicts and come out stronger on the other side."

If I don't know ahead of time then I get the freeze out or he gets upset and blames me for the issue. If I bring up that I wish he would respond in a different way or actually say what he needs from me he tells me \"You just drag stuff out too much\" or \"I just want this to be over.\"\n\nThere are so many examples of this and the most recent is me reaching out to a friend.

I'm not here to judge her, but once I started to feel anger I knew I needed to bring it up before I did something out of spite. I do reach out and she flies off the goddam handle. Starts attacking me personally, screaming, the whole nine. I stayed calm and reiterated what I originally said and let her know that I want feedback and will definitely take control of what I can fix on my end but it just ended in more yelling and personal attacks. I was absolutely crushed-she was one of my best friends-at least on my end. My fiancé talks to her husband (after she got her husband involved in it all) and he came home yelling at me saying \"why do you always have to start stuff?\" \"All of the things they are saying about you are true.\" \"The reason you have so many problems in your relationships is because you bring up everything to people.\"\n\nAfter an hour or so I explained that being communicative and kind while still approaching hard topics is part of having friendships and relationships-BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO ATTACK ME PERSONALLY.

I ask what he would like to take for lunch and he gets quiet when I say there aren't any leftovers. \"Should I make you burgers for lunch?\" He responds \"I just want leftovers.\" At this point, I have already explained that there are none and I am losing my patience.

His inability to communicate effectively, his anger, and his control issues are his own issues, not yours.\n\nI want to emphasize that you don't have to stay in this situation. You deserve better. You deserve someone who respects you, listens to you, and communicates effectively. You deserve to feel heard, seen, and understood.\n\nRegarding your therapy sessions, it's essential to continue attending and working on yourself. You're doing the right thing by acknowledging the issues and seeking help. However, it's also crucial to recognize that therapy is not a magic solution. It's a process, and it may take time to see significant changes.\n\nIn the meantime, I want to encourage you to prioritize self-care. Take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and surround yourself with people who support and uplift you. You are not alone in this.\n\nLastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to fantasize about a new life, a new job, or a new identity. It's a natural coping mechanism. But for now, focus on taking small steps towards self-care and self-preservation. You are worthy of love, respect, and happiness.\n\nRemember, you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep reaching out for support, and know that you are doing the best you can in a difficult situation."

    "sentence": "TLDR: long-time group of friends went on big camping trip. Friend who has struggled with alcoholism was a total asshole, made most people either pissed, uncomfortable, cried, or some combo of the 3. As there is a lot of drinking &amp; other drugs on these trips, is there any reasonable way forward with him?\n\nI am a part of a group of friends who loves camping. There are about 30 of us total. We do anything from weekend trips to major \"hike for a day away from civilization and stay there for a week\" trips.\n\nWe plan one big week-long trip a year and then smaller groups plan smaller trips throughout the year. Since the pandemic (and everybody getting some out of shape) our big trips have been less strenuous. We're all starting to feel our age more (most of us are in our 40s to 60s), so we've decided as a group to dial it back for the big trips.\n\nThe big trips involve packing enough stuff for about a week, and now hiking a few hours out to a more remote location where we don't be disturbed. A fair number of our people love drugs, and part of the experience for them is doing mushrooms in the woods and communing. Others (like myself) stick to a bit of alcohol to enjoy at the end of the day. Some of us bring woods-friendly crafts to sit around a fire and do together. A couple of people looooove to cook, and always bring something to make that is stunningly good over a fire.\n\nThis year, one of our people spent literally the entire time drunk, probably often black-out drunk. We have been aware that he struggled with drinking. The people who are closer to him have talked to him about it, both due to past concerning/bad behavior and also out of general love and concern. He actually told a few people that he quit drinking earlier this year because he knew he had a problem.\n\nAnd it is true that we did not see him obviously drinking. He never had a beer or accepted a spiked hot cocoa, and yet, he seemed constantly fucked up. So one of his closest friends went through his stuff when he was passed out (yes, I know, this was not OK behavior) and found a bunch of bottles of everclear hidden away in his stuff.\n\nI think there was a less than 2 day period during this week+ trip that he wasn't drunk and shitty in one way or another. If he wasn't falling down drunk, he was \"joking\" with people by being mean. He caused 2 people to cry with his \"jokes\" (nobody knew about the 1st time, but after the 2nd time a few people, myself included, told him to knock it the fuck off or leave). When he wasn't joking, he was having weird, inappropriate conversations with people, like brining up his sex life or their sex lives in random, uncomfortable ways. When that wasn't happening, he was unresponsive. Not in a like, incoherently drunk way, he would sit glaring into the fire and if someone tried to talk to him, ask how he was doing/what's up, he would loudly say \"OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY RIGHT NOW\" and continue to sit and glare and then eventually stomp off to his tent.\n\nHe had to leave early, and everybody was so glad he did, as the remaining weekend of the trip was a million times better without him.\n\nAfter we got back to civilization, I wrote him an email about how shitty and unacceptable his behavior was. A few other people did too. We basically told him that as of now, we (anybody who wrote the email) have zero interest in camping with him again until he gets his shit together. Someone else ended up putting together a WhatsApp convo that was basically everybody on the trip except for him, and NOBODY wants to have any trips with him again until he gets his alcoholism under control and improves his behavior.\n\nI'm probably going to be the person to talk to him about this, as I do handle a fair number of the interpersonal conflicts on the rare occasions that they crop up.\n\nBut here's the thing: let's say he says he gets sober - there really is no way to know for sure, right? Is it reasonable we demand he get into a program before we let him rejoin us? What about other drugs? Some of our people smoke pot and do mushrooms, and he does both of those things, though his behavior on them hasn't been problematic; it seems the alcohol is the problem.\n\nEven if he did get into a program, is going on a camping trip as a sober person with a bunch of other people who plan to do drugs and/or drink a smart idea? Is there any reasonable way forward with this? To be clear, everybody else seems to have a healthy relationship with drinking/drugs. The rest of our people range from those who don't drink/do any drugs, to those who drunk/smoke pot/do mushreooms/etc at a moderate rate. Nobody likes to or tries to get deliberately fucked up and the rest of the group uses these things as mood enhancers or as a way to relax a bit more vs like going on a heavy duty mushroom trip where you don't even know what reality is anymore, for instance.\n\nI would love especially to hear from people who are in recovery if there is any advice on how to handle this. If we cut him off from these trips entirely, I believe it would be fairly devastating to him. But we cannot have a repeat of the shit he pulled on this last trip. By day 2, everybody was walking on eggshells because of his erratic and shitty behavior.\n\nWe want to do the \"right\" thing here, but we don't know what that is. I know there probably is no one right way, but any advice on a good direction would be great!",
    "human": "You are jumping way, *wayyyyyy* ahead of the situation. \n\nHe hasn't taken responsibility for the situation. He hasn't apologised to anyone. He hasn't admitted he has a problem, he hasn't committed to improving himself, he hasn't sought out any resources or support, and he hasn't said \"Hey, can I come along next time if I promise to be good?\". \n\nThe conversation you need to have is, \"dude, your behaviour ruined the trip for the while that you were there and has really damaged your friendship with everyone who was there, myself included. We're also really worried about you. I'm/we're willing to support you with (helping you get into rehab/acting as accountability buddies/hosting more sober events/anything you legitimately feel up to doing), but unless we see significant changes in your behaviour, our friendship is not going to be at the place it once was.\"\n\nThe questions you are asking (\"what commitments should we want to see in him before we can trust him\") are the questions he should be asking *you*. He needs to be asking, \"what measurable steps can I take to earn all your trust back?\" And for some people, that answer might legitimately be, \"it's too late, the damage is permanent.\"\n\nBut the first step is HE needs to be committed to making the change. The onus is on him. You can't develop a forgiveness-recovery program for him if it's not even something he's even interested in pursuing.",
    "base_reply": "I understand the complexity of the situation. It's great that you're considering the well-being of your friend and the dynamics of the group. Here are some thoughts to consider:\n\n1. **Alcoholism is a serious issue**: While it's understandable to be concerned about the impact of his behavior, it's crucial to recognize that alcoholism is a serious health issue that requires professional attention. Demanding he gets sober or attend a program is not unreasonable, as it's essential for his well-being and the well-being of those around him.\n2. **Verification is difficult**: You're right that it's challenging to verify someone's sobriety, especially if they're not open about their struggles. However, you can encourage him to seek professional help and provide resources for support. This way, you're acknowledging his efforts to address his addiction while also setting boundaries for the group.\n3. **Group dynamics**: It's essential to consider the impact of his behavior on the group. If he's not willing to address his issues, it may be necessary to set boundaries or limit his involvement in group activities. You can't force someone to change, but you can create an environment that encourages growth and respect for others.\n4. **Other substances**: It's crucial to address the use of other substances, like mushrooms and pot, as well. While some group members may use these substances responsibly, it's essential to ensure that everyone is aware of the risks and boundaries. You can have an open conversation about responsible use and set guidelines for group activities.\n5. **Communication is key**: As the person who handles interpersonal conflicts, it's essential to have a clear and direct conversation with your friend about the issues. Be specific about the behaviors that were problematic and how they affected others. Encourage him to seek help and provide resources for support.\n6. **Boundary-setting**: It's reasonable to set boundaries for the group, such as requiring someone to be sober for a certain period before rejoining the group. You can also establish rules for substance use during group activities, such as designating sober areas or having designated drivers.\n7. **Support for recovery**: If your friend is willing to seek help, consider offering support and resources for his recovery. This can include connecting him with local support groups, providing emotional support, or helping him find resources for treatment.\n\nIn terms of advice from people in recovery, here are a few key takeaways:\n\n* **Encourage honesty and transparency**: People in recovery often value honesty and transparency. Encourage your friend to be open about his struggles and progress.\n* **Set clear boundaries**: Establishing clear boundaries can help create a safe and respectful environment for everyone involved.\n* **Focus on the present, not the past**: While it's essential to acknowledge past behaviors, it's crucial to focus on the present and future. Encourage your friend to focus on his recovery and personal growth.\n* **Respect the journey**: Recovery is a journey, and it's essential to respect your friend's progress and setbacks. Avoid being too judgmental or critical, as this can hinder his progress.\n\nRemember that there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's essential to approach this situation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to adapt. By setting clear boundaries, encouraging honesty, and providing support, you can help create a positive and respectful environment for everyone involved."

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and stressed. Dealing with unfair treatment from family members can be really tough. Here are some tips that might help you navigate this situation and minimize conflict until you move out:\n\n1. **Practice self-reflection**: Take some time to think about your own actions and reactions. Are there any areas where you can improve? Are there any triggers that make you react impulsively? Being aware of your own emotions and behaviors can help you respond more thoughtfully.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establishing clear boundaries can help prevent conflicts. When you feel like your siblings are being disrespectful, calmly and firmly tell them how their behavior is affecting you. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, \"I feel disrespected when you talk to me like that. Can we please communicate respectfully?\"\n3. **Use \"gray rock\" technique**: When interacting with your siblings, try to remain calm and neutral, like a gray rock in the middle of a river. Avoid taking the bait and reacting impulsively. This can help de-escalate conflicts and make it harder for your siblings to provoke you.\n4. **Document incidents**: Keep a journal or log of incidents where you feel like you've been treated unfairly. This can help you track patterns and provide evidence if needed. However, avoid confronting your parents with the evidence, as this can escalate the situation.\n5. **Communicate with your parents separately**: Try to have one-on-one conversations with your parents about your feelings and concerns. Avoid blaming or accusing language, and focus on your own emotions and experiences. This can help them understand your perspective and potentially lead to more empathy and understanding.\n6. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help you cope with stress and anxiety.\n7. **Plan for your departure**: Since you're moving out in a few months, start making a plan for how you'll handle the transition. Talk to your parents about your plans and expectations for maintaining a relationship after you leave. This can help them prepare and potentially reduce stress for everyone involved.\n8. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, a therapist, or a trusted adult (like a counselor or teacher) for emotional support and guidance. Having a support system can make a big difference in dealing with stressful family situations.\n\nRemember, you can't control how your family members behave, but you can control how you respond to them. By prioritizing your own well-being and setting boundaries, you can minimize conflict and create a more peaceful environment until you move out.\n\nI hope these tips help you navigate this challenging situation. Remember to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through this. You got this!"

Since your parents are new to the US, it's understandable that they might not be familiar with the financial landscape here. Here are some financial measures you can take to prepare for a secure future:\n\n1. **Open a savings account**: As soon as possible, open a savings account in your name. This will help you develop a habit of saving and give you a place to store your money. You can also consider opening a high-yield savings account to earn a higher interest rate.\n2. **Start small**: Don't worry if you can't save a lot initially. Start with small amounts, even $5 or $10 a week. The key is to be consistent and make it a habit.\n3. **Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts**: Look into tax-advantaged accounts such as Roth IRAs or 529 plans, which can help you save for education expenses or retirement. These accounts have specific rules and benefits, so make sure to research and understand how they work.\n4. **Build an emergency fund**: Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will help you cover unexpected expenses, such as car repairs or medical bills, without going into debt.\n5. **Prioritize needs over wants**: Be honest with yourself about what you need versus what you want. Make sure to prioritize essential expenses, like tuition or living expenses, over discretionary spending, like entertainment or hobbies.\n6. **Educate yourself**: Continuously learn about personal finance, investing, and money management. Websites like The Balance, NerdWallet, and Investopedia are great resources to start with.\n7. **Talk to a financial advisor**: If possible, consider speaking with a financial advisor or a trusted adult who can provide guidance on your specific situation. They can help you create a personalized plan for your financial future.\n8. **Stay organized**: Keep track of your finances using a budgeting app, spreadsheet, or planner. This will help you stay on top of your spending and make adjustments as needed.\n9. **Avoid high-interest debt**: Be cautious of high-interest credit cards or loans. Try to avoid them or pay them off quickly to avoid accumulating debt.\n10. **Be patient and disciplined**: Building a secure financial future takes time and discipline. Stay committed to your goals and avoid getting caught up in get-rich-quick schemes or impulse purchases.\n\nAs you start your financial journey, remember that it's okay to make mistakes. The key is to learn from them and stay committed to your goals.\n\nFor your parents, I recommend encouraging them to:\n\n* Research and understand the US tax system and how it applies to their situation\n* Consider consulting with a financial advisor or accountant to get personalized advice\n* Open their own savings accounts or investment accounts to start building their own financial foundation\n\nRemember to have open and honest conversations with your parents about your financial goals and concerns.

A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms, work through underlying issues, and provide you with a safe space to process your emotions. However, I understand your reluctance, so let's explore some alternatives and strategies that might help.\n\n1. Self-reflection and journaling: Take time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Writing down your emotions can help you identify patterns, triggers, and areas where you can improve. This can be a great way to develop self-awareness and empathy.\n2. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Regular mindfulness practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, can help you manage stress and anxiety. This can reduce the frequency and intensity of your mood swings. You can find guided recordings and apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer to get started.\n3. Boundary setting: Learn to recognize and respect your limits. Set boundaries with others to protect yourself from toxic relationships and situations that trigger your mood swings. This can be challenging, but it's essential for your well-being.\n4. Self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and fulfillment. This can be exercise, creative pursuits, or spending time in nature. Make time for self-care and prioritize it.\n5. Education and resources: Read books, articles, and online resources about emotional intelligence, empathy, and mental health. This can help you develop a better understanding of yourself and others.\n6. Support network: Surround yourself with people who are supportive, understanding, and non-judgmental. Having a strong support network can make a significant difference in your mental health journey.\n7. Small steps: Focus on making small, incremental changes. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Start with one area, like journaling or mindfulness, and gradually build upon it.\n\nRemember, improving your mental health takes time, patience, and effort. It's essential to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that setbacks are a natural part of the process.\n\nRegarding apologizing after a breakdown, I understand your fear. It can be daunting to confront the aftermath of a toxic outburst. However, apologizing and making amends can be a crucial step towards healing and rebuilding relationships. It's not about seeking validation or forgiveness but about taking responsibility for your actions and showing empathy towards others.\n\nRemember, you are not your mood swings. You are a complex, multifaceted person with the capacity for growth, change, and improvement. Keep in mind that small steps can lead to significant progress over time.\n\nLastly, while I understand your concerns about seeking professional help, I want to reiterate that it's not a sign of weakness.

I used to be kind of a party girl, but I haven't drank or smoked since the moment I found out I was pregnant, and have no intention to going back. \n\nI had nothing growing up, and I desperately want better for her. I am doing everything that I possibly can to try and make life better for her, but I feel like my boyfriend has been working against me every step of the way and I am absolutely exhausted with it. \n\nWhen I was pregnant we lived in a crappy apartment in a crappy neighborhood. I didn't want our child growing up there, so I got online and I found a nicer place for us in a much nicer town, and I did the math and realized we could afford it as long as we were both working, and we would still be able to put a little into savings. I explained that all to my boyfriend and he said he supported it and wanted to move somewhere better for our daughter's sake, too. He said he would do everything he could to support us. \n\nSo we moved, and it was fine at first. And then he came home one day two months after we moved in and told me he got fired. When I asked him what happened he said that he got into a fight with his boss and they fired him over it, but the boss hated him and tried to make it happen. I know shitty bosses are a thing, so I told him it was fine as long as he got another job as quickly as he could. I managed to cover our rent by borrowing from the tiny savings account we had at that point. \n\nHe did get another job after a few weeks in a warehouse, and I thought we would be fine. But after two months there he got fired again, this time because he said someone saw him smoke a little pot, which got him in trouble because he was supposed to be driving a forklift. I admit, I lost my temper a little bit on him that time, which probably didn't make anything better, but I was under huge stress from working my own job, being pregnant, and then having to pay all the bills again. \n\nHe got another job, this time in food service. That went alright for a while. Restaurant jobs suck, but he was able to bring home some money and I thought we were good. \n\nThen, two months after our daughter was born, he got a fucking DUI.

It wiped out every dime in our savings account for all the fines, plus we had to put an interlock on our car (which also cost $75 a month), which was really fucking humiliating when I was driving it. \n\nHe promised me he would straighten out after that. He looked me and our daughter in the eyes and promised he would do better for her.\n\nFor a little while, he did. He worked, he came home after, and it seemed like we were going to get through everything. \n\nBut last night he wrecked our car, and got a second DUI.

I called the sheriff's phone number and they would not tell me why, but did confirm that he had been arrested. He called me this morning from jail and told me it was another DUI. He also told me he had wrecked the car. I know it was really mean, but I just hung up the phone on him. I just couldn't handle it. \n\nI feel like I am just fucking broken.

I want to support you both, but I feel like I'm getting pulled into the middle of your conflicts. Can we find a way to resolve this amicably and move forward?\"\n\nIt's possible that your friends will listen to your concerns and make an effort to improve their communication. However, if the behavior persists, it might be time to reevaluate the dynamics of your friendships. Ask yourself:\n\n* Are these friendships truly nourishing and positive in your life?\n* Are you getting more stress and drama than joy and support from these relationships?\n* Is it worth maintaining these friendships if they're consistently draining your energy?\n\nRemember, you deserve to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you. If the conflicts between your friends are affecting your well-being, it might be time to set some boundaries or reevaluate the relationships.\n\nLastly, take care of yourself during this process. Prioritize self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and focus on nurturing relationships that are positive and uplifting."

    "sentence": "My fiance is a kind, hard-working guy who is generally sweet and loving. When I met him he was several years out from a period of time when he had been forcefully hospitalized after a period of SSRI induced mania. \n\nHe hasnt had a hospitalization since that time (about 10 years ago now), but after his hospitilization he was effectively disowned by a few members of his family and lost several friends. This seems to have left him with some deep wounds concerning rejection and abandonment. Since we have been dating (about 3 years now), he has worked with  a great trauma/EMDR therapist who has helped him substantially begin the process of addressing these wounds. I have watched him heal relationships with several family members and become happy and more peaceful in general. However, the wounds still seem to cause periodic \"episodes\" that occur every 2-3 months. Typically, some form of perceived rejection triggers him to feel as though he is being severely rejected or abandoned and he freaks out. Most recently, a combo of a friend posting a video of him online and a house guest who overstayed their welcome caused him to have an episode where he yelled at me, telling me he couldnt handle having friends over anymore, he wanted to beat the crap out of the friend who posted the video, our relationship was over and he just wanted to die. He vascillated between super angry and super self loathing. Basically, a very intense emotional rollercoaster. I had to abandon my plans for the evening to try to calm him down which took several hours. \n\nHe is always very apologetic after an episode and typically ramps up therapy/self work to try to stabilize, but so far that work hasnt led to an actual end of these episodes. \n\nOn top of all of this, I am unexpectedly pregnant. We had actually talked about trying to get pregnant next year, but this was not the timeline we had planned. We are getting ready to start couples counseling that we planned to prep for parenthood. I had really felt that this extra year of therapy and healing would potentially go a long way towards helping him prepare for fatherhood and that it would give me time to assess the situation and decide if we were really ready. \n\nSo I guess the situation I am in now is one of wondering if having a baby with someone who is occasionally emotionally unstable is an insane thing to do. I know lots of people who arent emotionally well have kids, but my parents were some of those people and really dont want to repeat their mistake of subjecting my kids to my partners emotional outbursts. We are financially stable, own a home and by all accounts would be good parents, but I just cant seem to see how we can parent when he isnt healthy yet. But I tend to be someone who overanalyzes/ worries excessively, so perhaps this is also an over reaction to a problem that is perhaps not common, but not as horrible as I think. When we were discussing whether to move forward with the pregnancy for the 8000th time recently, he asked me to please just \"believe in him\" and his ability to be a good dad. He has always wanted to be a dad, has 10 nieces and nephews he has spent lots of time with and admittedly is wonderful with kids. I just am having such a hard time believing for some reason. \n\nAdditionally, I am super concerned about being able to conceive in the future. With me being older, if we dont have kids now, we may blow our only real chance. Perhaps in a year, conceiving wont be as easy (although we have both had fertility tested about a year ago and were fine). \n\nOverall, I am just at a deadlock in this decision. Time is also running out before the decision will be made for me by insane abortion laws in my state. \n\nTL;DR : I am torn about having a baby with my partner, who is not the most emotionally stable guy but who deeply wants to have kids.",
    "human": "&gt;he has spent lots of time with and admittedly is wonderful with kids. I just am having such a hard time believing for some reason.\n\nI had a boyfriend (on/off for 8 years) who was like this.  Angry a lot, and once every so often he'd flip out like a monster.  He was also very good with children.  (No kids himself, but lots of nieces and nephews.)  He just had excellent parental instincts.\n\nHowever...the kids were all aware that he could get extremely angry.  \n\nSo, there's your problem.  It doesn't matter how good he is with children if he still flips out 1% of the time.  That 1% will affect your kids profoundly.   (I had a dad like this, and while eventually he stopped having fits of black rage, this did not happen till I was in my thirties.)\n\nPlease don't subject a child to your fiancé's anger.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and the complexity of your situation. It's great that you're taking the time to think critically about this decision and considering the potential impact on your future together.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your partner's emotional instability is not something that will magically resolve itself, especially given the severity of his past experiences. While he's made progress, his episodes are still a significant concern for you and your future together.\n\nRegarding your concerns about being a good parent, it's natural to worry about exposing your children to emotional outbursts. However, it's also important to recognize that every parent has their own set of challenges, and emotional instability is not unique to your partner. Many parents face various struggles, and it's how they navigate and cope with those challenges that matters.\n\nThat being said, having a baby with someone who is still working on their emotional stability might put additional pressure on your relationship and your ability to co-parent. It's crucial to consider whether your partner is willing to continue working on his emotional well-being and whether you feel supported in your own emotional journey as a parent.\n\nRegarding the pressure to conceive, it's understandable that you're concerned about your age and the potential impact on your fertility. However, it's essential to remember that fertility is unpredictable, and even with fertility testing, there's no guarantee of success. You may want to explore alternative options, such as freezing eggs or embryos, or consider adoption.\n\nIn terms of your decision, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider what's best for you and your future together. You may want to consider having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and fears. Ask him to commit to continuing his therapy and self-work, and discuss how you can support each other through the challenges of parenthood.\n\nUltimately, the decision to have a baby is a personal one, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional readiness and well-being. You may want to take some time to reflect on what you're willing to tolerate and what you're not, and have an open conversation with your partner about your concerns and expectations.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, and it's essential to consider what's best for you and your future together."

That's really admirable that you're willing to acknowledge and work on it.\n\nFirstly, let's break it down: it's normal to have moments where we come across as self-centered or snobby, even if that's not our intention. It's often due to our tone, language, and body language. So, here are some tips to help you shift the focus away from yourself:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with others, make an effort to truly listen to what they're saying. Avoid interrupting, nodding along, and instead, ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share more. This will help you focus on the other person and show that you value their thoughts.\n2. **Use \"we\" instead of \"I\": When sharing your thoughts or experiences, try using \"we\" instead of \"I.\" This can help shift the focus from your individual perspective to a more collective or shared experience. For example, instead of saying \"I love hiking,\" say \"We love hiking, don't you?\"\n3. **Ask for others' opinions**: Show genuine interest in others' opinions and ask for their thoughts. This can help shift the attention away from yourself and create a sense of mutual respect.\n4. **Avoid dominating conversations**: Be mindful of how much you're talking and make an effort to let others contribute. Avoid interrupting or talking over others, and try to summarize what they've said to show you're actively listening.\n5. **Body language matters**: Make eye contact, use open and relaxed body language, and avoid crossing your arms or legs, which can give the impression you're closed off or defensive.\n6. **Practice humility**: Acknowledge when you're not sure about something or when someone else has a better perspective. This shows you're open to learning and willing to grow.\n7. **Reflect on your language**: Pay attention to your tone and language. Avoid using phrases that start with \"I'm the only one who...\" or \"I'm the only one who thinks...\". Instead, focus on shared experiences or common ground.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to develop new habits. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Just acknowledge the moment and adjust your approach.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that it's great you're aware of this pattern and willing to work on it. That's already a huge step forward! Keep in mind that you're not selfish, and it's okay to have moments where you come across that way. The key is to be self-aware, empathetic, and willing to grow.\n\nDo you have any specific situations or conversations that make you feel like you're coming across as snobby or selfish?

    "base_reply": "The age-old conundrum! It's great that you're thinking carefully about this. Here are some general rules of thumb to help you navigate these situations:\n\n1. **Consider the intention behind the offer**: Is your friend genuinely trying to help, or are they just being polite? Pay attention to their body language, tone, and words. If they seem hesitant or apologetic, it might be a genuine offer. If they're being too eager or insistent, it might be a polite gesture.\n2. **Assess your financial situation**: Be honest with yourself about your current financial situation. If you're struggling to make ends meet, it's okay to accept help occasionally. However, if you're consistently accepting help, it might be a sign that you need to re-evaluate your budget.\n3. **Set boundaries**: Establishing boundaries can be tough, but it's essential. Decide what you're comfortable accepting and what you're not. If someone offers to pay for something, you can say, \"Thank you so much, but I've got this one covered. Maybe next time?\"\n4. **Return the favor**: When you do accept help, make sure to return the favor in some way. This can be as simple as paying for their lunch or helping them with a task. This way, you're maintaining the balance of give-and-take in the friendship.\n5. **Communicate openly**: If you're unsure about accepting help, it's better to communicate openly with your friend. You can say, \"I appreciate the offer, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my expenses right now. Maybe we can find another way to split the cost?\"\n6. **Don't feel obligated**: Remember that you don't owe anyone a favor just because they're willing to help. It's okay to say no or decline an offer if it doesn't feel right for you.\n7. **Show appreciation**: When someone does offer to help, be sure to express gratitude and acknowledge their kindness. A simple \"thank you\" or acknowledgement can go a long way in maintaining a healthy dynamic.\n\nSome specific guidelines for the scenarios you mentioned:\n\n* Paying for gas after a ride: If you're comfortable with it, you can accept the offer. If not, you can say, \"Thanks for the offer, but I've got this one covered.\"\n* Paying for ingredients after dinner: If you're the host, you can accept the offer as a gesture of appreciation for their contribution to the meal. If you're a guest, you can say, \"Thank you for the offer, but I'm happy to contribute next time.\"\n* Paying for drinks: If you're the one who paid most of the drinks, you can say, \"Thanks for the offer, but I think we can split it evenly this time.\"\n\nRemember, these are just guidelines.

    "sentence": "My (32M) fiancee (31F) have been together for 7 years, engaged for about 4 months. My mom (70) is staying with us for the week of the holidays.\n\n\nSome backstory first (Apologies if this gets long).\n\n\nNow, like lots of other people my relationship with my mom is complicated. We love each other and have gone through a lot together (she was a single mom for a chunk of my life, we moved countries together, etc.) She's very stubborn, hard headed, and takes disagreements very personally. She's also very caring and kind, but all that accumulated means she can be very overbearing. I don't have enough time or space to paint the full picture of who she is, but to keep it simple, we love each other a lot, but fight a lot.\n\n\nMy fiancee's relationship with my mom is on the surface okay, but there have been conflicts. I think overall my mom likes my fiancee and has never voiced (to me) any displeasure or complaints about me being with her or getting engaged. She's always been (to me) supportive of our relationship and regularly tells me how wonderful my fiancee is.\n\n\nNow, my fiancee has always been kind to my mom, but even from the beginning the relationship between them wasn't this wholesome open arms thing I had hoped for, it's always been a little cold. Our first year of dating, the first time my mom visited (I had already met my future in laws), we lived in a studio apartment together. I told my mom, and I should've checked with my fiancee, that she could stay with us. Once I told my fiancee, the response was bad, she didn't want her staying there because \"there's no space\". This felt cold to me, because my mom is then only person I have in my life outside of a couple friends. Had it been the other way around, I wouldn't have batted an eye at her mom staying with us. But fair enough, I fucked up not checking first. So we booked my mom a hotel room nearby, but there's no way my mom felt good about it, although she never said anything to me.\n\n\nOver the next few years, things have been a little tumultuous. A couple times my mom has insulted my fiancee. Once, my mom asked fiancee how she wanted certain things organized in the kitchen, fiancee explained how and added that that's how her grandma taught her, so she's been doing it every since. According to fiancee, my mom then did it differently. Fiancee's parents are from another country (let's say Colombia), but she was born here. My mom was on the phone with someone who was asking about my fiancee, my mom said some nice things, described her accurately, but added \"she's kind of a \"fake\" Colombian, her parents are from there\". Now, my mom's english is very good, but she sometimes says things that aren't quite normal in terms of grammar and whatnot. In my opinion, this was a case of that issue, she put her foot in her mouth. Another time I remember my mom \"correcting\" my fiancee when fiancee was explaining something about Colombia. Fiancee is very sensitive about her heritage, and this obviously didn't sit well. wether my mom was correct or not about the info itself is besides the point. \n\n\nSo when Fiancee is a little \"cold\", some of it is obviously from these things that have bothered her in the past, more of it is no doubt due to my own fights with my mom (it no doubt affects your view of MiL if your SO is constantly fighting with her). But I also don't know how much of it is dislike of who my mom is, her personality, etc. \n\nMost of my fights with my mom are over really stupid things, which is really frustrating. For example, two days ago we're all watching a movie. Paul Dano shows up, and my mom says \"this actor always plays a bad guy\", I answer \"not always, but yeah a lot of the time\", she replies \"I've only seen him do these roles, I've only seen him in like two movies.\" Now, she's seen him in many movies, because I've watched those movies with her, including Swiss Army Man where Dano doesn't play a bad guy/creep. So I tell her \"you've seen him in lots of movies, even as a good guy\". She gets mad and starts telling me \"No I haven't. How would you know what I've watched?\" I mention specific movies, and she gets angrier and angrier, telling me that I'm making things up etc, that I'm always implying that she's stupid, etc, essentially acting like I was gaslighting her when it was really the other way around. It was a really stupid fight for no reason, it should've ended with her just saying \"ai don't remember\" or whatever. We have arguments like that all the time. From my point is view, the root cause is a constant miscommunication of intent. When she wants to advise me, it comes across as her criticizing. When I want to say my opinion or whatever and they differ, she takes it as an attack or as if I'm telling her she's wrong. This happens over and over.\n\n\nSo, understandably, regardless of wether my mom is generally nice to my fiancee, my fiancee ends up witnessing this stuff and it no doubt affects her perception of my mom. Any time that they have some sort of, what I perceive as miscommunication, I end up making excuses for both of them. \"I don't think my mom meant it that way, but you're right that it was hurtful\" or \"my fiancee just needs space, she's introverted and it's not personal\" or whatever. \n\nSo cut to the problem at hand. Last night fiancee comes home from work, says hello, and goes upstairs to change. She's taking a minute, so I go up to say hi again and open the door to catch her on the phone with her mom. They're discussing what seems to be serious family stuff, so I leave and close the door again. About an hour goes by and I need to grab something from the room, so I go up and, not wanting to barge in during a bad moment, put my ear to the door to see if it's a good moment. \n\nTo my surprise, I overhear my fiancee talking to her mom about my mom. I hear these snippets: \"She's getting even more controlling...\" \"they started fighting again, over nothing, but they're sitting across from each other so I don't wanna sit in the middle, so I ate my breakfast in the kitchen and just left...\" \"Every time I bring up wedding stuff it's like she doesn't want to hear it. When we called her about the proposal, she wasn't excited, she basically just said 'about time's and smiled, but that's it...\" There were other things said, but I wasn't gonna stay there eaves dropping .\n\nSo two things happened upon hearing this. First, once again it seemed to me like something was being misinterpreted. When we called my mom about the engagement, she was happy. I know she was happy, because I've known my mom my whole life. She was happy and excited, but she also wasn't surprised because I'd been showing her the ring and talking to her about it. But she was happy. Again, never has she been unsupportive of my relationship. One thing she doesn't meddle in much is my relationships, however in contrast to this relationship, she disapproved of my ex, and while she didn't meddle, it's night and day.\n\nThe other thing that happened was that I felt betrayed. I felt like it's none of her parents business what my relationship with my mom is like, and any fights we have are private. It felt to me like a huge breach of trust to overhear my fiancee not only telling her mom about our fights, but almost putting her own spin on things \"she wasn't happy about the proposal\", \"I think she doesn't like...\" adding intentions to my mom's actions that I don't feel are accurate. It feels horrible to know that she's been saying things to her parents all this time, painting a bad picture of my mom and my relationship with her. Some of her issues are fair, but it seems like she then assumes the worst of my mom even when that intention isn't there.\n\nOne of the fights my mom and I had last year, my mom commented that my fiancee despised her. I mad excuses, convinced she was wrong. Now, I'm wondering if she was right.\n\nI'm tired of making excuses for both of them, and after hearing my fiancee gossiping, I'm starting to not know who to trust, who to believe. I don't know if I'm right that it's mostly miscommunication, idk if I'm wrong and my mom has intentionally hurt my fiancee despite me seeing no disapproval, Idk if my fiancee actually despises my mom,  Idk of she spreading exaggerations about my mom and my relationship with her, idk of she should she even be spreading info about my mom and I at all. I'm incredibly hurt having overheard her. I feel lost, betrayed, unknowing who to trust, believe, unknowing of who is telling me the truth, who's lyring, etc. It really put me in a bad place.\n\nSorry if this is long, It's hard to post such complicated dynamics, and the last thing I want is people offering advice who also are missing context, misinterpreting, etc.\n\nHow should I approach these issues in the future? I told my fiancee what I heard and that I felt very hurt, and her response was to say \"I don't know what you think you heard\" and tell me that I say things about her parents too. We haven't been able to discuss further because my mom is still here. I'm unsure of how to try and mend these relationships, and I'm unsure of how to avoid misunderstandings (if that's what's going on).\n\nTLDR: Caught my fiancee talking about my mom and my relationship with her being my back to MiL, some of which was factual and some which were fiancee's own interpretations of my mom's actions and intentions. I feel very hurt by the lack of privacy, and feel she broke my trust by spreading personal things. I'm unsure how to move forward to improve our relationship as well as theirs.",

    "base_reply": "Wow, thank you for sharing this incredibly detailed and nuanced account of your complex family dynamics. I'm not surprised that you're feeling lost, hurt, and unsure of what to do.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you've been carrying a significant emotional burden by constantly making excuses for both your mom and your fiancée. It's understandable that you want to maintain harmony, but it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries.\n\nRegarding the situation at hand, it's clear that your fiancée's conversation with her mom was a breach of trust. It's natural to feel hurt and betrayed when someone shares personal, private information without your consent. You have every right to be upset, and it's essential to communicate your feelings to your fiancée.\n\nWhen you confronted your fiancée, her response (\"I don't know what you think you heard\") is concerning. It's possible that she's not acknowledging her actions or is minimizing the situation. This may indicate that she's not taking your feelings seriously or is not willing to have an honest conversation.\n\nTo move forward, I suggest having an open and honest conversation with your fiancée about your feelings and concerns. You've already taken the first step by sharing your perspective, so try to approach the conversation calmly and assertively. You might say something like:\n\n\"I feel hurt and betrayed when I overheard you talking to your mom about our relationship with my mom. I understand that you were discussing family issues, but it felt like you were sharing private information about us without my consent. I want us to be on the same page and work together to maintain healthy relationships with our families. Can we find a way to communicate more openly and honestly about our feelings and concerns?\"\n\nIt's essential to set clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship, including how you'll handle conflicts and personal discussions. You may also want to discuss how you can work together to improve your relationships with your mom and your fiancée's parents.\n\nRemember that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to the situation. By prioritizing open communication, empathy, and respect, you can work towards healing and growth in your relationships.\n\nAs for your mom, it's crucial to have a separate conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. You may want to express your hurt and frustration about her behavior, but also acknowledge that you love and care about her deeply. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her actions have on you and your fiancée, and a calm, honest conversation may help clear the air.\n\nLastly, take care of yourself during this challenging time. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being. Consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed."

Here's a suggestion:\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that you've been trying to be nice and respectful towards this coach, which is a great effort. However, it's understandable that you don't want to come across as weak or socially awkward. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Continue being professional and courteous towards the coach, but with a slight adjustment: focus on being respectful and kind, rather than overly nice. This means maintaining a professional tone and demeanor, but not going out of your way to seek their approval or validation.\n2. Set clear boundaries: When interacting with the coach, be clear and direct about your intentions and expectations. For example, if you're asking for feedback on your form, specify what you're looking for and what you're willing to work on. This shows that you're proactive and self-motivated, rather than relying on their approval.\n3. Practice assertive communication: When responding to the coach's passive-aggressive comments or actions, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs. For instance, if they make a snide comment, you could say, \"I feel frustrated when I'm spoken to in that tone. Can we focus on the exercise at hand?\" This helps to diffuse tension and maintain a sense of control.\n4. Focus on your own goals and progress: Instead of seeking validation from the coach, focus on your own fitness goals and progress. Celebrate your achievements and acknowledge your efforts, rather than relying on external approval.\n5. Consider speaking with a gym manager or another authority figure: If the coach's behavior continues to affect your experience at the gym, it may be helpful to speak with someone in a higher authority. They can address the issue and help resolve any misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, you don't need to change who you are or how you interact with others to please someone who's being passive-aggressive.

I can use the same machine for one or two hours (I usually take three hour sessions in total) without anybody else waiting for me to finish and often there isn't anybody else in the first place. (Mostly running or other repetitive things).\n\nRecently I have been approached by people that are making me very uncomfortable. They insist on asking questions about me, my work, my salary and don't seem to take kindly me not willing to answer al talk at all. They grab stuff from my bag (like my brush when I am done with it, they then use it on their own hair and give it back to me but it still grosses me out and it's unnerving).\n\nI just want to be left alone, but I don't want to lose the place that has been my coping mechanism for so long.\n\nWhat should I do?",

Your neurodivergent nature is a part of who you are, and it's okay to need time alone to recharge.\n\nGiven the recent incidents, I'd suggest taking a few steps to set boundaries and maintain your comfort level:\n\n1. **Talk to the gym staff**: Let them know about the issues you're facing. They might be able to provide guidance on how to handle these situations or even offer to escort you to your car or provide an escort service during late-night hours.\n2. **Be more mindful of your belongings**: Consider keeping your bag or personal items close to you, especially if you're concerned about people touching or taking your belongings. You could also label your bag or items with your name to discourage others from touching them.\n3. **Find alternative times to go to the gym**: If the late-night hours are becoming too stressful, consider visiting the gym during less busy hours, like early morning or lunchtime. This might help you avoid unwanted interactions.\n4. **Practice assertive communication**: If someone approaches you again, you can politely but firmly say, \"I'm trying to focus on my workout right now. Can we catch up another time?\" or \"I'd prefer not to discuss my personal life, if that's okay.\" Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own comfort.\n5. **Explore other options**: If the gym is becoming too overwhelming, it might be time to explore alternative spaces that offer a similar atmosphere. You could look into other 24/7 gyms, yoga studios, or even online workout platforms that cater to your needs.\n\nRemember, your well-being is essential, and it's okay to prioritize it. Don't compromise on your comfort and safety just to maintain a routine. Take care of yourself and find a balance that works for you."

    "sentence": "My wife and I have always been very different. I'm a complex bag of philosophy and thoughts about the future; she's a simpler person who prefers action to conversation, and who reminisces about the past. We've both changed over the past 11 years, but my change has been the most dramatic. My mental health has improved and deteriorated in cycles, as has my weight and self-esteem. I was a devout Christian when she and I met, and now I'm an agnostic, bordering on full-blown atheism.\n\nShe had a really rough childhood. Change scares her quite a bit, so seeing me become someone different hasn't been easy for her. If she was following the church's teachings, she probably would have left me by now; she's tried her best to be understanding. She wears her emotions on her sleeve, but she's a good mother to our two kids, and a good person overall.\n\nThere's no one at fault for anything here. What she and I want from our relationship are just diametrically opposed. We don't meet each other's needs, and we try to make up for that by buying stuff that the other wants, but for me, it only seems to highlight just how desperate I am for someone that gets me. When we do try to address the gulf between us, it ends in unproductive conflict and meaningless apologies. We don't want to hurt each other, we want to be there for each other, but we just don't. After 11 years of increasing distance, I don't see that changing.\n\nI don't want to hurt her. She's said numerous times how much she just \"couldn't do life\" without me. She would truly be in a bad way if we did divorce or separate: she dropped out of high school and doesn't have her GED, my income is comfortable but nowhere near enough to support two households, and she hasn't had a job in the 11 years we've been married. This is to say nothing of the emotional damage it would do to her; I don't want her to feel like she's been abandoned *yet again.* Not to mention the kids: I know my son would probably understand, as divorce is pretty much the norm these days. I could honestly and truthfully explain to him that his mom and I just needed what we could not provide to each other. It would be hard on our autistic daughter, though.\n\nI think the worst part of it is that I'm starting to justify to myself why seeking out an affair wouldn't be the worst thing. I've mentioned to her before that I wouldn't be upset if we needed to see other people while remaining married, but she vehemently opposes that option (which I'll admit has caused some resentment from me, as our sex life has been nearly dead for years). If I could just share a connection with *someone*, I'd be a better partner, I'd take the burden of pleasing me off of her. I know it wouldn't be that way. I'd feel enormously guilty, and if she ever found out, it would devastate her.\n\nI thought I was willing to sacrifice my happiness for her. I thought I could do it to give my kids a stable home with two parents, but...I don't think I can anymore. I hate myself for being so weak, I hate that I don't feel like I can tell her any of this. I'm not even optimistic that I *could* find someone to share a connection with if I did leave her. I'm an ugly, overweight awkward nerd with persistent suicidal thoughts.\n\nAnd I hate that I'm here, spilling out this twisted, melodramatic mess. I'm sitting at work, but I just want to go to the bathroom and cry. There's no good option; I'm going to hurt myself by suppressing all of this, or I'm going to hurt a lot of people *and* myself for saying this out loud.\n\nThe happiness in our relationship is gone, and I don't think it's coming back. What do I do now?\n\n**tl;dr** Long marriage, 2 kids, I've changed, don't want to hurt her, but lonely, bored and feeling unloved.\n\nEDIT: To everyone telling me to talk to her, I am, and I have. I did not mention in my original word eruption, but we're both feeling the distance. We've had countless discussions about our incompatibility, our wildly different needs in mental stimulation, shared experiences, sexual needs, religion...it hasn't been a silent 11 years. Lots of fights (no violence, thankfully). Lots of dead ends. We've both threatened divorce in our own ways at some point during those years. I didn't mention this, partly because I was a blubbering mess of humanity a few hours ago, but because it's impossible to sum up 11 years in one post. It hasn't all been bad, but what is bad feels overwhelming now.",

Ask yourself:\n\n1. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What are you willing to compromise on, and what are you not?\n2. What are your expectations from your wife, and are they realistic?\n3. What kind of connection and intimacy are you craving, and can you find it outside of your current relationship?\n4. How do you envision your future, and what steps can you take to move towards it?\n\nIt may be helpful to seek the guidance of a therapist or counselor who can help you explore these questions and develop a plan for moving forward. They can also provide support and resources to help you navigate the complexities of your situation.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle. There are people who care about you and want to help. Take the time you need to process your emotions and make a decision that aligns with your values and priorities.\n\nLastly, please don't beat yourself up over your feelings. You're not weak for wanting connection and intimacy. You're human, and it's natural to crave these things. Be kind to yourself, and remember that you're doing the best you can in a difficult situation."

We've been friends for like a year and been together for another year, so I knew his love of football and the fact it was his hobby before we got together, but I didn't realise how much. \n\nNow, I love that he has hobbies and it's great to like things outside of each other, but I really hate football. I don't like the general football community and the hatred it can bring (fully aware that's not how everyone treats football, just what you see on Twitter is always negative, but lovely for the people it brings together) and I don't really wanna watch it or talk about it if I can avoid it. \n\nHe also plays football for a local team on weekends, which again is great, but it means that most/every weekend there is at least one football thing on, whether it's a big match on TV or a local match that he wants me to go to. I feel bad missing them since he plays and he wants me there, but it's just not how I want to spend my Saturday mornings. He also gets mad and a little weird at football, as it does tend to make people angry if they're losing or something, and it's just not a side of him I want to see. \n\nHe also plays football videogames a lot in the evenings, which I don't hate, but again there's a lot of yelling and it's not even a video game I can play or get involved in, since I know nothing about it and I'm not good at it. \n\nI don't even think his football schedule is as hectic as some other people's, but I'm kinda sick of my weekends being taken over by a sport I don't care about. If we're not watching it at home he's watching it on his tablet while we're out, or he goes to the live matches and comes home hours later really drunk with all his football friends. \n\nWe also don't live together, and when he visits me nine times out of ten his visit ends when the football is happening, so he goes home to watch them play live. When I visit him, he goes and does all his usual football stuff. I mostly go to his matches when he plays but I've never been to the proper league ones. \n\nMaybe I'm being too mean and getting annoyed over a reasonable hobby, but I'm a little sick of sharing his attention, especially on weekends where we could actually be doing something. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend really likes football and I really hate it.

However, it's also important to communicate your feelings and boundaries with your boyfriend. Have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Be specific about what's bothering you - it's not just about the football itself, but the way it's taking over your weekends and the negative emotions that come with it.\n\nYou could say something like, \"Hey, I love that you have your own interests and hobbies, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by how much football is taking over our weekends.

Maybe we can find other activities to do together on weekends, or I can join you for some of the matches you play in?\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that his love for football is not going to change, so you need to find ways to accommodate it without sacrificing your own needs and desires. You could suggest alternative ways for him to enjoy his football, like watching games or playing video games with friends during the week, so that weekends can be reserved for other activities.\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship. By expressing your feelings and needs, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you. And who knows, you might even discover some common interests or activities that you can do together!\n\nLastly, try not to take his love for football personally. It's not about you, and it's okay to have different interests. It's about finding a balance and making time for each other."

Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or a quick meditation to calm your nerves.\n6. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" or \"I'm not interested in discussing this\" when someone is trying to stir up a reaction. Your emotional well-being is important, and you don't owe anyone a reaction.\n7. **Practice self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and fulfillment. A happy, fulfilled you is better equipped to handle life's stressors and less likely to take things personally.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to change your mindset. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work on developing this new habit.

I'm afraid of them judging me and therefore I am unable to just be myself. How can I become likable (comfortable in my own skin) and come for as a nice guy?",
    "human": "I don't know you, but I suspect there are a couple things you're overlooking.\n\n1) Odds are you don't have to 'become'  more likeable and friendly. The fact that you're feeling like you want to be involved with other people and you feel down when you pass on those opportunities is a phenomenon called 'dissonance'. Dissonance is a fairly well-understood psychological experience occurs when you don't act in accordance with your values. You (probably, stranger :) ) are a nice, friendly person but are fearing rejection, preventing you from acting on what is actually natural for you (joining a conversation). It isn't that you have to become something, it's a question of allowing yourself to behave in a way that is natural for you. \n\n2) Joining a conversation does not come with a set of expectations and rules. You are not instantly exposed to judgement or ridicule simply for leaving your comfort zone (even if it feels that way). There are many great ideas for how to be an effective conversationalist all over the internet, but you won't know if you have skill at this until you go ahead and open up. Remember: you don't actually have to say almost anything to be a part of a conversation. Asking people about their summer plans, asking for car/house/apartment/pet/whatever advice, and (carefully) chatting about office goings-on are easy ways to set a conversation spinning without really requiring all that much maintenance from you.\n\n3) There is no code to crack for being friendly and likeable. People appear that way because we feel a connection to them. Making connections with other people involves, in my limited experience, two main factors - trust and respect. Demonstrating respect involves listening to others, taking them seriously, and showing empathy. Establishing trust really just involves being consistently respectful over time. Take people seriously and don't be afraid to joke around, and you will establish trust and respect.\n\ntl;dr you're probably a good guy already so do what comes naturally, don't put too much pressure on yourself, and get to know people in a way that's comfortable for you.",
    "base_reply": "Becoming more likable and comfortable in your own skin takes time and effort, but it's definitely achievable. Here are some suggestions to help you build your confidence and be your authentic self:\n\n1. **Self-reflection**: Identify the root cause of your self-doubt and fear of being judged. Is it past experiences, low self-esteem, or something else? Once you understand the source, you can work on addressing it.\n2. **Practice self-acceptance**: Embrace your quirks and imperfections. Nobody is perfect, and everyone has things they're not proud of. Focus on your strengths and accomplishments, and learn to accept yourself as you are.\n3. **Develop a growth mindset**: Instead of focusing on what others might think, focus on your personal growth and development. Celebrate your small wins, and don't be too hard on yourself when you make mistakes.\n4. **Improve your communication skills**: Practice active listening, ask open-ended questions, and engage in conversations with genuine interest. This will help you build connections and rapport with others.\n5. **Join a community or group that aligns with your interests**: Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can help you feel more comfortable and accepted. This can be a social club, a volunteer group, or an online community.\n6. **Take small steps**: Start small by taking tiny risks, like striking up a conversation with a coworker or joining a group chat. Gradually increase your level of involvement as you become more comfortable.\n7. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Be gentle with yourself, and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes.\n8. **Focus on others**: Instead of worrying about what others think of you, focus on being a good listener and showing genuine interest in others. This will help you build connections and establish a positive reputation.\n9. **Learn to reframe negative thoughts**: Challenge negative self-talk by reframing your thoughts in a positive light. Instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" try \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough.\"\n10. **Be patient**: Building confidence and likability takes time. Don't expect overnight changes, and be gentle with yourself as you work on your personal growth.\n\nRegarding your specific situation, try to reframe your thinking around joining conversations at work. Instead of worrying about being judged, focus on the value you can bring to the conversation. Remember that everyone has their own struggles and fears, and most people are more focused on themselves than judging you.\n\nRemember, being likable and comfortable in your own skin is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

    "sentence": "For context we have been together for 4 years, married for almost 1 year. Very shortly after our marriage I’ve been having feelings that I really don’t like, like the fact that everything he does seems to annoy me almost every day. I’m very easily irritated by him. I have good and bad days with this, some days his humor and goofiness and constant affection is endearing and most other days I find it aggravating and wish I could just go into another room and lock myself in for the night. \n\nSee me and him are already different in some ways, we still enjoy a lot of the same things, we like to go out and do similar things, we love to play video games together, he also has 2 beautiful kids that we get to put our attention on when they visit every other weekend. But we clash because I’m a person who craves alone time and I like to be by myself a lot, but he’s the opposite and craves affection and attention every minute of every day. \n\nWe have fought so many times over this issue, even after I’ve compromised more and more I finally gave up because every time I’d ask to have a night to myself or just go play video games in the other room for a couple hours he would take that as rejection and I don’t love him anymore so it would become a big argument. So our routine for about a year now has been he leaves for work and I leave for school at the same time, we come home roughly at the same time, we eat dinner together, and spend the rest of the night in the bedroom together either watching TV or playing video games and I feel like I get no time to relax by myself for fear of upsetting him. \n\nHis drinking is also a big issue for me even though episodes of him getting drunk and angry only happen 1-2x a month. A fight that we had several months back while he was drunk is when my feelings first started to dissipate. It was because he wanted to have sex and I said no because I feel weird sleeping with him when he’s sloppy and I’m more sober, so he took that as rejection and got really pissed. After that fight every argument we have now I have no interest in fixing it or talking it out, I just tell him whatever I’m over it let’s just go about life as normal.\n\nI also feel that maybe I feel this way because I’ve never been on my own before. Him and I got engaged and I moved out of my parents house and in with him, that’s the biggest thing I think about is moving out and into my own apartment, I get excited about the thought of living by myself. But now even if I wanted to leave him and move out I can’t because I’m in the middle of doing nursing school full time and have no job. \n\nI don’t want to leave him. We clash on things and he has his own set of issues but he has only had the best intentions with me. This man has worshipped the ground I walk on ever since I met him and still does to this day. He’s constantly physically affectionate and wanting to spend every waking moment with me and I just feel so guilty that I don’t feel the same anymore and all I want to do is be alone. I hate that I feel smothered by him by it he can never get enough of me. I don’t know how to tell him any of this without breaking his heart so I’ve just been going about life as normal and keeping everything inside.\n\nTL;DR: husband is very affectionate and craves quality time, I crave solitude. This didn’t use to bother me until about a year ago now I feel smothered and don’t know how to tell him I feel like im losing feelings without breaking his heart. I don’t want to leave him, I want to know why I don’t feel the same about him anymore.",
    "human": "&gt;even though episodes of him getting drunk and angry only happen 1-2x a month\n\nThis isn't normal. You need to de-normalize this. You're absolutely in the right to find this off-putting and even unacceptable. Getting drunk isn't an excuse to be angry and lash out. He sounds like he has a lot of internal issues from his clinginess to anger. Is he open to therapy?",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings, and I'm here to listen and offer some guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel like you're losing your connection with your husband. The fact that you're craving solitude and feeling smothered is a significant change from your initial feelings towards him, and it's natural to want to understand why this is happening.\n\nIt's great that you're aware of your husband's intentions and that he's been good to you. However, it's also important to recognize that your needs and desires are different from his, and that's okay. It's not about being selfish; it's about being honest with yourself and your partner about what you need to feel fulfilled and happy.\n\nI want to encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings. I know it's scary to hurt him, but ignoring your feelings won't make them go away. It's better to be honest and work through this together than to continue feeling unfulfilled and resentful.\n\nBefore you talk to your husband, take some time to reflect on what you want and need. What are your non-negotiables? What are your boundaries? What makes you feel happy and fulfilled? This will help you communicate your feelings more effectively and assertively.\n\nWhen you do talk to your husband, try to use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed when you're always physically affectionate, and I need some space to recharge\" instead of \"You're always smothering me and it's annoying.\" This can help him understand your perspective and feel less defensive.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge that your husband's drinking is a significant issue, and you may want to consider seeking couples therapy to work through this together. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and develop strategies to manage his drinking and its impact on your relationship.\n\nLastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs. You're not being selfish for wanting to move out and live on your own; it's a normal part of growth and self-discovery. You can explore this option while still maintaining a relationship with your husband, and who knows, it might even bring you closer together.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and communication. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and it's okay to prioritize yourself."

Growing up, my family was always super hard on me, especially because I didn't fit the mold that the rest of the family did, in that I was book smart, and didn't want to work with my hands for the rest of my life, not that there's anything wrong with that. Ever since, I never really ever got any validation from people that I was anything more than \"a nice guy, I guess\".

Seek out friends, mentors, or online communities that uplift and support you.

Focus on learning and improvement, rather than being perfect.\n6. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Regular exercise, meditation, and mindfulness can help boost your mood and confidence.\n7. **Challenge negative self-talk**: When negative thoughts arise, challenge them by reframing them in a positive light. Replace \"I'm not good enough\" with \"I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of.\"\n8. **Develop a personal brand**: Create a personal brand that reflects your values, passions, and strengths. This could be through a blog, social media, or other creative outlets. Sharing your thoughts and experiences can help you build confidence and connect with like-minded individuals.\n9. **Seek professional help**: If you're struggling with persistent low self-esteem or depression, consider seeking help from a mental health professional.

Overpaying employees is a serious issue that can lead to financial and legal problems for both the employer and the employee.\n\nThat being said, since you're willing to return the overpayment if necessary, I'll offer some advice on how to approach this situation:\n\n1. Acknowledge the mistake: If your employer contacts you, own up to the mistake and apologize for the confusion. Explain the situation and offer to rectify the issue.\n2. Document everything: Keep a record of the corrected hours, including the original 36 hours worked and the additional 34 hours and 2 holiday hours that were mistakenly added. This will help you prove the error.\n3. Offer to correct the issue: Suggest that your employer correct the payroll error and adjust your payment accordingly. This shows that you're willing to cooperate and resolve the issue.\n4. Consider a compromise: If your employer is unwilling to correct the issue, consider offering to return the overpayment in installments or as a one-time payment. This demonstrates your commitment to fairness and can help maintain a positive relationship.\n5. Seek HR or management assistance: If the issue persists, seek help from HR or a supervisor. They can assist in resolving the matter and ensuring that the correct payment is made.\n\nRemember, honesty is always the best policy. While it may be tempting to keep the overpayment, it's essential to prioritize integrity and maintain a positive relationship with your employer.\n\nAs for your financial struggles, I understand that it can be challenging. Consider exploring other financial assistance options, such as:\n\n* Budgeting and expense tracking to identify areas where you can cut back\n* Applying for financial assistance programs or government benefits\n* Seeking professional financial advice or counseling\n* Building an emergency fund to avoid future financial stress\n\nRemember, honesty and integrity are essential in your personal and professional life.

This could be a file cabinet, a fireproof safe, or a secure online storage service. Make sure it's easily accessible and protected from damage or loss.\n3. **Use a Consistent Naming Convention**: Develop a system for naming your files and folders. This will help you quickly locate specific documents when needed. For example, you could use a combination of the category, date, and document type (e.g., \"2022-01-Insurance-Declaration.pdf\").\n4. **Digitalize and Scan**: Scan your physical documents and store them digitally. This will help you declutter your physical space and reduce the risk of loss or damage. Consider using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.\n5. **Shred Unnecessary Documents**: Be ruthless – shred or recycle any documents that are no longer necessary or relevant. This will help you avoid clutter and reduce the risk of identity theft.\n6. **Regularly Review and Update**: Set reminders to review and update your documents regularly (e.g., every 6-12 months). This will help you stay on top of expiring documents, such as insurance policies or driver's licenses.\n7. **Consider a Document Organizer**: If you're struggling to keep your documents organized, consider investing in a document organizer or a file management system. These tools can help you stay organized and make it easier to find specific documents when needed.\n\nRemember, organizing your important documents is an ongoing process.

A girlfriend is not equal to a wife to them.\n\nGirlfriends are considered playthings almost, for sex, as status symbol in society/among friend circles, and honestly just for trial runs. They also use women for emotional labour. I have found this true in many cases including among my friend groups.\n\nA girlfriend is what you have as a young boy and then a wife is who bears you children and cooks you home cooked meals like his mother did for him.\n\nIndian men often do not automatically presume that a relationship will naturally progress into a marriage.\n\nIt is up to the women to step up and take stock of the red flags that a man is not going to take responsibility and accountability as a partner in their relationship.\n\nYour ex made it abundantly clear that he was not able to see a future with you.

Stop dating for a bit, stop looking for a partner, avoid doing things that make your feel lonely so you don't get tempted to look for a partner immediately.

You will be less likely to settle for less than what you deserve, if you aren't in a hurry.\n\n2. Focus on your career, ensure that you are financially secure, and will never have to 100% rely on anyone, especially your partner. This is because people can often be unreliable, and temporary. Your resources should never be temporary, you should be able to sustain yourself (if you aren't already)\n\n3. Pay attention to your health, stay fit and remain attractive. This is so that in case you arem't able to find a partner soon, you won't pity yourself and think it's because you're unattractive or undesirable.

In my case, I honestly can't tell if he's just playfully teasing me and I've lost my sense of humor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend Neil has been my buddy for nearly 10 years. We met through work back then (both in different jobs now) and just got along well. We were both married.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe got divorced first. I was always very supportive of him and was a shoulder to cry on when he was fighting for custody of his kids etc. He went on several dates with others since then over the years and would tell me about them, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband had a one-night stand a couple of years ago and that started to unravel my marriage. I moved out briefly (and Neil was part of my support system and helped me a lot when I was at a very low point). I eventually moved back in with my husband but it just wasn't working out and in September we decided to separate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where is becomes confusing: Neil told me my husband was never good enough for me and said he could look after me and he'd treat me so much better. I said I wasn't looking to date anyone right now (but I didn't specifically say \"no\"...but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I am not all that attracted to him even though I cherish him as a good friend). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe kept making jokes about \"when we get together\". Often just silly things like \"we'll adopt 3 dogs and I can't wait for our family Christmas cards\", or \"we can do a couple's Halloween costume...you can be cat woman and I'll be Batman...I can't wait to see you in that latex suit\".  Obviously these are jokes. Some of them were more realistic: \"when we are together, I just want to lay in bed with you all day...we can order in takeaway so we don't have to leave\".  Again, nothing wrong with it, but for some reason it just gives me the ick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started feeling like I am somehow leading him on (and the truth is...I feel ZERO romantic feelings for him, and even if I were potentially interested, my heart is currently broken due to my marriage crumbling and I would not be interested in anyone right now).

When I tell him that no, I'm not pushing down any feelings for him...I just don't have those feelings at all...he seems to get slightly \"pouty\" and quiet for a few days. Then he goes back to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis latest time, he was kidding around about us being together and it was a particularly hard day for me (really missing my husband near Christmas). We are supposed to go on a cruise, just as friends, each paying our own way, for New Year's. I was trying to concentrate on some logistics and he kept asking me silly questions about what type of swimwear I was bringing and if I want him to get a matching speedo and that he can't wait to put sunscreen on each other. I am not a humorless stick-in-the-mud, and I \"lol'd\" at a few comments just to move past it and get on with important things, but it started becoming distracting and annoying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him I don't really feel like that type of banter, that I'm not interested in all these silly fantasies. We aren't together, I don't care what swimwear he chooses, let's concentrate on the topic at hand...that kind of thing. He told me I act less fun than I used to (I guess in the past I never really straight-out told him to cut it out) and that I take everything so literally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I apologized. And within an hour he was back at it. The exact same type of thing. So now I truly have no idea: is this tongue in cheek? Is he teasing me because I'm getting all bent out of shape over silly banter? Is it good natured ribbing? Or is it being disrespectful and purposely ignoring my boundaries because he's irritated that I'm not playing along? I'm so confused by this behaviour, but I truly don't want to lose him as a friend. If it is just good natured teasing I can ignore it, but instead I'm finding myself always questioning everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: is my friend just telling me to chill out and stop taking everything so seriously, or is he purposely pushing my boundaries?",

This could be because he genuinely had romantic feelings for you, even if he hasn't explicitly expressed them.\n\nThe way he's responding to your attempts to set boundaries, such as telling you to \"chill out\" and that you're taking things too seriously, could be a sign that he's not fully acknowledging and respecting your feelings. It's possible that he's not used to being rejected or having his advances rebuffed, and he's struggling to cope with the reality.\n\nIn this situation, I would suggest having a more direct conversation with Neil about your concerns. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey Neil, I wanted to talk to you about our recent interactions. I feel like you've been making some jokes and teasing me a lot lately, and while I appreciate the humor, it's starting to feel like you're not respecting my boundaries. I've told you multiple times that I don't view you romantically, and I'd appreciate it if we could focus on our friendship rather than these fantasies. Can we find a way to connect on a more platonic level?\"\n\nThis conversation might help clarify Neil's intentions and give him a chance to understand your perspective. If he's truly a good friend, he should be able to respect your boundaries and adapt his behavior accordingly.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and well-being in this situation. You don't have to tolerate behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsure. Take care of yourself and focus on nurturing your friendship with Neil in a way that feels authentic and respectful for both of you."

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking proactive steps towards improving your health! Those are great habits you've already established, by the way.\n\nAs for me, I've found a few small habits that have made a significant impact on my overall well-being. One thing I do is prioritize morning sunlight exposure. I make sure to get outside for at least 10-15 minutes in the morning, even if it's just sitting on a balcony or taking a short walk. Natural light has been shown to regulate our circadian rhythms, boost vitamin D levels, and even improve mood.\n\nAnother habit I've developed is a daily \"brain dump\" journaling practice. I dedicate 10-15 minutes each morning to writing down my thoughts, worries, and to-do lists. This helps clear my mind, reduces mental clutter, and allows me to approach the day with a clearer head.\n\nI also make it a point to practice \"micro-movements\" throughout the day. These are small, subtle exercises that can be done while sitting at my desk or during breaks. For example, I'll do some gentle shoulder rolls, wrist extensions, or even just wiggle my toes. It's amazing how these tiny movements can help reduce tension and increase energy.\n\nAnother underrated habit I've found helpful is incorporating \"digital detox\" moments. I'll set aside 30-minute blocks of time each day where I avoid screens and focus on a different activity, like reading, drawing, or simply people-watching. This helps me recharge and reduces the constant distractions that come with being glued to my phone or computer.\n\nLastly, I've started incorporating more \"mindful eating\" practices. I try to savor each bite, pay attention to the flavors, textures, and aromas, and eat slowly. This has helped me develop a healthier relationship with food and reduced my tendency to overeat or mindlessly snack.\n\nThese habits might not be revolutionary, but they've made a significant impact on my overall well-being. I'm curious to hear about any other small habits you've developed or would like to try!"

I went to University too, if you want some advice...''\n\nOur relationship has only been platonic so far. She was going to divorce her husband and she'd already made up her mind months ago,  but some things happened, she still wasn't too sure and  she took her time to divorce him, she divorced him two weeks ago.

No texts received yet and maybe she'll forget again. I'm honestly a little disappointed, she always acts like she cares, but then she forgets to wish me happy birthday or Merry Christmas.

For example, \"Hey, we're happy to see you, but we're trying to keep our schedules pretty busy lately. Would you mind if we limited your visit to a specific day or time?\" This sets the expectation and gives them a clear idea of what to expect.\n2. **Establish a routine**: Consider setting a regular visit schedule, like every 6-8 weeks, to maintain a sense of consistency without overwhelming you. This way, they know when to expect to visit and you can plan accordingly.\n3. **Keep the visits short and sweet**: If they do come to visit, try to keep the visit short and sweet. You can suggest a specific activity or outing, like grabbing coffee or going for a walk, to limit the duration.\n4. **Don't overcommit**: Be mindful of your own energy levels and avoid overcommitting to activities or meals. You can politely decline or suggest alternatives, like \"We'd love to catch up, but we're actually planning a quiet night in tonight. How about we grab coffee another time?\"\n5. **Show appreciation**: Make an effort to show your appreciation for their visits, even if they're not always convenient. You can express gratitude for their company, share a meal or activity, or offer a small gift to show your appreciation.\n6. **Set clear expectations with your family**: Make sure your family members are on the same page and understand your boundaries. This will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone is comfortable with the arrangement.\n7. **Consider a compromise**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider suggesting a compromise, like a phone or video call instead of an in-person visit. This can help maintain the relationship without putting too much pressure on you.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries that work for you. By communicating your needs and being respectful, you can maintain a positive relationship with your relatives while also protecting your own energy and sanity."

This will help him feel seen and appreciated.\n3. **Spend quality time together**: Plan activities you both enjoy, like playing a game, watching a movie, or going for a walk. Make an effort to spend quality time together regularly, even if it's just 30 minutes a week.\n4. **Be present**: Put away your phone and other distractions when spending time with your brother. Being fully present helps him feel like you're giving him your undivided attention.\n5. **Offer help when needed**: If your brother is struggling with a task or project, offer to help him out. This doesn't mean doing it for him, but rather being a supportive guide. This will help him feel capable and confident.\n6. **Celebrate his successes**: Acknowledge and celebrate your brother's achievements, no matter how small they may seem. This will help him feel proud and appreciated.\n7. **Be patient and understanding**: Siblings can be tough to deal with at times. Be patient and understanding when your brother is going through a tough time or making mistakes.\n8. **Show physical affection**: Physical touch can release oxytocin, the \"love hormone,\" which strengthens bonding. Give your brother a hug, high-five, or fist bump to show your affection.\n9. **Respect his boundaries**: Respect your brother's personal space and boundaries. Don't push him to talk about something he's not comfortable discussing or try to control his actions.\n10. **Consistency is key**: Make an effort to consistently show your brother that you care. It's not about grand gestures, but small, everyday actions that demonstrate your concern for his well-being.\n\nRemember, building a strong relationship with your brother takes time and effort. Focus on being present, genuine, and supportive, and he'll be more likely to feel like he can count on you.\n\nAs you start implementing these tips, keep in mind that your brother may not always respond positively or immediately. Be patient, and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. With time and consistency, your efforts will pay off, and your brother will grow up knowing that you care deeply about him."

But the majority of the time my family are watching TV or staring at phones.

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It can be really frustrating and disappointing when you're looking forward to spending quality time with family, but it feels like you're not getting that.\n\nFirstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that you can't control how others choose to spend their time. However, you can control how you respond to the situation.\n\nSince you've already tried asking them to engage in other activities, it's clear that they're not interested. Instead of getting frustrated, try to focus on what you can do to make the most of your time with them. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Set boundaries: It's okay to say, \"Hey, I understand you want to watch TV/scroll through your phone, but I'm going to take some time to [insert your own activity here, like reading a book, taking a walk, or doing a puzzle]. Can I join you later?\" This way, you're respecting their choice while also taking care of yourself.\n2. Plan ahead: Consider bringing a book, journal, or other quiet activity that you can do while still being present in the same room as your family. This way, you can still spend time together while also doing something that brings you joy.\n3. Suggest a compromise: If you really want to spend quality time with your family, try suggesting a compromise. For example, \"Hey, let's take a break from screens and play a game/movie together for a bit, and then you can go back to your TV/phone afterwards.\" This way, you're finding a middle ground that works for everyone.\n4. Re-evaluate your expectations: It's possible that your family's behavior is a reflection of their own priorities and habits. If you're consistently feeling frustrated and unfulfilled during these visits, it might be time to reassess why you're putting so much effort into these trips. Are there other ways you can connect with your family that don't involve traveling so far? Are there other ways you can prioritize your own needs and well-being?\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. By setting boundaries, planning ahead, suggesting compromises, and re-evaluating your expectations, you can find ways to make the most of your time with your family while also taking care of yourself.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add or talk about?"

    "sentence": "I (F27) dated my ex (M32) for around three and a half years. It was a nice, healthy, loving relationship. I broke up with him at the start of 2021 - the reasons for my decision are complicated, but it was never because I thought he was a bad person or bad boyfriend. He took the breakup really hard and tbh I struggled a lot with it too initially because I still really loved him, I just knew we weren't a good match anymore. The first few months after the breakup involved a lot of \"backsliding\" and sleeping together whenever we saw each other, which was quite frequently since we have a lot of mutual friends. Eventually we had a big chat and we both agreed that we wanted to stay in each other's lives as friends, so we needed to stop complicating matters by having sex and move on for good. From that point on we practiced restraint and stopped hooking up, and things were purely platonic. When he started dating again I was just happy to see him happy. About four months ago he started seeing one woman (F30\\~) exclusively. I'll admit that when I first heard he had a new girlfriend I cried lol, it was my initial gut reaction, but I quickly came to accept that this was inevitable and decided to be happy for them. I started seeing them around in social situations, and she was always really friendly and lovely to me, which I appreciated and of course showed back to her.\n\nA couple weeks ago she suggested that I go on a double date with her, my ex and a new guy I had just started seeing (who I'm not seeing anymore). I reluctantly agreed and found the whole experience weird. My ex's new girlfriend spent the whole time making relentless comments about my body, how good I looked in my dress, how she couldn't stop looking at my lips, etc. It was so inappropriate and weird, and I figured she was either trying to test my ex or was just making fun of me. Either way, the night left me feeling really awkward and uncomfortable, so I phoned my ex to discuss it. I broached my theory with him (that she was maybe either making fun of me or was trying to test him to see if he'd agree with the comment she was making about me) and he said it was neither; apparently his new girlfriend is very attracted to me, and has been saying that she wants us all to have a threesome together.\n\nI'm also bisexual, and a threesome was something my ex and I had discussed in the abstract while we were dating, since I had had a few in the past (always as someone's third, never as part of any relationship I've been in) and my ex had never had one, but we both agreed that we were too jealous and monogamous to want to do it. Apparently he and his new girlfriend have had a few threesomes already, so this is a dynamic they're used to, and she has been adamant that she wants one with me. I asked my ex how he felt about the idea; he said his initial gut reaction to the suggestion was \"yes please\" but the rational part of him said it would be too weird and that he figured I would never want to do it anyway. The way he was speaking, it was like he wanted to make it clear that he would never ask this of me, but the more we spoke the more obvious it was that this was something he really wanted. I told him I would think about it and get back to them. Since then his girlfriend has been flirting with me over text.\n\nReasons I am tempted to say yes:- I find both of them attractive- When I was with my ex, part of me was always curious about having a threesome with him. I could just never do it at the time because I was too in love and monogamous. This is my chance to have that experience without having to worry about feeling jealous or possessive etc about seeing him with another woman.- The idea has been turning me on the more I consider it, and I now have a full fantasy of this.\n\nReasons I am hesitant:- Has the potential to be extremely awkward and weird- Backsliding was a pattern for my ex and I, and always led to mixed feelings. I don't want things to be complicated anymore.- \"Threesome with an ex\" just sounds like a textbook Bad Idea, doesn't it?\n\nAny advice to give me please?\n\nTL;DR My ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have asked me if I could join them in a threesome and I'm seriously considering it against my better judgement because I'm horny\n\nEDIT: A few people have asked about the reason for the breakup; I originally wrote a paragraph about it in my original post, but it was becoming too long-winded for an already long-enough post so I scrapped it. It's pretty complicated, but essentially: in the last few months of our relationship, his mental health was on the decline. He has a very  stressful job and he doesn't always handle that stress well, but it was becoming unbearable to deal with. He was lashing out at people,  including me, sabotaging professional opportunities and relationships then beating himself up over it. I really tried to be there for him and help. Every suggestion I made was ignored or turned around on me. I tried (VERY delicately) to tell him I thought he might have depression and anxiety, and that talking to a therapist could help him learn some good coping techniques that could help him handle his stress and  anxiety. He took great offense to that, said I was calling him crazy, that he didn't need to talk to anyone because he wasn't a nutter. These comments really hurt me. I've been in therapy on and off for almost a decade, since I was in an abusive relationship in my late teens and  started therapy shortly after I eventually left that relationship, where I was eventually diagnosed with PTSD. My boyfriend was the first person I confided in about any of this, and he was always so supportive and  encouraging and patient. Whenever I felt like my fears from my past  relationship were getting in the way of what we had, or if I suspected I was beginning to self-sabotage due to those fears, I would go back into  therapy and work on it. He always seemed so understanding of this, and  would tell me how proud he was of me when I would take those steps, so  to hear him now basically say \"I don't need therapy because that's for crazy people\" devastated me. It betrayed who I thought he was, and what I thought his understanding of mental health was. Even when he apologised it was too late, I was becoming resentful that he wasn't taking the steps to look after himself, if not for my sake than for his! And it was just hurting me too much seeing this cycle perpetuate once he made it clear he didn't want to do anything to stop it. It boiled down to \"I love you  but I can't help you until you help yourself\".",

    "base_reply": "Wow, you've got a lot on your plate! I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and weigh the pros and cons. \n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you're tempted by the idea of a threesome with your ex and his new girlfriend. It's natural to be curious about exploring your sexuality and desires, especially when there's a strong emotional connection involved. However, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of getting involved in this situation.\n\nYou've already mentioned the potential awkwardness and weirdness that could arise from this arrangement. Additionally, you've had a history of \"backsliding\" with your ex, which might lead to mixed feelings and complicated emotions. It's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being and avoid getting entangled in a situation that could lead to more heartache.\n\nIt's also important to consider the motivations behind your ex's girlfriend's behavior. While she might genuinely be attracted to you, her relentless comments about your body could be a way to test your ex's boundaries or even manipulate him into doing something he might not be comfortable with. You deserve better than to be objectified or used as a pawn in someone else's game.\n\nRegarding your own desires and fantasies, it's essential to acknowledge that they're valid and natural. However, it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being over the thrill of exploring a new experience. Remember that your happiness and fulfillment are more important than any fleeting pleasure or excitement.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise you to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. Consider what you want for yourself, and whether getting involved in this situation aligns with your values and goals. It might be helpful to have an honest conversation with your ex about your concerns and boundaries, and see if there's a way to maintain a healthy, platonic relationship with him and his girlfriend.\n\nRemember, your worth and value come from within. Don't compromise your emotional well-being for the sake of a thrilling experience. You deserve to prioritize your own happiness and find fulfillment in a way that's authentic and respectful to yourself."

But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to build meaningful relationships without relying on those activities.\n\nFirst, let's focus on finding common ground with your batch mates. Instead of trying to force yourself into a party atmosphere, try to find smaller, more low-key settings where you can have deeper conversations. You could:\n\n1. Join a study group or club related to a topic you're passionate about. This way, you'll be surrounded by people who share your interests, and you can bond over discussions and projects.\n2. Attend networking events or seminars related to your field of study. These events often have a more professional atmosphere, and you can strike up conversations with like-minded individuals.\n3. Volunteer for group projects or case studies. This way, you'll be working together towards a common goal, which can foster a sense of camaraderie and trust.\n\nTo take it a step further, consider reaching out to people individually and asking them about their interests or hobbies outside of class. You might be surprised to find common ground or shared passions that can be a great starting point for a deeper connection.\n\nRemember, building relationships takes time and effort, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on being genuine, respectful, and genuinely interested in others, and you'll be more likely to form meaningful connections.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to be yourself and express your boundaries. If someone pressures you to drink or smoke, it's okay to politely decline and explain your reasons. You don't owe anyone an explanation, but being open and honest can help set the tone for a healthier, more respectful dynamic.\n\nYou got this!"

However, it's crucial to approach the situation with sensitivity and respect, as you're dealing with a family member.\n\nBefore taking any drastic measures, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Document the items: Make a thorough inventory of the items left behind, including photos, descriptions, and their condition.

Send a polite notice: Write a clear, concise, and respectful letter to your grandchild, explaining the situation and giving her a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 30 days) to collect the items. You can mention that you're willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n3. Consider mediation: If your grandchild is unwilling to respond or collect the items, consider seeking the help of a mediator, such as a family therapist or a neutral third-party mediator. This can help facilitate a constructive conversation and find a resolution.\n4. Consult with a local charity or thrift store: If your grandchild is unwilling to collect the items, consider donating them to a local charity or thrift store. This can help declutter your home and support a good cause.\n5. Dispose of items with no sentimental value: If the items are of little to no sentimental value, consider disposing of them responsibly. You can also consider holding a garage sale, selling items online, or recycling them.\n\nRegarding your idea of hiring a lawyer, it might be more cost-effective to explore alternative options before taking legal action. However, if you do decide to seek legal advice, you can consult with an attorney who specializes in family law to discuss your options.\n\nIn summary, take a calm and measured approach to handle the situation. Document the items, send a polite notice, and consider mediation or charity donations. If all else fails, consult with a lawyer to explore your legal options."

She had a fairly valid excuse, but her words and negativity were over the top and just got to me. I later told my other coworker, we'll call her Jane, that maybe I would like my job more if people weren't so negative all the time. (I do like my job, but it is mentally and physically draining and people get burnt out fast.) I casually mentioned to Jane that we should make a pact to just be positive on the days we work together, even if it comes out in the form of sarcasm (for example, saying \"I am the definition of brilliant\" instead of \"Ugh, I'm such an idiot.\") She agreed to this and even mentioned it the next day (in the form of a [meme](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9IBiH5J8PV/?epik=dj0yJnU9UDFIX2RxQWcycU5IbmlvbS1fczlNSHRVYlRzblM5MFQmcD0wJm49UTdWVHRQSXkzeFZPSm50Zjl2WTB0ZyZ0PUFBQUFBR0ZqM1VB), so idk if that really counts lol), so I really want to do something to enforce the pact and not just let it get forgotten. Jane and I do have a tendency to talk about deep topics like the state of the world right now and HR issues and stuff.

Just between the 2 of us for now, but would love to spread throughout the workplace once we find something that works.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for from you all, but something did just come to mind that I could try. Kinda silly, but I know there are studies that show that scents like vanilla and lavender are calming and relaxing. I can't light a candle, but I'm sure I could figure something out.

This could be as simple as saying a daily affirmation, like \"I'm grateful for this moment\" or \"I'm capable of handling this task.\"\n2. **Find the humor**: As you mentioned, using sarcasm can be a great way to diffuse tension and add humor to a situation.

This can help you stay focused on the positive and create a sense of calm.\n7. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to incorporate these positive habits into your daily routine, so they become second nature.\n\nAs for the crystals and stones, even if you don't believe in their metaphysical properties, the placebo effect can still be beneficial. You could try incorporating them into your daily routine, and see if it helps you feel more relaxed or focused.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find what works for you and Jane. Experiment with different techniques, and see what resonates with you both. And don't be afraid to try new things – it's all about finding what helps you feel more positive and energized!\n\nHow do these suggestions sound?

    "base_reply": "The age-old phenomenon of \"one-uppers\"! Dealing with them can be frustrating, to say the least. Here's a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Don't take the bait**: When someone tries to one-up you, avoid getting defensive or competitive. Instead, acknowledge their comment with a simple \"Oh, that's cool\" or \"Nice one!\" and move on. Don't feel the need to reciprocate or try to outdo them.\n2. **Don't engage**: If you don't feel like engaging in a competition, you can simply change the subject or steer the conversation towards something else. This can be as simple as asking a question about their day or sharing something about yourself.\n3. **Practice empathy**: Try to understand why this person might be behaving this way. Are they insecure or trying to prove something? Showing empathy can help diffuse tension and create a more positive atmosphere.\n4. **Set boundaries**: If someone consistently tries to one-up you, it might be necessary to set some boundaries. You can do this by politely but firmly telling them that you're not interested in comparing or competing. You can say something like, \"I'm not trying to one-up anyone, I just want to have a friendly conversation.\"\n5. **Focus on shared experiences**: Instead of focusing on what you have in common with the one-upper, try to find common ground. Ask them about their interests, hobbies, or passions. This can help shift the focus away from competition and towards connection.\n6. **Model a different behavior**: Show others what it means to be humble and genuine by sharing your own experiences and accomplishments in a humble and authentic way. This can help create a ripple effect and inspire others to do the same.\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. By staying calm, empathetic, and focused on building connections, you can create a more positive and supportive environment."

    "human": "This controlling behavior definitely isn't healthy. When in a relationship you should never have to change the way you look to fit someone else's fetishes or type. Find someone who will love you beyond your appearance and will only ask you to grow as a person rather than try to shape you into someone you're not.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you reached out and shared your concerns. It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable and unsure about your boyfriend's expectations.\n\nFirstly, let's address the elephant in the room - your boyfriend's initial comment about considering you \"Asian\" as fitting his \"type\" might be rooted in a fetishization of a specific racial or ethnic group. It's important to recognize that this type of comment can be problematic, as it reduces an entire continent and its people to a set of physical characteristics or stereotypes.\n\nRegarding his request for you to dress like East Asian models, it's understandable that you feel like you're being asked to conform to a certain aesthetic that isn't tailored to your body type or personal style. It's crucial to remember that fashion is a form of self-expression, and it's essential to prioritize your own comfort and confidence in what you wear.\n\nIt's also important to address the double standard you've noticed. It's unfair to hold you to a higher standard than his previous partners, who wore revealing clothes without issue. This suggests that your boyfriend might be projecting his own insecurities onto you, which can be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nHere's a suggestion: have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. Explain how his comments and expectations make you feel, and ask him to respect your personal style and preferences. It's essential to communicate your boundaries and needs clearly, and it's possible that he might not be aware of the impact his words and actions are having.\n\nRemember, a healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and communication. If your boyfriend is unwilling to listen to your concerns and respect your boundaries, it might be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship that need to be addressed.\n\nLastly, it's essential to remember that you are more than just your physical appearance. You are a unique individual with your own strengths, talents, and qualities. Don't let someone else's expectations dictate how you present yourself to the world. You deserve to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin."

Many people struggle with self-doubt and fear of rejection. It's great that you're aware of your concerns and are taking the time to think about it.\n\nNow, let's break it down. You mentioned that you're worried about people you know making fun of you. It's understandable, given your past experience with the girl who started a YouTube channel in high school.

Just because one person didn't succeed with their YouTube channel doesn't mean you'll face the same outcome.\n\nHere's a thought: what if you could flip the script? Instead of worrying about what others might say, focus on the positive aspects of sharing your content. You mentioned you enjoy doing hauls, makeup, and sharing stories – that's something to be proud of! You're sharing your passions and creativity with others, which can be incredibly empowering.\n\nBefore posting, take a step back and ask yourself: What's the worst that could happen? People might make fun of you? But think about the people who will genuinely appreciate your content and connect with you. You might be surprised by the positive feedback and support you receive.\n\nTo overcome your fear, start small. Begin by posting content that's not too personal or revealing. Share some fun, lighthearted videos that showcase your personality, and see how it goes. You can always adjust your content and tone as you become more comfortable.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not alone in this journey. The internet is vast, and it's unlikely that everyone you know will find and follow your TikTok account. Focus on building a community with like-minded individuals who share your interests, and don't worry too much about what others might think.\n\nYou've got this! Take a deep breath, be kind to yourself, and remember that it's okay to start small. You can always adjust and adapt as you go along.

For instance, ask what they have planned for the weekend; do they like to go boating? fishing? gardening? Just watch [favorite sport] on TV? Play internet games? And then ask leading questions about how they tackle some detail... and just mostly listen. \n\nBecause people love to talk about themselves and their own interests. If you make a point of remembering details -- the name of their wife/child/dog/etc.,  and then a week or month later ask them how \"little Tommy\" is doing or whether the Mrs. got her promotion, you will make a seriously positive impression. And that can matter a lot at work!",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It can be tough to break free from the work-talk cycle, especially when it feels like everyone's default topic. Here are some tips to help you steer conversations towards more personal and interesting subjects:\n\n1. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions about work, ask open-ended questions that encourage storytelling and sharing. For example, \"What was the best thing you did over the weekend?\" or \"What's been on your mind lately?\"\n2. **Find common interests**: Try to find out what the other person is passionate about outside of work. Ask them about their hobbies, favorite books, movies, or TV shows. This can lead to some great conversations!\n3. **Share your own interests**: Don't be afraid to share your own passions and hobbies. This can help spark conversations and give others a chance to learn more about you. For example, \"I've been getting into painting lately, have you ever tried it?\"\n4. **Change the subject**: If someone brings up work, try to politely steer the conversation towards a different topic. You can say something like, \"That's really interesting, but I'd love to hear more about [related topic] instead.\"\n5. **Practice active listening**: Make sure you're fully engaged in the conversation and actively listening to the other person. This will help you stay focused on the conversation and avoid defaulting to work talk.\n6. **Prepare ahead of time**: Think about current events, popular culture, or trending topics that you're interested in and want to discuss. This can give you some conversation starters and help you feel more confident in your ability to steer the conversation.\n7. **Set boundaries**: If someone is persistently trying to steer the conversation back to work, it's okay to politely set a boundary. You can say something like, \"I'm happy to catch up on work stuff another time, but I'd love to focus on [other topic] for now.\"\n\nRemember, it might take some practice to break the habit of talking about work, but with time and effort, you can develop new conversational skills and expand your social circle beyond the office."

It's not selfish to prioritize your own well-being, especially when someone you care about is not willing to meet you halfway or acknowledge your efforts to help.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that you've been enabling his behavior by consistently booking therapy sessions and then dealing with the consequences of his lack of follow-through. While it's admirable you've been trying to support him, it's also important to acknowledge that you can't force someone to get help or change their behavior.\n\nIn this situation, it's not about being the \"bad guy\" if you decide to leave.

You deserve to be with someone who values and respects you, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.\n\nTake care of yourself and consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist who can help you navigate this challenging situation."

Schedule a calm and respectful conversation with your roommate. Choose a good time when you're both relaxed, and you've had a chance to settle in.\n2. Start by acknowledging that you appreciate his openness and honesty about his girlfriend being around, which is a big plus. Then, express your concerns about the surprise and how it's affecting your comfort level in the apartment. Be specific about the noise issue and how it's impacting your daily life.\n3. Use \"I\" statements to describe your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example, \"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with the sudden change and the noise from above is making it hard for me to relax.\" Avoid saying \"You did this\" or \"You should have told me.\"\n4. Listen to his perspective and try to understand his thought process.

Approach the conversation with empathy and an open mind, and I'm sure you'll find a way to make it work.\n\nOh, and one more thing: consider having a written agreement or a roommate contract that outlines expectations and boundaries for future reference. It might seem strict, but it can help prevent similar situations in the future."

Use phrases like \"I'm not sure I understand\" or \"Can you help me clarify...\"\n2. **Avoid direct confrontation**: Instead of saying \"You're wrong,\" try rephrasing to focus on the specific point you disagree with. For example, \"I have a different perspective on this. Have you considered [alternative viewpoint]?\"\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of accusing the other person, express your thoughts and feelings using \"I\" statements. For example, \"I feel concerned when I hear that because it seems to contradict [common knowledge]...\"\n4. **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Avoid personal attacks or criticisms. Stick to the topic at hand and try to find common ground. You can say something like, \"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not convinced about [specific aspect]. Can we explore this further?\"\n5. **Ask open-ended questions**: Encourage the other person to share more information or insights by asking open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" This can help you better understand their perspective and find common ground.\n6. **Seek clarification**: If you're unsure about a specific point, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions. This shows you're interested in understanding their perspective and willing to learn.\n7. **Avoid being confrontational body language**: Make sure your nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, are open and receptive. Avoid crossing your arms, furrowing your brow, or leaning away, as these can give the impression you're closed off or defensive.\n8. **Practice active listening**: Show the other person that you're genuinely interested in what they have to say by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and summarizing their points in your own words.\n9. **Be willing to change your mind**: If you realize you were wrong, admit it and adjust your perspective. This shows you're open to new information and willing to learn.\n10. **Know when to agree to disagree**: Not everyone will see eye-to-eye, and that's okay. If you've discussed the issue thoroughly and still can't find common ground, it's okay to agree to disagree and move on.\n\nRemember, effective communication is key.

I've worked really hard through therapy and a range of other activities to overcome them though, which has mostly been successful. The main problem is that when I was younger I chose the wrong people to hang out with, gave people reasons to walk away from friendships, and was pretty badly bullied and ostracised at school, uni and even in my thirties. This has all lead to me being over 40 without a suite of friends acquired throughout history (I do have a few) and really quite terrified of making new friends - I look back at my past and really struggle not to internalise blame for the string of failed friendships behind me, and I fear the rejection deeply. \n\nSo my request is to find out how people make friends over 40 (I also have a young baby) - some helpful ideas of where to go to do it and some tips about how to get to know people without sending out \"I'm avoidable\" vibes. I also struggle to advance a friendship, like suggesting we have coffee or something so how to behave around that stuff would be helpful too. I always feel like if I suggest someone do something with me they will be cornered into saying yes, so I either make a very casual advance so they have plenty of room to squirm away without directly having to reject me, or just don't make the advance.\n\nThanks in advance!",

There would be a lot of people going through similar experiences with the baby which could give you something to bond over and maybe lead to coffee/lunch or whatever afterwards.\n\nYou could also join a local walking/running/cycling group if you had an interest in this - again shared experience could lead to friendships\n\nGood luck!",

It's amazing that you've worked through your past struggles and are now focusing on nurturing your relationships.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to start small and take things at your own pace.\n\nTo make friends over 40, consider the following ideas:\n\n1. Join a community or group aligned with your interests: Look for book clubs, hiking groups, sports teams, or volunteering opportunities that resonate with your passions. This way, you'll be surrounded by like-minded people who share your interests.\n2. Attend events and gatherings: Search for events in your area, such as concerts, festivals, or networking events. You can also try attending meetups, workshops, or classes that focus on topics you're interested in.\n3. Online communities: Join online forums, social media groups, or online clubs centered around your interests. This can be a great way to connect with people who share your passions and values.\n4. Ask friends to introduce you to their friends: Sometimes, the best way to meet new people is through mutual friends. Don't be afraid to ask your existing friends if they know anyone they think you'd get along with.\n5. Be open and honest: When meeting new people, be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. Share your story, and be vulnerable. This can help build deeper connections and trust.\n\nTo get to know people without sending out \"I'm avoidable\" vibes, try the following:\n\n1. Start with small talk: Begin with light, casual conversations about the event or activity you're attending. Ask questions, and listen actively.\n2. Find common ground: Look for shared interests or experiences that can help you connect with others.\n3. Be genuine and authentic: People can usually tell when you're being insincere. Be yourself, and don't try to impress others.\n4. Take small steps: Don't feel pressured to become best friends with someone overnight. Take things slowly, and focus on building a connection over time.\n\nWhen suggesting activities or getting-to-know-you conversations, try the following:\n\n1. Be specific: Instead of saying \"Hey, let's grab coffee sometime,\" suggest a specific activity, like \"I'm going to the park this weekend, want to join me for a walk?\"\n2. Give options: Offer alternatives, like \"Would you like to grab coffee, go for a hike, or attend a concert with me?\" This way, the other person can choose an activity that suits them.\n3. Be respectful: Remember that people have different schedules and preferences. Don't take it personally if someone declines an invitation.\n4. Follow up: If someone expresses interest in an activity, make sure to follow up and confirm the plans. This shows you're reliable and committed.\n\nLastly, remember that building friendships takes time, and it's okay to start small. Focus on building connections with a few people rather than trying to accumulate a large social circle.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you get started on your journey to building new connections and friendships!"

Now, let's tackle the challenge of starting conversations with people you don't know as well.\n\nWhen it comes to engaging with someone of the opposite sex, it's essential to be respectful and professional. Here are a few tips to help you have a great conversation without coming across as flirty:\n\n1. **Start with a neutral topic**: Avoid topics that might be perceived as too personal or flirty, like relationships or physical appearance. Instead, opt for something more general, like a recent project, a common interest, or a current event.\n2. **Show genuine interest**: People love to talk about themselves, so ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about their work, interests, or experiences. Listen actively and respond thoughtfully.\n3. **Keep it light and casual**: Avoid using overly formal language or trying too hard to be witty. A relaxed, friendly tone is usually the way to go.\n4. **Find common ground**: Look for something you both have in common, whether it's a shared hobby, a favorite TV show, or a common interest. This can be a great conversation starter and help you build a connection.\n5. **Be respectful and professional**: Remember that your goal is to build a professional relationship, not a romantic one.

What's your role in it?\"\n* \"I saw [article/ video/podcast] on [topic]. Have you checked it out?\"\n* \"What do you like to do outside of work?\"\n\nRemember, the key is to be yourself, be respectful, and show genuine interest in getting to know the other person. With practice, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your ability to engage in conversations with people from other departments.\n\nAs for building relationships with people you don't necessarily need to know, it's all about being open-minded and willing to take the first step. You might not click with everyone, but that's okay. Focus on building connections with people who share similar interests or values, and you'll find that conversations flow more naturally.\n\nI hope these tips help you get started!"

It's a common and normal experience.\n\nTo build confidence, I recommend focusing on small, achievable goals and celebrating your successes.

Identify situations where you tend to let your emotions cloud your judgment.

You could encourage her to seek out resources or support to help her develop strategies for managing these tendencies.\n\nAs for how you can support her, it's essential to be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on her to make a decision or find a job quickly. Instead, focus on being a sounding board for her ideas and concerns. Encourage her to take small steps towards exploring different career options, and be willing to help her brainstorm or research potential paths.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize your own well-being and stress management during this time. It's natural to feel overwhelmed, but try to maintain open and honest communication with your fiancée about your feelings and concerns.\n\nRemember, this is a significant life transition for both of you, and it's okay to take things one step at a time."

    "sentence": "How to approach a girl for the first time I've been seeing this girl around school for quite some time now, but I've never actually had the courage to go up and actually speak to her.  Can someone give me some tips on how to go up and talk her?",
    "human": "Talking to her is the easy part, but just talking to her is not why you don't have the courage to do it.\n\nGetting rejected is why - So let's solve that.\n\nFirst, you must know your enemy. Why do you like this girl, and not other girls. She is attractive to you right?\n\nSo lets reverse the roles, what would you do if an fat ugly girl with braces hit on you? You'd turn her down. But what if the girl you're talking about came up and asked you on a date? You'd be thrilled!\n\nIt's the same for her. If you're a guy she is attracted to, she'd be thrilled to talk to you. If not, she'd most likely, politely, reject you.\n\nGetting rejected is a good thing, don't feel bad, she's doing you a favor. It means you're not attractive to her. Just like the ugly girl wasn't attractive to you, so you said 'no thanks' - you can't force attraction on someone, it will never work that way.\n\nIt's important to make sure your intentions (ie. not just friends) are known early, you don't want to become her friend, you want to become her man. Be direct, give her the choice to reject or accept you. Otherwise she will just think you're being nice and want to be friends. You *don't* want this. You want to go on a date, or get rejected asap.\n\nAlso once a girl puts you in the 'non attractive' bucket, it's just not worth your time trying to change her mind. Plenty more fish in the sea.\n\nBut there is good news! First, you can improve your attractiveness in many areas, here are 2 of the easiest:\n\nFirst, Confidence! This is attractive and there is a simple secret to it...practice. The first time you do something you had no confidence. The 100th time it's a walk in the park. So don't hesitate, don't second guess, go, try, laugh if you fail, have a good time. This is attractive!\n\nGo one day and try getting rejected by 10 women in a place you will never see them again. Make it a game. I guarantee you at the end you will be enjoying yourself more than trying to get in their panties, and *that* is when they will be asking for you to get in their panties!\n\nThis is why people are more attractive when they drink. They give no shits - everything is a game.\n\nIf you really want this girl I suggest you practice first on other girls. Girls way below your league. Think of it like this, you will brighten their day, because they never get hit on, and will be thrilled, and you gain some much needed practice, because let's face it, if you had what it takes to ask this girl out, you wouldn't be asking reddit.\n\nSecond, Body! Work out, it's hard and takes discipline, but a nice and healthy body is always attractive.\n\nWork on yourself first, pretend you're the fat ugly girl that tried to hit on YOU, imagine she comes back after a year, with a hot body, no more acne or braces, and not stuttering when she asks you out - suddenly she's attractive to you.\n\nSo that is your goal, turn into that attractive version of you!\n\nAnyone can do it. It just takes work.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Approaching someone new can be nerve-wracking, especially if it's someone you've had a crush on for a while. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build up the courage and confidence to talk to her:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Think about what you want to say and do beforehand. Make a mental or written list of topics you're interested in discussing, like a hobby, a common class, or a recent event. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.\n2. **Choose the right time and place**: Consider the environment and timing. You want to pick a spot where you both feel comfortable and won't be interrupted or distracted. Avoid approaching her in front of a large group or when she's in a rush.\n3. **Start with a friendly greeting**: Begin with a simple \"hello\" or \"hi, how's it going?\" Smile and make eye contact. This sets a positive tone and shows you're approachable.\n4. **Be respectful and genuine**: Remember that she's a person with her own thoughts, feelings, and boundaries. Be yourself, and avoid trying to be someone you're not. Show interest in getting to know her as a person.\n5. **Keep it light and casual**: Don't put too much pressure on the conversation. Start with a light, casual topic and see where it takes you. Avoid asking super deep or personal questions right off the bat.\n6. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what she says and show you're engaged. This will help build a connection and make her feel more comfortable.\n7. **Be prepared to accept \"no\"**: It's okay if she's not interested or not ready to talk. Don't take it personally and respect her boundaries. You can always try again in the future or focus on building a friendship.\n\nSome example conversation starters:\n\n* \"Hey, how was your weekend?\"\n* \"I saw you in [class/event], how's it going?\"\n* \"I love [shared interest], have you tried [related activity]?\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to try to land a date or get her phone number right away. Focus on building a connection and getting to know each other. Good luck!"

It can be daunting, but with some awareness and intentional effort, you can ease into the group and build connections. Here are some tips to help you chime in and avoid potential pitfalls:\n\n**Before the hangout:**\n\n* Ask your new buddy about the group's dynamics, interests, and inside jokes. This will give you a heads-up on what to expect and help you prepare.\n* Don't be afraid to ask questions or clarify any unclear references. It's better to be informed than to try to pretend you're in on a joke you're not.\n\n**During the hangout:**\n\n1. **Start with observations**: Share your thoughts on the environment, the activities, or the conversation topics. This shows you're engaged and interested without trying to insert yourself into an existing conversation.\n2. **Find common ground**: Look for shared interests, hobbies, or experiences that can serve as conversation starters. This can help you connect with individual members of the group.\n3. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what's being discussed and show you're interested by nodding, making eye contact, or asking follow-up questions.\n4. **Don't feel pressured to fit in**: It's okay to not know every joke or reference. Avoid trying to be someone you're not or pretending to be an expert on something you're not familiar with.\n5. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in building relationships. Don't try to be someone you think the group wants you to be.\n\n**Red flags to watch out for:**\n\n1. **Exclusion**: If you notice the group frequently excluding you from conversations or making jokes that don't include you, it may be a sign of a cliquey or toxic dynamic.\n2. **Gossip or negativity**: If the group frequently talks about others behind their backs or focuses on negative topics, it may not be a healthy or positive environment.\n3. **Lack of effort to include you**: If the group doesn't make an effort to involve you in conversations or activities, it may indicate they're not interested in integrating you into their social circle.\n4. **Superior attitude**: If the group comes across as condescending or looks down on others, it may be a sign of an unhealthy dynamic.\n\n**What to do if you encounter red flags:**\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Ask yourself if you want to invest time and energy into a group that doesn't seem to value inclusivity or positivity.\n2. **Communicate openly**: If you feel uncomfortable or excluded, have an open conversation with your new buddy or the group about your concerns. They may not be aware of the dynamics and may be willing to make changes.\n3. **Focus on building relationships with individuals**: Instead of trying to fit into the group as a whole, focus on building connections with individual members who share similar interests or values.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and observe before diving into a new social circle. Prioritize your own comfort and well-being, and don't be afraid to step away if you don't feel like you're a good fit."

    "human": "why don’t you just use your cr",
    "base_reply": "The allure of a sign-up bonus! I'm happy to help you navigate this.\n\nFirst, let's break it down: most credit cards offer a sign-up bonus for new customers who meet certain spending requirements within a specific timeframe. In your case, it's $1,000 in purchases within a certain period, and you want to get that $150 cash back without actually spending the full $1,000.\n\nHere's the thing: credit cards are designed to incentivize spending, so it's unlikely you'll find a way to get the bonus without actually making the required purchases. However, I can offer a few suggestions to help you minimize your spending and maximize your cash back:\n\n1. **Prioritize your spending**: Identify essential expenses you need to make, such as groceries, utilities, or rent. Try to allocate those expenses to your new credit card to get closer to the $1,000 mark.\n2. **Use the 50/30/20 rule**: Allocate 50% of your income towards necessities (housing, utilities, food), 30% towards discretionary spending (entertainment, hobbies), and 20% towards saving and debt repayment. This will help you make intentional spending decisions.\n3. **Consider using cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Rakuten offer cashback on specific purchases. You can use these apps to earn additional cash back on top of your credit card rewards.\n4. **Look for alternative offers**: Research other credit cards or rewards programs that offer similar sign-up bonuses with lower spending requirements. You might find a better deal that aligns with your spending habits.\n5. **Avoid overspending**: Remember, the goal is to get the $150 cash back, not to overspend. Be mindful of your spending and avoid making unnecessary purchases.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your financial goals and avoid overspending. If you're not comfortable making the required purchases, you might want to reconsider applying for the credit card or explore alternative rewards programs.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to make some intentional spending decisions to get that cash back?"

I've gathered some practical tips and hacks from homeless individuals and experts that can benefit both the homeless and the housed:\n\n1. **Pack light and prioritize**: Homeless individuals often have to carry all their belongings with them. Learn to pack light, prioritize essential items, and consider using a backpack or duffel bag with multiple compartments.\n2. **Use public libraries and community resources**: Many libraries offer free access to computers, showers, and laundry facilities. Homeless individuals can use these resources, and housed individuals can take advantage of free Wi-Fi, books, and other services.\n3. **Scout for food and resources**: Homeless individuals often know where to find food banks, soup kitchens, and other resources. You can do the same in your area by searching online or asking locals for tips.\n4. **Take care of your physical and mental health**: Homelessness can take a toll on overall well-being. Prioritize self-care, exercise regularly, and seek professional help if needed. Housed individuals can benefit from these habits as well.\n5. **Develop a \"survival\" mindset**: Homeless individuals often need to think creatively and adapt quickly. Practice problem-solving, and learn to navigate unexpected situations.\n6. **Build relationships and networks**: Homeless individuals often rely on social connections for support. Cultivate strong relationships with others, and don't be afraid to ask for help when needed.\n7. **Use online resources**: Websites like Freecycle, Nextdoor, and local Facebook groups can help you find free or low-cost resources, including clothing, furniture, and services.\n8. **Keep a \"just-in-case\" fund**: Housed individuals can benefit from having a small emergency fund for unexpected expenses. Homeless individuals often rely on cash or bartering, so having some savings can be a lifesaver.\n9. **Stay organized and tidy**: Keeping a clean and organized living space can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. This applies to both the homeless and housed.\n10. **Practice gratitude and resilience**: Homeless individuals often face incredible challenges, but they often maintain a strong sense of hope and resilience. Practice gratitude and focus on the positive aspects of your life, no matter what your situation.\n11. **Learn to navigate bureaucracy**: Homeless individuals often need to navigate complex systems to access services. Develop a strong understanding of your local bureaucracy and be prepared to advocate for yourself or others.\n12. **Find a \"home base\"**: Homeless individuals often need a safe and stable place to rest. For the housed, this might be a cozy home or a favorite coffee shop. Having a \"home base\" can provide a sense of security and comfort.\n\nRemember, these tips are meant to be helpful, not prescriptive. Everyone's situation is unique, and it's essential to approach each individual with empathy and understanding.

Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and focus on your breath, a mantra, or a physical sensation. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the chosen focus. You can use apps like Headspace or Calm to guide you.\n2. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. This will help you stay focused on one task at a time and reduce mental overwhelm.\n3. **Eliminate distractions**: Identify the things that distract you the most (social media, phone notifications, chatty coworkers, etc.) and eliminate them while you work. Use tools like website blockers or apps that help you stay on track.\n4. **Practice active listening and reading**: When reading or listening to information, actively engage with the material. Summarize what you've read or heard in your own words, and ask yourself questions about the content.\n5. **Get enough sleep and exercise**: A well-rested and physically active brain is more capable of focusing. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep and incorporate physical activity into your daily routine.\n6. **Limit multitasking**: Try to focus on a single task at a time. Multitasking can reduce productivity and increase mental fatigue.\n7. **Use music to your advantage**: Instead of letting songs fill your mind, try listening to instrumental music or white noise while you work. This can help you stay focused.\n8. **Practice deep breathing exercises**: When you feel your mind wandering, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your mind and refocus your attention.\n9. **Set realistic goals and deadlines**: Break down large tasks into smaller, achievable goals with deadlines. This will help you stay motivated and focused.\n10. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you complete tasks or reach milestones. This can help motivate you to stay on track.\n\nRemember, developing a clearer mind takes time and practice. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you struggle at first. With consistent effort, you can improve your focus and reduce mental distractions.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of self-compassion. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend who's struggling. You got this!"

This fund will help you avoid going into debt when unexpected expenses arise.\n5. **Develop a healthy relationship with credit**: Use credit responsibly by keeping your credit utilization ratio low (less than 30%) and making on-time payments.

Instead, direct excess funds towards savings, debt repayment, or investments.\n9. **Develop a growth mindset**: Focus on personal growth and development, which can lead to higher earning potential and better financial opportunities.\n10. **Review and adjust regularly**: Regularly review your financial situation, goals, and habits to ensure you're on track to achieve your financial objectives.\n\nRemember, developing good financial habits takes time and discipline, but it's worth it in the long run.

And I’ve been trying to help her more in her day now that it could be tough for her. I assume it’s helping.\n\nOne progress step that I did was talking with her mom about this, and she was very understanding, but she couldn’t really help much but tell me to talk to her, since she didn’t understand because my girlfriend wasn’t cold against her mom, and have never been like that to anyone. Anyway she suggested that I should continue to stand by my girlfriend’s side.\n\nOtherwise, me and my girlfriend had an “intense” moment in the car when I were driving, I had my hand on her thigh, and then we glanced through each other’s eyes for a solid time, no words spoken. It was the first time in a looong time something like that have happened.\n\nAlso I’m really considering couples therapy.\n\n\n\nTo be continued I guess.",
    "human": "What does she say when you ask her about it? \n\nIf it's mostly physical coldness it could be the hormones they can shift wildly.  \n\nTALK TO HER ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL AND YOUR FEARS",
    "base_reply": "I can sense the pain and concern in your words. It's understandable that you're feeling lost and unsure about what to do.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for acknowledging that you've been trying various approaches to bridge the gap, and it's great that you're considering couples therapy. That's a huge step towards addressing the issue.\n\nGiven your girlfriend's cold demeanor, it's likely that she's struggling with her own emotions and feelings, which is understandable, especially during pregnancy. It's possible that she's overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed about the impending parenthood, and her way of coping is to withdraw from emotional intimacy.\n\nIn this situation, it's essential to approach the issue with empathy and understanding. Instead of trying to \"fix\" the problem or change your girlfriend's behavior, focus on being present and supportive. Continue doing the things you've been doing, like helping her with daily tasks and being there for her.\n\nRegarding your concerns about her not reacting to your touch, it's possible that she's not feeling emotionally available due to her current state. This doesn't mean she doesn't love you or value your touch; it might just mean that her emotional energy is directed elsewhere.\n\nThe \"intense\" moment in the car is a promising sign, as it shows that there's still a connection between you two. It might be a small spark, but it's a starting point for rebuilding your emotional connection.\n\nBefore diving into couples therapy, consider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Share your concerns and feelings in a non-accusatory way, using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. For example, \"I feel lonely and disconnected from you lately. I miss the way we used to connect and talk about our feelings. Can we find a way to rebuild that connection?\"\n\nBe prepared to listen to her perspective and feelings, and try to understand what's going on from her side. It's possible that she's struggling with her own emotions and needs support as well.\n\nRemember that this is a challenging time for both of you, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Focus on being present, supportive, and understanding, and try not to put too much pressure on the situation. With time, patience, and effort, you can work together to rebuild your connection and strengthen your relationship."

Here's a suggestion:\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to feel a mix of emotions when reconnecting with old friends, especially if you've been apart for a while. It's natural to wonder what could've been, and it's okay to feel a twinge of regret.\n\nTo avoid awkwardness and regret, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prepare for the encounter**: Think about what you want to talk about, what you're excited to catch up on, and what you're willing to let go of. This will help you stay focused and avoid awkward silences.\n2. **Be present in the moment**: When you're together, focus on the present conversation, rather than dwelling on what could've been. Ask open-ended questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest in your friend's life.\n3. **Don't put too much pressure on the reunion**: Try not to put too much emphasis on the \"what-ifs\" or \"should'ves.\" Instead, focus on the present and the fact that you're reconnecting with someone you care about.\n4. **Communicate openly**: If you do find yourself feeling regretful or nostalgic, it's okay to express those feelings to your friend. However, be mindful of your friend's emotions and boundaries. Avoid dwelling on the past or placing blame.\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Remind yourself that everyone grows and changes, and it's okay if things didn't work out as planned. You did the best you could with the resources you had at the time, and that's something to be proud of.\n6. **Focus on the positive**: Try to find the good in the situation and the friendship. Celebrate the memories you shared, and acknowledge the growth and learning that's occurred since you last saw each other.\n7. **Set realistic expectations**: Don't put too much pressure on the friendship to be exactly like it was in the past. Allow it to evolve and change naturally, just as you have.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be true to yourself and your emotions.

    "sentence": "My partner (39M) and I (38F) have been together for 3 years and living together for 2 in the house he was renting prior to meeting me.  Our landlord has made it clear that he wants to sell the house and that we will need to move by spring/summer.  We both agree that the smartest move would be to purchase a home since rentals that meet our desired criteria are expensive and he is making a decent salary at this point and we would like to own a property.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for this financially is the down payment - neither of us has that kind of savings right now.  His parents have offered to help with the down payment, with a caveat - they do not believe in \"living in sin\" and would not help with the payment knowing we live there together.  Come to find out that his parents don't know that we have been living together at all (I haven't met them, they live out of state and are not close to my partner. He describes them as crazy religious types.)\n\nI am not happy with this.  Buying a house with someone is a relationship goal for me.  My partner says it's more of a housing matter for him.  He has pre-qualified for a loan and wants to move forward with purchasing a house and for me to help pick it out and move in.  His plan is to be the sole title holder and not tell him parents that I'm living there, perhaps eventually adding me to the title.  He says it will be \"our\" house, but legally that will not be true.  My income does not qualify for a large enough loan to finance a house by itself.  I feel really unhappy and insecure with the idea of him being the sole owner while I contribute to his equity and have nothing to show for it, especially knowing our cohabitation is a secret from his parents.  Additionally, our options to buy are limited and we are looking at a fixer, which would require more investment that I may never get back if things don't work out.  I want to build a home together, but I feel like this arrangement isn't fair to me.  On an emotional level I feel like he is moving forward without me. I want to buy a home together, not pretend that we are.  :(\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend wants to purchase a house as the sole title holder - I feel like the arrangement isn't fair and that he is moving forward without me.",

    "base_reply": "I can sense the frustration and disappointment in your words. It's understandable that you feel this way. Let's break down the situation and explore some concerns.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're thinking critically about the financial implications of buying a house. It's essential to consider the long-term consequences of this decision.\n\nRegarding the offer from his parents, it's understandable that you're upset about the condition attached to their help. It's not only unfair but also invasive and judgmental. You should not feel pressured to hide your relationship or compromise your values to accommodate his parents' beliefs.\n\nNow, let's address the issue at hand: the sole title ownership. It's reasonable that you want to be recognized as a joint owner and have a sense of security and equity in the property. His plan to add you to the title later might not be enough, as you're right that it wouldn't change the current situation.\n\nIt's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns. You've already expressed your feelings, but it might be helpful to reiterate them and add some specific examples of how this arrangement makes you feel. For instance, you could say:\n\n\"I understand that you're excited about buying a house, and I am too. However, I feel like this arrangement is unfair because I won't have any legal claim to the property, even though I'll be contributing to the mortgage and other expenses. It feels like you're moving forward without me, and I want to build a home together, not just pretend to. I'm worried that this could create resentment and unease in our relationship. Can we explore other options that would allow us to purchase a house together, with joint ownership and a sense of mutual investment?\"\n\nIt's crucial to listen to your partner's perspective and concerns as well. Ask him to share his thoughts and feelings about this situation. Is there a specific reason he's hesitant to add you to the title initially? Is there a fear of his parents' reaction or something else?\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to consider the bigger picture. Are you both on the same page about your long-term goals and expectations? Are you both comfortable with the idea of buying a fixer-upper and taking on the potential risks and responsibilities that come with it? Are you prepared to have a joint discussion about the financial aspects of homeownership and create a plan for managing expenses and making decisions together?\n\nRemember, buying a house is a significant decision that requires careful consideration and open communication. Take the time to have a thorough conversation with your partner, and don't be afraid to explore alternative options that better align with your values and goals."

Whether its an obvious jump scare on the TV or on a film, or someone dropping something in the office, or a bus' air brakes on the street. Im tired of looking like I'm on edge all the time when I'm actually really chilled!",
    "human": "M",
    "base_reply": "Flinching can be quite frustrating, especially when it's not accompanied by fear. It's great that you're aware of your body's reaction and want to work on changing it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that flinching is a common phenomenon, and it's not unique to you. Many people experience it, even if they don't admit it. It's often linked to our brain's natural response to perceived threats, which can be triggered by sudden, unexpected sounds.\n\nTo start working on reducing your flinching, I recommend a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Awareness**: The first step is to become more aware of your body's reaction. When you flinch, take a deep breath and acknowledge the sensation. Recognize that it's not a big deal and that your body is just reacting to a stimulus.\n2. **Relaxation techniques**: Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation to help calm your nervous system. This can help reduce your overall anxiety and make it easier to manage flinching.\n3. **Desensitization**: Gradually expose yourself to the types of sounds that trigger your flinching. Start with small, manageable steps, like listening to a recording of a loud noise at a low volume and gradually increasing the volume over time. You can also try watching scary movies or TV shows with the sound turned down and the subtitles on, so you're not startled by sudden noises.\n4. **Physical relaxation**: When you feel a flinch coming on, try to relax your physical body. Roll your shoulders, unclench your fists, and release any tension in your face and jaw. This can help your body learn to respond differently to stimuli.\n5. **Mindset shift**: Reframe your thinking around flinching. Instead of seeing it as a weakness or something to be ashamed of, view it as a natural response that you're working to overcome. Focus on your progress, no matter how small, and celebrate small victories.\n6. **Patience**: Changing your body's response takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. It's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to eliminate flinching entirely but to reduce its frequency and intensity. With consistent practice and patience, you can learn to manage your body's response and feel more in control."

We have all had the goal to buy a house and often talked about our plans and listing. The difference is that while we talked, my partner and I put in the work and action. We found a broker and agent, got preapproved for a mortgage and looked at listings/went to viewings almost every day. We put in many offers that got turned down. \n\nWhen we finally had our offer accepted we were ecstatic. The market is absolutely insane right now and houses are selling for 100k - 500k over asking. When we told our mutual friends, they were happy for us, but since then things haven't been the same. \n\nWe don't bring up our house at all - tbh I avoid the topic because I know it could make them uncomfortable. We also make sure we go to their place as often as possible when we hang out. I've just found lately things have gotten more tense. The bitterness is starting to show more and they keep blowing us off when we reach out.\n\n I'm not sure what we can do. I love them both and I would hate for this to ruin the friendship. Is there anything we can say or do?\n\nTL;DR\nMy partner and I bought a house after years of saving and looking for the right place. This has caused tension between our mutual friends who had a similar goal. They are avoiding us and don't want to hang out as much now. Is there anything we can do or say to address this?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much everyone for your responses. It has really helped me to self-reflect. I can understand how my post came off as smug and privileged. I can also understand the privilege in being able to view as many listings as we did. I will admit I probably spent too much time online looking and booking viewings. We just had a really shitty living situation and I wanted to change it so badly.  I will also provide more context below. \n\nBefore when we were all talking about buying a house we briefly spoke about income and savings. They stated they were in a similar position to us. From what they said they actually had more savings than us. When we found our broker and qualified we offered to give them the info to which they declined. Even now we have offered the info and they decline. We also offered our agent who was really helpful. \n\nI found out recently that they had been viewing houses online before they spoke to a broker or had an agent and wanted to put offers in but hesitated because the houses weren't what they wanted. That is completely understandable and I can see where they were coming from. We had originally wanted a detached home, too, but after putting in some offers which were rejected we decided on a condo or row house. \n\nOn to why I suspect there might be jealousy, and it is true this could 100% be projection. I want to emphasize that my partner and I do not bring up the topic, we don't talk about our house. At one point they said that buying a house was a sore topic and we completely respected that. But they would bring up the topic and often get heated about the market or that they can only afford a \"piece of shit.\" Again, perfectly reasonable. The reason we have been trying to go to their house as well is that we have invited them over for a few months now and they always cancel or decline. When we are with them at their place we have a lot of fun! But I notice if I bring up concerns about money it gets brushed off with a \"yeah but you have a house so who cares.\" \n\nIn relation to our house, we bought an old ass house that needed work. It truly is nothing fancy or extravagant, but we love it. We are slowly finishing projects as we go and it can be stressful, but it is worth it. A lot of the houses we went to had obviously been shown a lot (there would be like 30+ business cards) but this one only had one or two. We decided to put in the offer and it worked out for us, but that wasn't without 10+ rejected offers on other homes.",

It's clear that you and your partner have put in a lot of effort and dedication to achieving your goal of buying a house, and it's understandable that your friends might feel a bit left behind or envious.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're aware of the potential jealousy and are trying to address it by avoiding bringing up the topic and making an effort to spend time with your friends at their place. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your friends might be feeling a bit hurt or left out, and that's something you should try to address.\n\nOne thing you could try is to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your feelings and concerns. You could say something like, \"Hey, we've noticed that things have been a bit awkward between us lately, and we want to talk about it. We know that buying a house was a big goal for us, and we're happy to have achieved it. But we also know that it might be a sensitive topic for you guys, and we want to make sure we're not making things awkward. Can we talk about what's going on and how we can work on keeping our friendship strong?\"\n\nIt's also important to listen to your friends' concerns and validate their feelings. They might be feeling left out or envious, and it's okay to acknowledge that. You could say something like, \"We can understand why you might be feeling a bit left out or envious. We know that buying a house is a big milestone, and it's natural to feel that way. But we want you to know that we value our friendship and we're not trying to rub it in anyone's face. We're just happy to have achieved this goal, and we want to share it with you guys.\"\n\nIt's also important to remember that your friends' lack of success in buying a house might not be solely due to your success. There are many factors at play, and it's not fair to assume that they're just jealous of you. Try to avoid making assumptions and focus on having an open and honest conversation.\n\nFinally, it might be helpful to focus on other common interests and hobbies that you and your friends share. This can help shift the focus away from the house and back to your friendship. You could plan a fun activity or outing that doesn't involve talking about real estate, and see if that helps to break the ice and bring you guys back together."

She apologized immediately for the 'jokes' when she saw how much weight I'd lost and was super supportive about me not drinking anymore and coming out of the closet. She is not the problem, at all.\n\nThe problem is our parents. From what my sister said, my mom especially has been steadily alienating everyone in the family. When I left, she found a new target in my little brother. When he joined the military and left, she started going after my cousins. My big sister, the one who's having the wedding, has always been my mom's favorite, but she says that she's opened her eyes to how my mom treats people and is planning to move away herself after the wedding (our parents are paying for most of it).\n\nI've agreed with my sister that I'm not coming to the wedding. We agreed that it would give mom a new target to make a huge scene over, and there will be an open bar at the wedding when I don't trust myself to be around that kind of thing. \n\nWe're now planning for my sister and husband to come visit me in my new city sometime after the wedding. \n\nThank you for all the advice and support!\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: zoom called big sister, she's great, I'm not going to the wedding but my sister will visit later",

It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your sister is planning to visit you in your new city after the wedding. That will give you a chance to spend quality time together and catch up in a more relaxed setting.\n\nOne thing to consider is how you'll handle future interactions with your parents, especially your mom. It sounds like she's been problematic in the past, and it's possible that she may continue to be a source of stress in your life. You may want to think about setting some boundaries or establishing a communication plan that works for you, so that you can maintain a healthy distance and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're taking care of yourself and making thoughtful decisions.

To put it simply, I have no idea how to spend my free time.\n\nTo explain: I am just out of university, working a full time job. What I do with my time is go to work (which I do enjoy), then usually sit at home on the internet, or watching movies or TV. I go to the gym fairly often, and sometimes hang out with friends. That's really all I do, and it feels rubbish. I am ticking a lot of boxes: working hard, saving money, fit, friendly, blah blah. But I don't feel like I ever do anything new, interesting or exciting. \n\nPart of the problem is that I really don't know what to do with free time. If I have a day off work, I will sit there and think of something fun to do, and I come up blank. I cannot think of anything appealing that would occupy that time and enrich my life. It gets to the point where I feel like I'm just finding an excuse to kill time and it becomes a chore. And then I just end up back on reddit again.\n\nDo you guys have any tips for me to get some spice back into my life?",

First, let's acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way, especially after a big life transition like finishing university and starting a full-time job. Now, let's get to some practical tips to help you shake things up!\n\n1. **Reflect on your values and interests**: Take some time to think about what truly matters to you. What activities, hobbies, or causes do you feel passionate about? Make a list of your top values and interests. This will help you identify areas where you can start exploring new experiences.\n2. **Schedule your free time**: Instead of waiting for inspiration to strike, plan out your free time in advance. Set aside specific days or times for activities you enjoy, like gym sessions or hangouts with friends. This will help you create a sense of structure and accountability.\n3. **Try something new**: Challenge yourself to try one new thing each month. It can be as simple as trying a new recipe, taking a cooking class, or joining an online course. The goal is to step out of your comfort zone and discover new passions.\n4. **Explore local opportunities**: Look into local events, meetups, or groups centered around your interests. Attend concerts, festivals, or volunteer opportunities. This will help you meet new people and experience new things.\n5. **Create a'maybe' list**: Write down a list of activities you've always wanted to try but haven't had the chance. This can be anything from skydiving to learning a new language. Review the list regularly and start crossing off items as you tackle them.\n6. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This can include meditation, reading, or simply taking a relaxing bath. Prioritizing self-care will help you feel more balanced and energized.\n7. **Re-evaluate your online habits**: While it's okay to enjoy some internet time, make a conscious effort to limit your screen time and explore other activities. Try journaling, drawing, or playing an instrument to fill the void.\n8. **Create a 'done' list**: Instead of focusing on what you haven't done, make a list of things you've accomplished. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This will help shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life.\n9. **Seek accountability**: Share your goals and aspirations with a trusted friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can provide an added motivation to stay on track.\n10. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to take your time figuring things out. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't immediately find something that excites you. Keep experimenting, and eventually, you'll discover new passions and interests.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to find the right balance. Start with small steps, and be gentle with yourself as you explore new possibilities. Good luck!"

Even 10-15 minutes a day can be beneficial.\n2. **Learn a new skill or hobby**: Pursue something you've always been curious about, like photography, playing an instrument, or cooking.

While it's not always possible to completely conceal one's emotions, there are some strategies to help you manage your facial expressions and appear more composed in critical situations. Here are some lifehacks and tricks to get you started:\n\n1. **Breathe deeply and relax**: Before entering a situation, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This helps slow down your heart rate and calm your nervous system, making it easier to control your facial expressions.\n2. **Relax your facial muscles**: When you're feeling anxious or nervous, your facial muscles tend to tense up. Practice relaxing your facial muscles by doing simple exercises like smiling, then releasing the smile, and repeating this process. You can also try rolling your shoulders, unclenching your jaw, and releasing any physical tension.\n3. **Use positive self-talk**: Replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Instead of thinking \"I'm going to mess this up,\" tell yourself \"I've prepared well, and I can handle this.\" This helps shift your mindset and reduces anxiety.\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, making it easier to recognize when you're starting to show your emotions on your face. Regular mindfulness practice can also reduce overall stress and anxiety.\n5. **Use a \"masking\" expression**: Practice using a neutral or slightly positive facial expression, such as a slight smile or a calm, focused look. This can help distract from any underlying emotions and create a more confident appearance.\n6. **Avoid fidgeting**: Fidgeting can be a giveaway of nervousness. Try to keep your hands still and avoid playing with your hair, jewelry, or other objects.\n7. **Maintain good posture**: Good posture can help you feel more confident and composed. Stand or sit up straight, with your shoulders back and head held high.\n8. **Use visual distractions**: In situations where you're feeling anxious, try to focus on something else, like the conversation, the environment, or the person you're interacting with. This can help shift your attention away from your own emotions.\n9. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice hiding your emotions, the better you'll become at it. Try role-playing different scenarios, such as job interviews or social gatherings, to build your confidence and emotional control.\n10. **Seek professional help**: If you're struggling to manage your emotions and it's affecting your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with personalized guidance and support to help you develop healthy emotional regulation strategies.\n\nRemember, hiding your emotions completely is not always possible or desirable. Authenticity and honesty are often valued traits, and suppressing emotions can lead to burnout and mental health issues. The goal is to develop emotional awareness and regulation skills to navigate challenging situations with confidence and poise."

    "human": "Talking to her is the easy part, but just talking to her is not why you don't have the courage to do it.\n\nGetting rejected is why - So let's solve that.\n\nFirst, you must know your enemy. Why do you like this girl, and not other girls. She is attractive to you right?\n\nSo lets reverse the roles, what would you do if an fat ugly girl with braces hit on you? You'd turn her down. But what if the girl you're talking about came up and asked you on a date? You'd be thrilled!\n\nIt's the same for her. If you're a guy she is attracted to, she'd be thrilled to talk to you. If not, she'd most likely, politely, reject you.\n\nGetting rejected is a good thing, don't feel bad, she's doing you a favor. It means you're not attractive to her. Just like the ugly girl wasn't attractive to you, so you said 'no thanks' - you can't force attraction on someone, it will never work that way.\n\nIt's important to make sure your intentions (ie. not just friends) are known early, you don't want to become her friend, you want to become her man. Be direct, give her the choice to reject or accept you. Otherwise she will just think you're being nice and want to be friends. You *don't* want this. You want to go on a date, or get rejected asap.\n\nAlso once a girl puts you in the 'non attractive' bucket, it's just not worth your time trying to change her mind. Plenty more fish in the sea.\n\nBut there is good news! First, you can improve your attractiveness in many areas, here are 2 of the easiest:\n\nFirst, Confidence! This is attractive and there is a simple secret to it...practice. The first time you do something you had no confidence. The 100th time it's a walk in the park. So don't hesitate, don't second guess, go, try, laugh if you fail, have a good time. This is attractive!\n\nGo one day and try getting rejected by 10 women in a place you will never see them again. Make it a game. I guarantee you at the end you will be enjoying yourself more than trying to get in their panties, and *that* is when they will be asking for you to get in their panties!\n\nThis is why people are more attractive when they drink. They give no shits - everything is a game.\n\nIf you really want this girl I suggest you practice first on other girls. Girls way below your league. Think of it like this, you will brighten their day, because they never get hit on, and will be thrilled, and you gain some much needed practice, because let's face it, if you had what it takes to ask this girl out, you wouldn't be asking reddit.\n\nSecond, Body! Work out, it's hard and takes discipline, but a nice and healthy body is always attractive.\n\nWork on yourself first, pretend you're the fat ugly girl that tried to hit on YOU, imagine she comes back after a year, with a hot body, no more acne or braces, and not stuttering when she asks you out - suddenly she's attractive to you.\n\nSo that is your goal, turn into that attractive version of you!\n\nAnyone can do it. It just takes work.",

Avoid approaching her when she's in a rush or surrounded by a big group of people.\n2. **Be yourself**: Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. Just be authentic and honest. This will help you come across as more relatable and approachable.\n3. **Start with a simple greeting**: Just walk up to her and say hi! You can say something like, \"Hey, how's it going?\" or \"Hi, how was your day?\" Keep it simple and casual.\n4. **Show genuine interest**: Ask her about herself, her interests, or her hobbies. This will help you build a connection and show her that you're interested in getting to know her.\n5. **Keep it light**: Don't put too much pressure on the conversation. Keep it light and casual, and don't try to delve into deep, heavy topics right off the bat.\n6. **Be respectful**: Remember that she's a person with her own thoughts and feelings. Don't be pushy or aggressive, and respect her boundaries if she doesn't seem interested in talking to you.\n\nHere's an example of how you could put these tips together:\n\nYou: \"Hey, how's it going?

What's your favorite class or activity here?\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to try to impress her or get her to fall in love with you right off the bat.

I've started to see my friend including his new friend in some of the activities I've always wanted to do with him. Often times when I ask my friend to be included I feel really shitty afterwards and I feel like I was too pushy. I feel like if my friend doesn't ask first I'm imposing or I'm pushy.

I know we've always been close, and I value our friendship. I'm not sure if it's because of social anxiety or what, but I've been feeling a bit uncertain about how to initiate activities with you lately. I want to make sure you know that I still want to spend time with you and include you in my plans. Can we find a way to make sure we're both comfortable initiating and inviting each other to activities? Maybe we can even set up a regular check-in to catch up and plan things together?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're coming from a place of vulnerability and concern, rather than demanding or entitled. By acknowledging your own feelings and fears, you're giving your friend an opportunity to understand your perspective and work together to find a solution.\n\nAs for your fear that if you don't ask, your friend might think you've lost interest or don't care anymore, I'd say that's a valid concern. However, it's also important to remember that your friend is a human being with their own thoughts and feelings. If they truly value your friendship, they'll likely appreciate your honesty and willingness to work through this together.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and feelings in this situation.

We’ve tried to-do list apps, sticky notes, splitting tasks, etc. Constantly reminding him to do anything makes me feel like a hoverboard parent, but not asking him to do anything means duties fall on me which is exhausting. Garbage and dishes piles up, waste everywhere, clothes everywhere, shoes everywhere, pee on the toilet and floor, filth. I can’t stand it. I’m driven up a wall. I try being nice when asking, including asking how I can help make him remember, instead I get told that “apparently he does nothing” and he’ll bring up 1 chore he did that week. We all know running a house consists of more than one chore, not to mention when there are animals thrown in the mix. I’ve tried not doing his chores.. I’m drowning if that happens. Don’t have time to enjoy myself or life because I’m too busy cleaning or suffering from silent treatment from my boyfriend because he’s upset I asked him again to clean.

    "base_reply": "I can feel the frustration and desperation in your words. It's understandable that you're at your wit's end. Let's break this down and explore some potential solutions.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not being a \"hoverboard parent\" by asking your boyfriend to contribute to household chores. It's a normal and necessary part of adult life, and it's not fair to assume that you should carry the burden alone.\n\nGiven your boyfriend's ADHD, it's likely that he struggles with executive function tasks, which can make it challenging for him to initiate and complete tasks. However, that's not an excuse for not contributing to the household. It's crucial to find a balance between understanding his challenges and setting clear expectations for your shared responsibilities.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend: Instead of focusing on his ADHD, try to have a calm and non-accusatory conversation about the impact his lack of contribution is having on you and your life. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed and exhausted when I'm left to handle all the household chores. I need your help to share the responsibilities.\"\n2. Set clear expectations and boundaries: Establish a list of shared household tasks and assign specific responsibilities to each person. Be specific about what needs to be done and by when. Make sure your boyfriend understands that he's not being asked to do everything, but rather to contribute equally.\n3. Use technology to your advantage: Since you've already tried to-do list apps and sticky notes, consider using a shared online calendar or task management tool to keep track of chores and deadlines. This can help your boyfriend stay organized and on top of his tasks.\n4. Offer support and encouragement: Instead of constantly reminding your boyfriend, offer to help him stay on track by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. You can also encourage him to use his strengths to his advantage, such as his creativity or problem-solving skills, to help with household tasks.\n5. Consider couples therapy: If you feel like you're at an impasse and unable to communicate effectively, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A professional can help you both navigate your communication styles and find ways to work together more effectively.\n\nRemember, it's not about being a \"mom\" to your boyfriend; it's about being a partner in a relationship. You deserve to have a sense of control and agency in your life, and it's essential to find a balance that works for both of you.\n\nTake a deep breath, and try to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. You're not alone, and there are ways to find a solution that works for both of you."

For example, \"I'm scared to talk more around people who know me as the shy guy\" becomes \"I'm taking a chance to grow and show others a new side of myself.\"\n4. **Focus on your own goals and values**: Instead of seeking external validation, focus on what's truly important to you. What are your values, passions, and goals? What do you want to achieve? When you align your actions with your values, you'll feel more fulfilled and less concerned with what others think.\n5. **Take small steps towards change**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Start with small, manageable steps towards breaking free from your mental barriers. For example, if you're afraid to flirt, start by striking up a conversation with someone you're interested in or practicing your flirting skills in a low-stakes setting.\n6. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Remember that rejection is a natural part of life, and it doesn't define your worth or abilities.\n7. **Practice mindfulness and self-care**: Regular mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Also, prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as exercise, reading, or spending time in nature.\n8. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: The people you surround yourself with can have a significant impact on your mindset. Seek out supportive friends, family, or a therapist who can help you build confidence and offer guidance.\n9. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind and understanding with yourself as you work through these changes. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories along the way. This will help you build momentum and motivation to continue working towards breaking free from your mental barriers.\n\nRemember, \"letting go\" is a process that takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. You're not alone in this journey, and with time and practice, you can develop the skills and mindset to break free from the prisons holding you back."

    "sentence": "anyone tell me what my problem is and why I'm like this? I know.. the title sounds silly.    \nhear me out.    \n\nContext: I am in Japan, wherein everyone is polite.\n\nI was in a coffee shop, standing in a corner, waiting for a seat to be vacated. It was a full house. There's different people on different areas waiting for someone to leave, so they can grab a seat. I'm specifically waiting on one corner. After waiting for about 20 minutes, the mother-daughter in a 2-person table shows sign of taking off, and I was poising to take over their seat. They took their time, and I stood there behind them for about a minute while they are packing their stuff.     \n\nAll of a sudden, there was this japanese lady who just arrived, and she noticed the two mother-daughter about to leave. She then approached them and asked if she could take their table. All the while i was behind the mother-daughter. The mother, who knew I had been standing there for 20 minutes and knew that I was going to take their place, looked confused and didn't know what to do. At this point in time, Me, with my earphone on, am visibly upset and pissed.    \nI was pissed with the fact that the Japanese didnt realize I was already there waiting. The mother talked to the lady and probably told her that I was waiting. She bowed her head, and tried to gesture that I was there behind them. The Japanese lady was embarrassed, surprised, and was confused as well. However, my initial reaction through the entire ordeal was to shake my head, did not talk to either of them, and headed out. All the while all 3 of them were looking at me, confused and dont know what to do. The Japanese was probably apologetic and embarrased, but I was angry. I waited there for 20 minutes, but I gave up on my seat. I didnt; want to take it after what happened, since I would feel awkward and feel that I stole a seat from the Japanese lady, even though I didnt. Maybe I felt wronged by, and didnt bother fighting for the seat since I didnt want to beg for a seat. \n\nAfter leaving, I'm still super pissed and angry.\nI dont know why I couldnt stay there and take the seat after the entire ordeal. I'm not sure if im pissed at myself, or the lady. \nI dont know why my behavior is like these in these kind of scenarios.\n\nAnyone have any idea?",
    "human": "Three-year Tokyo resident here.\n\n* Next time do what the Japanese lady did and ask instead of just passively standing there. When I'm packing up my stuff I have old ladies asking me if they can sit there all the time. \n* Don't get pissed over a seat in a cafe. It's just a seat. In a cafe.",
    "base_reply": "I think I can help you identify what might be going on here. It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of entitlement and a sense of injustice when you're not prioritized or recognized in a situation.\n\nIn this case, it seems like you were waiting for a seat for 20 minutes, and you felt like you had a legitimate claim to it. When the Japanese lady swooped in and asked the mother-daughter to vacate the table, you felt like you were being ignored or overlooked. This might have triggered a sense of frustration and anger, especially since you'd been waiting for so long.\n\nIt's also possible that you're struggling with the cultural norms of politeness in Japan, where it's common to prioritize others and avoid conflict. You might have felt like the Japanese lady was being rude or inconsiderate by not noticing you or recognizing your priority, and this felt like a personal affront.\n\nYour reaction, however, was to become visibly upset and angry, which might not have been the most effective way to handle the situation. By not speaking up or communicating your needs, you might have come across as rude or entitled yourself.\n\nI think it's worth exploring why you felt the need to prioritize your own sense of entitlement over the situation. Were you worried about being seen as rude or impolite? Were you concerned about being perceived as entitled or selfish? These are important questions to consider, as they might be related to deeper insecurities or values that you're struggling with.\n\nLastly, it's also possible that you're simply feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with the constant politeness and consideration that's expected in Japanese culture. It can be exhausting to always prioritize others' needs and desires, and it's natural to feel like you're losing yourself in the process.\n\nI hope this helps you start to understand what might be driving your behavior in these situations. Remember that it's okay to prioritize yourself and set boundaries, but it's also important to do so in a way that's respectful and considerate of others."

    "sentence": "follow your dreams or grow up? This is rather long so I appreciate it if you're reading it.\n\nI'm 18. I don't know how the educational system works in so many countries but here, students decide their general area of studies according to which their lessons differ. This happens at the age of 15. Two most popular one are science and math. Science for the ones who want to become doctors, dentists, chemists, nurses etc. Math for those who want to become engineers, mathematicians etc. For 3 years we study exclusive lessons and after the 3 years, we have an entrance exam. Any student who wants enter universities has to take this exam. There are 2 types of universities here. Ones that are free of expenses and the government pays for everything you need and ones you have to pay for your courses yourself. When people take this exam, they are ranked from best to worst and according to their own interests they can chooses 150 majors and universities they want to study in. They have to be prioritized and according to your ranking, the first major &amp; university you've chosen that you're good enough to be accepted in will take you. There's a lot of rivalry here and everybody wants good majors in good universities. I chose science. For the ones who choose science, medicine is the hardest major to get . The exam used to be normal with sensible questions. In the last decade the number of participants has grown remarkably so the questions have gotten way harder and honestly incredibly stupid. Too detailed in an unreasonable way. And don't get me wrong this is not coming from one of those students who hate studying and barely manage to get a 15 at a exam. During 12 years of school and high school I have always been the top student. So when I tell you this exam is stupid , I'm hoping you'd take my word for it and believe me when I say this is the worst thing ever. I wanted to be successful at it ,of course, so I had to study hard. The common way is , if you want to be very successful at this shit you should study at least 8 or 9 hours a day, for at least a year. For a year you should let go of almost any sort of happiness and fun and spend all your time studying. The pressure is too much and personally speaking, I experienced serious sleep deprivation and felt really depressed during this \"one year\". The educational system here is not good at all , obviously, and this is the worst of it. My exam was 3 months ago and I got the results a while ago. It was fantastic. I was accepted for medicine in one of the best universities in the country.\n\nNow, 3 years ago I had to choose between math and science but it was really hard for me to choose. At last I chose science but I kept my doubts. I don't dislike medicine, but I'm not crazy about it either. My dream job was to study computer science/ computer engineering and learn how to code games and end up working in a big and famous game company. I knew I wanted this more than medicine but I had to face some facts. Some countries care so much about games and have so many game companies you can work in. The job opportunities is great. But my country is not one of them and in fact, there's not so many job opportunities for this job around here. So one thing I knew was that if I wanted to go for it I had to immigrate. Immigration is not that simple and requires money. My family is here as well and I have NO ONE in any of these countries. So there was a chance I never immigrated and if so, I'd be stuck here with no job and future. Immigration can get easier if you get accepted in the best universities but that was a big risk. This entrance exam basically decides your whole life and future in 4 hours! I didn't know how I was gonna do in it, whether I could get accepted in the best universities on not, whether I could Immigrate or not. It took me so long but I finally decided I should use my head on this and let this dream go because it was too unlikely. I decided it wasn't worth gambling my whole life and future on. My decision was final until a few weeks ago.\n\nMy university classes start tomorrow. I'll be starting my path as a student of medicine and I'm terrified. Medicine is so so hard. So I've been thinking, I had the ability to become this successful. Maybe I would've gotten what I wanted had I persued my dream! Funny how my own success only makes me feel worse. I see how hard medicine is and I wonder, if I'm to study this hard, maybe I could just do it for something I wanted way more. I'm freaked out at the thought of regretting my decision in a few years. I don't blame myself for any of my decisions. I made the right ones with every piece of knowledge I had at that moment. But every time I watch a movie or something with a character deciding to \"pursue their dreams\", which always ends well for them, my doubts return. Was I a coward or did I make a decision using my head, and these are just movies about imaginary characters with a lot of luck and no real life problems? I think with myself \"If I want to change something, today is less late than 7 years from now. How long am I going to carry these doubts. What if they never let me go and I'll never be satisfied with my life?\". I thought about changing to math a few days ago but for that to happen I should take the entrance exam again and I DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT NIGHTMARE AGAIN. Have I lost my only chance for happiness or am I going too hard on myself? I never believed in the whole \"follow your dreams\" thing because I think there should be a balance between your heart and your head. And life isn't always that kind. You should evaluate your chances and think wisely. But I have never failed in my 18 years of life. I have always been successful and I'm going to try to continue that way. Did I underestimate myself? Did I give in to life difficulties or was I wise to choose the safe path.\n\nSorry it got so long. Thanks for reading. And forgive me if there are any grammatical mistakes. I'm not a native English speaker.",

I would think programming them could be similar to gaming somehow. Best of luck in your life journey, regardless!",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've shared a lot of your thoughts and feelings with me, and I appreciate your honesty. It's clear that you're struggling with the idea of following your dreams versus making a practical decision.\n\nFirstly, let me acknowledge that you made a decision based on the circumstances you were in at the time. You weighed your options and chose the path that seemed most likely to lead to success and stability. That takes a lot of courage and maturity.\n\nNow, it's natural to wonder if you made the right choice, especially when you see others pursuing their passions and achieving their dreams. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that you should have followed your heart, but the truth is that life is full of uncertainties, and it's not always possible to know what the right choice is.\n\nYou're right to acknowledge that you made a decision using your head, and that's something to be proud of. It's easy to get caught up in emotions and make impulsive decisions, but you took the time to think carefully about your options and choose the path that seemed most likely to lead to success.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to acknowledge that you did compromise on your dreams. You wanted to study computer science and work in the gaming industry, but you knew that the job opportunities were limited in your country. You chose a safer path, which is understandable, but it's natural to feel a sense of regret or longing for what could have been.\n\nThe question is, what do you want to do now? You're starting your studies in medicine, and you're feeling terrified. It's natural to feel overwhelmed, but you're also wondering if you could have done something differently. The good news is that you still have time to explore your interests and passions, even if you're not pursuing them directly.\n\nYou could consider taking online courses or attending workshops or conferences related to computer science or game development. You could also try to find ways to incorporate your interests into your studies or work in the medical field. The key is to find ways to make your studies meaningful and fulfilling, even if they're not exactly what you wanted.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you made a decision based on the circumstances you were in. You can't change the past, but you can learn from your experiences and find ways to make the most of your present and future.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to make mistakes. The important thing is to be honest with yourself and others, and to keep moving forward with an open mind and a willingness to learn."

    "sentence": "Hey Reddit. Finally caved and posted this here because I want to try and find something like an unbiased opinion. Some backstory first. My mom (48F) and my dad (49M) broke up when I was 2, never officially married. My mom remarried to my stepdad (50M) when I was 4, and they had my two half brothers (15M and 6M). I am a transgender man, and started my transition last year when I went to college.\n\nMy mom is pretty outgoing, and has lots of meetups and friends her age. She's in a bookclub, part of a gym, and in two parenting groups with other moms (because of my brothers). Despite this, she's pretty lonely, and confides in me about her insecurities and struggles from 5th grade on. I was her only daughter, and I think she saw herself in me.\n\nShe told me that she's disappointed with my 15 year old brother, who is my opposite in every way personality-wise, and told me that she was trying to have a third child to prove she was a good parent despite her \"failings\" with my brother. She told me about her marital problems, her miscarriages, and how she thinks my brother is abusing her. I am the only person she ever told about a molestation attempt she experienced when she was younger (I was 17 when she told me this).\n\nI have autism, despite my mother's anti-vaccine status, which manifested in extremely poor social skills. I have only had 2-3 friends for my entire life, all of which I met in kindergarten. As such, my parents were really my only social connection for most of my life, as I wasn't allowed to use the internet until high school. I never really enjoyed being at my mom's house, but I was there most days because my dad works full time and my mom stayed at home, as my stepdad is very wealthy.\n\nI went to college abroad, partly because it's way cheaper (I'm from the US), and partly because I didn't want to spend time with my mom. When I got there, I used the opportunity to tell everyone my new name and pronouns and do a complete social transition. I told my dad, who was accepting, but hesitated to tell my mom, as she has a very rigid understanding of gender roles. However, when I came back for Christmas, I was accidentally outed to her.\n\nShe lost it at me and screamed at me for an hour, accusing me of lying to her and destroying our relationship. She said I only became a man because I hated her, and asked me how I would feel if I kept things from her.\n\nSince then, I feel that our relationship has continued to deteriorate. I feel like she is trying to relate to me now that I'm an adult, but every conversation we have makes me more and more uncomfortable. She told me that she loved me more than anyone else in the world, including my two younger brothers. She told me that my biological father was tired of handling my problems, and that he no longer wanted to see me or talk to me (she told me that wasn't real a week later). She told me that she didn't want children until she had me, and that I was biologically destined to both become pregnant and enjoy it. Finally, she told me that I couldn't be a man until I touched another man's...genitals. This last point she brought up multiple times, until she told me that she had talked to my stepdad about having some kind of genital encounter, just the two of us.\n\nI feel crazy, and isolated, and I don't understand what to do. I want to pull away from my mom, but I don't want to leave my brothers alone. Every time I try to talk to someone about what's going on I just feel more alone. My 15 year old brother and I don't really get along, and he thinks I'm overreacting. My 6 year old brother is too young for any of this. My relationship with my stepdad is falling apart after that conversation with my mom. I don't know if I should tell my dad, and I don't really have any friends to talk to or stay with.\n\nIs this normal? Am I overreacting? What should I do? I left out some other stuff that I wasn't sure was relevant, I'll try my best to answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: My mom keeps telling me stuff I really wish she would keep to herself, including stuff about her problems and my body. It's affecting my other family relationships, as well as my sense of self.",
    "human": "&gt; she told me that she had talked to my stepdad about having some kind of genital encounter, just the two of us.\n\nJesus fucking Christ. So your mother is basically saying \"you need to have a sexual experience as a woman before you can be certain you really feel like a man, I've asked your stepfather if he could do that with you.\" \n\nYour mother is not a safe or sane person, and you are not safe with her. I don't think she'd harm you physically (and I hope to god your stepfather wouldn't), but she is incredibly damaging on an emotional and mental level. \n\nIf you have a good relationship with your dad, reach out to him. If you don't, do what you can to get back abroad and away from your mother. \n\nYour mother doesn't see you as an individual person, she sees you as an extension of herself. She likes the *idea* of you (a mini-me she can live vicariously through) more than she respects you as an autonomous human being. \n\nYour first step is to get away. Your second step is to pursue therapy. The key words you want to remember are \"parentification\" and \"covert incest\".\n\n&gt; My 15 year old brother and I don't really get along, and he thinks I'm overreacting. My 6 year old brother is too young for any of this\n\nHonestly, your 15yo brother is too young for this also. Too young to recognise the severity of how wrong your mother's behaviour is because it's all he's ever known.  Same for you, you were also too young for this. Your mother parentified you, and it has harmed you. You need to get away from her. \n\nWhat is your relationship with your stepfather like? Could you send him a letter explaining your reasons for stepping back from the family so he can do what he can to protect your brothers from your mother?",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a really challenging and isolating experience. First, let me say that it's not normal for a parent to share such intimate and personal details with their child, especially about their own desires or fantasies. It's understandable that you feel uncomfortable and unsure about what to do.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your mom's behavior may be a result of her own insecurities and unresolved issues, rather than anything you've done. Her accusations that you're lying to her or trying to destroy your relationship may be a projection of her own feelings of inadequacy or shame.\n\nGiven your history of social struggles and autism, it's not surprising that you feel overwhelmed and isolated. It's great that you're seeking support and trying to find a way to navigate this situation.\n\nAs for what to do, I would recommend taking care of yourself first and foremost. This may mean setting boundaries with your mom and limiting your interactions with her until you feel more comfortable. You may also want to consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to deal with this alone. While your 15-year-old brother may not be supportive, it's possible that your 6-year-old brother may be more receptive to your needs and feelings. You may also want to reach out to your dad again, or consider seeking support from other family members or trusted friends.\n\nRemember that your well-being and autonomy are important, and you deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Don't be afraid to prioritize your own needs and take care of yourself during this difficult time."

    "base_reply": "Selling a car and buying a new one can be a daunting process, especially if it's your first time. I'm happy to help you navigate it.\n\nFirstly, you're correct that trading in your car might not be the best option, especially since you're looking to maximize the value of your 08 Mustang. Trading in usually results in a lower sale price, as dealerships need to make a profit. Instead, consider selling it privately or through a third-party service.\n\nHere are some tips to help you sell your car:\n\n1. **Get an appraisal**: Research your car's market value using tools like Kelley Blue Book or National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guides. This will give you a baseline price to work from.\n2. **Gather documents**: Make sure you have all the necessary documents, such as the title, service records, and any repair estimates. This will help potential buyers feel more confident in their purchase.\n3. **Take high-quality photos**: Showcase your car's best features by taking clear, well-lit photos of the interior and exterior. Avoid showing any damage or wear.\n4. **Write a detailed description**: Highlight your car's positive features, such as its condition, mileage, and any recent maintenance. Be honest about any flaws, but don't exaggerate.\n5. **Set a competitive price**: Based on your research, set a price that's competitive with similar listings in your area. You can also consider starting with a slightly higher price and negotiating down.\n6. **Be prepared for questions**: Potential buyers will likely ask about the car's history, maintenance, and any issues. Be prepared to answer these questions honestly and provide documentation to support your claims.\n\nAs for buying a new car, consider the following:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**: Look into different models, read reviews, and compare features to find the best fit for your needs and budget.\n2. **Check the safety ratings**: Make sure the car you choose has good safety ratings and features, especially since you'll have a baby on the way.\n3. **Test drive, test drive, test drive**: Don't settle for a car without taking it for a spin. This will help you get a feel for its performance, comfort, and any quirks.\n4. **Check the warranty and maintenance costs**: Consider the length of the warranty and estimated maintenance costs for the car you're interested in.\n5. **Don't rush**: Take your time, and don't feel pressured to make a decision on the spot. Sleep on it, and come back to the car with a clear head.\n\nSome common pitfalls to avoid include:\n\n* Not doing your research, leading to buyer's remorse\n* Not being transparent about the car's condition, which can lead to disputes or a lower sale price\n* Not negotiating the price or terms of the sale\n* Not considering the long-term costs of ownership, such as maintenance and insurance\n\nRemember, selling a car and buying a new one requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to do your research. Stay calm, and you'll be well on your way to a successful transaction!"

It's great that you're taking the time to educate yourself and prioritize your financial well-being.\n\nRegarding the LPT (Long Post on the internet) you mentioned, I think you might be referring to the recent flood damage from Hurricane Ian in Florida. Yes, it's true that the storm caused widespread flooding, and many cars were damaged or destroyed. However, the impact on the used car market is more nuanced than just \"people selling cars that drowned.\"\n\nWhat you should lookout for when buying a used car, regardless of the current market situation, are:\n\n1. **Check the vehicle history report**: Make sure to get a detailed report from services like Carfax or AutoCheck to identify any potential issues with the car's ownership history, accidents, or damage.\n2. **Inspect the car thoroughly**: Look for signs of water damage, rust, or corrosion, especially if the car was exposed to floodwaters. Check the dashboard, carpets, and trunk for any signs of water intrusion.\n3. **Test drive the car**: Take the car for a spin and pay attention to how it handles, any unusual noises, or vibrations. If you notice anything unusual, it's best to walk away.\n4. **Check the maintenance records**: Review the maintenance records to ensure the car has been properly serviced and maintained.\n5. **Get a mechanic's inspection**: Consider hiring a mechanic to inspect the car and identify any potential issues before you buy.\n6. **Negotiate the price**: Use the inspection and research to negotiate a fair price for the car.\n7. **Consider certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles**: If you're buying from a dealership, look for CPO vehicles, which have been inspected and certified by the manufacturer or dealership.\n\nRegarding the current market situation, it's true that there might be an influx of flood-damaged cars on the market. However, reputable dealerships and sellers will typically disclose any issues with the vehicle's history. If you're buying from a private seller, make sure to ask plenty of questions and do your due diligence.\n\nLastly, don't feel pressured to rush into a purchase. Take your time, and prioritize your financial well-being. Remember, a used car should be a practical and reliable investment for you, not a stressful or costly mistake.\n\nI hope this helps! 😊"

In fact, being single can be a beautiful opportunity to focus on yourself, your personal growth, and your own happiness.\n\nSo, how to not be crazy about not being in a relationship? Well, first of all, it's important to recognize that it's okay to be single. It's okay to not have a partner. It's okay to focus on yourself and your own journey. And it's okay to take your time and not rush into anything that doesn't feel right.\n\nHere's what I want to say to all the singles out there: you are not alone. You are not missing out on something essential to your existence. You are just as worthy and deserving of love and happiness as anyone else, regardless of your relationship status.\n\nAnd to those who are feeling pressure from others, I want to say that you don't have to justify your single status to anyone. You don't have to explain yourself or make excuses. You don't have to feel guilty or ashamed. You are enough just as you are, and that's all that matters.\n\nSo, how to cope with the pressure? Well, here are a few things that might help:\n\n1. Practice self-care. Focus on your own well-being, your own happiness, and your own growth.\n2. Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who love and accept you for who you are.\n3. Find activities and hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n4. Practice mindfulness and self-compassion. Be kind to yourself, and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.\n5. And most importantly, remember that your worth and value come from within. You are not defined by your relationship status. You are a unique, special, and valuable person, regardless of whether you're in a relationship or not.\n\nI hope these words of wisdom help, my friend!"

Here's a simple yet effective strategy to help you focus on your own accomplishments and stop comparing:\n\n1. **Track your progress**: Start a journal or use a habit-tracking app to monitor your daily, weekly, or monthly progress. Focus on your own goals, achievements, and milestones. This will help you see how far you've come and what you've accomplished.\n2. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, no matter how insignificant they may seem. This will help you develop a growth mindset and recognize that progress is not always linear.\n3. **Reframe comparisons**: When you find yourself comparing, pause and reframe the thought. Ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this person's success?\" or \"How can I apply their strategies to my own life?\" Instead of focusing on what you lack, focus on what you can gain.\n4. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who support and uplift you, and avoid social media platforms that make you feel bad about yourself. Follow accounts that inspire and motivate you, rather than those that make you feel inferior.\n5. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: When you catch yourself comparing, take a deep breath and remind yourself that everyone is on their own journey. Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you'd offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n6. **Focus on your why**: Reflect on your values, passions, and long-term goals. What drives you? What makes you feel fulfilled and purposeful? Focus on aligning your actions with your \"why\" and celebrate the progress you make towards your goals.\n7. **Set realistic expectations**: Recognize that everyone has their own struggles and setbacks. Don't compare your behind-the-scenes moments to someone else's highlight reel. Set realistic expectations and focus on your own journey.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to change your mindset. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With consistent effort, you'll become more comfortable focusing on your own accomplishments and celebrating your unique progress."

So some girls come to me every now and then and i fuck it up so bad every single time, you'd think it was a comedy movie that depended on uncomfortable situations to be funny.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're seeking advice and willing to confront your awkwardness! It's great that you're self-aware and acknowledging the issue.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the concept of \"awkwardness.\" Awkwardness is often a result of feeling uncertain, nervous, or unprepared in social situations. It's not a fixed trait; it's a skill that can be improved with practice, self-reflection, and a willingness to learn.\n\nHere are some actionable tips to help you become less awkward:\n\n1. **Self-acceptance**: Recognize that it's okay to be awkward. Everyone is awkward at some point or another. It's a normal part of the human experience. Instead of beating yourself up over it, focus on improving and being kind to yourself.\n2. **Practice self-reflection**: Take time to understand what makes you feel awkward. Is it a specific situation, person, or topic? Once you identify the triggers, you can work on building confidence and preparing for those situations.\n3. **Improve your communication skills**: Practice active listening, ask open-ended questions, and focus on the other person's interests. This will help you build connections and reduce awkward silences.\n4. **Be present in the moment**: When you're in a social situation, focus on the present moment. Avoid overthinking or worrying about the future or past. This will help you stay grounded and more confident.\n5. **Develop a growth mindset**: View social interactions as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as sources of anxiety or embarrassment. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and learn from your mistakes.\n6. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who make you feel comfortable and supported. This can help you build confidence and develop a more positive self-image.\n7. **Take calculated risks**: Step out of your comfort zone and take calculated risks in social situations. This will help you build confidence and develop a sense of comfort in unfamiliar environments.\n8. **Learn from your mistakes**: When you do make mistakes, use them as opportunities to learn and grow. Reflect on what went wrong and how you can improve next time.\n9. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused in social situations. Try taking a few deep breaths, noticing your thoughts and emotions, and refocusing on the present moment.\n10. **Seek help if needed**: If you're struggling with persistent social anxiety or feelings of inadequacy, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with personalized guidance and support.\n\nAs for your specific concerns about being a virgin, remember that it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Focus on building meaningful connections with others, and the right person will come along when the time is right.\n\nRemember, becoming socially fluent takes time and practice.

However, it's also important to consider the practical implications of having a 15-year-old girl (biologically) in a bedroom, even if she identifies as male.\n\nI would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your son about your concerns and values. You can explain that while you're happy to have his friend over, you still have concerns about the safety and boundaries of having a girl in the bedroom. You can also express your desire to create a comfortable and respectful environment for everyone involved.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider setting some ground rules or boundaries that work for everyone. For example, you could suggest having the friend sleep over in a different room, or having a designated \"hangout\" area that's not in the bedroom. You could also discuss with your son what he's comfortable with and what he's not, and work together to find a solution that respects everyone's boundaries.\n\nIt's also important to remember that having open and honest communication is key. Make sure to listen to your son's perspective and concerns, and be willing to adapt your approach as needed.\n\nAs for the rule of no sleepovers, it's understandable that you're hesitant to make an exception, but it's also important to consider the individual circumstances.

The most important thing is to prioritize respect, communication, and safety for everyone involved."

This can be a great way to build rapport and create a sense of connection.

For example:\n\n* \"Oh, I'm actually a fan of [related topic]. What about you?\" (Changes the subject and shows interest in the other person)\n* \"I'm more of a [insert alternative holiday plan]. How about you?\" (Avoids getting into specifics, but still shows you're engaged)\n* \"I'm really looking forward to [upcoming event].

Let him know that you understand it's their native language, but sometimes you feel a bit left out or curious about what's being said.

I'm finally returning to my friends and family from being abroad for over a year, but the return is still four months away. While I have had amazing experiences and I'm sure many to come, I absolutely can't wait to get back! \n\nI'm not one to advocate making your time speed up, and I while I am very involved and taking up my time, the thought of \"4 months  and x days left!\" seems very daunting.",

Since you're not one to rush time, let's focus on making the most of your remaining time abroad instead of counting down the days.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to focus on the present moment and the experiences you're still having. Instead of thinking about the end goal, try to appreciate the small joys and moments that make your current situation worthwhile. Whether it's a beautiful sunset, a new language you're learning, or a newfound skill, acknowledge and celebrate these small victories.\n\nAnother approach is to set smaller, achievable goals for yourself in the next few months. This could be as simple as completing a project, taking a cooking class, or volunteering in your community. Having a sense of accomplishment and purpose can help make the time pass more enjoyably.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to your friends and family back home and sharing your feelings with them. Sometimes, talking about our emotions and desires can help us feel more connected and less alone. You could even plan a virtual gathering or video call to stay in touch and look forward to your reunion.\n\nRemember, four months might seem like a long time, but it's also an opportunity to grow, learn, and create new memories. Try to find the beauty in the present and focus on making the most of your time abroad."

For most of the time things were decent, barring the usual couples fights here and there. \n\nUnfortunately things have gone downhill quickly since the pandemic, as I’m sure is common in relationships these days. For the most part we get along well, but the excitement has all but dried up, along with our intimacy. \n\nLife is very routine, but also very demanding between work, chores, and taking care of our small dog (which acts like a child, but least we don’t have any real children). We both work from home and have very little time apart. \n\nWe have tried to make it work—we do vacations, date nights, friend meetups, etc. At the end of the day though, it just feels almost like we are roommates. Don’t get me wrong, she is attractive, but the mystery and passion is just not there anymore. I often find myself fantasizing about other women, and I know she has the same thoughts, although I would never cheat on her. \n\nIs it normal to feel this way? Should I be doing more to “desire” her? Our marriage is on the brink of collapse and I am not sure if I should try to save it or let it go. We have tried so hard for so long. When is it time to move on?\n\nTL;DR: The intimacy is gone from my marriage after 2 years of work from home, and now it seems almost hopeless to repair.",

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and uncertain about the future of your marriage.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way, especially during the pandemic. The lack of physical touch, social interaction, and emotional connection can take a toll on relationships. It's not uncommon for couples to feel disconnected and demotivated.\n\nRegarding your feelings of fantasizing about other women, it's essential to recognize that this is a common phenomenon in many relationships, especially when intimacy is lacking. It's not necessarily a sign that you're looking to cheat or that your marriage is doomed, but rather a sign that you're human and your brain is seeking novelty and excitement.\n\nAs for whether you should try to \"desire\" your partner more, I'd say that it's not about forcing feelings or trying to manufacture a certain level of passion. Instead, it's about acknowledging that relationships evolve, and it's normal for the spark to fade over time. The key is to identify the underlying issues and work together to address them.\n\nSince you've tried various attempts to reignite the flame, such as vacations and date nights, it might be time to explore deeper issues. Have you and your partner talked about your feelings, desires, and needs with each other? Are there any underlying resentments, unmet expectations, or unaddressed issues that could be contributing to the lack of intimacy?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that relationships are not just about romance and intimacy. A fulfilling partnership is about mutual respect, trust, communication, and shared values. If you feel like you're just existing as roommates, it might be worth exploring whether the foundation of your relationship is strong enough to support a rekindling of passion.\n\nUltimately, whether to try to save the marriage or move on depends on your individual circumstances and priorities. If you're willing to put in the effort to work through the issues and rebuild your connection, it's worth exploring. However, if you feel like you've given it your all and it's still not working, it might be time to re-evaluate your priorities and consider what's best for your own well-being.\n\nRemember, it's okay to acknowledge that relationships can be imperfect, and sometimes, it's better to prioritize your own happiness and growth."

I left the country for a few years but now we're living not even 10 minutes away from each other.\n\nI planned out a whole nice day for us to spend together. Last time we hung out was because she, quite spontaneously, invited me out to do an activity I had been trying to plan out with her. We used to spend every halloween together. This year, she declines. Sometimes she'll shoot down my plans because shes sick, but the same day she'll go out shopping and text me about it. We havent hung out since the start of the month.\n\nThe day before the planned day where we'd get to spend some quality time at a nice place and then have dinner together at hers with ingredients I got for us, she sends me a message declining. At midnight, actually, so technically day-of. In that message she acknowledges and apologises for being so flakey, saying it's not fair to me. She has a good reason, but when every time she declines she has a valid excuse, and it makes it feel... less valid? She then says that we could still do dinner in the evening.\n\nThe next day comes and she never contacts me, so I make plans with someone else.\n\nI'm worried. She's always struggled with anxiety/depression/mood stuff, which I understand. She had a recent hospital trip for her mental health, which she was quite explicit in telling me about. Though Ive tried asserting boundaries about talking to me about things like that without warning, I can't blame her for the state she was in. She's also having a lot of issues with her boyfriend of a year, and I'm concerned he's taking up all her time and energy.\n\nAll this to ask how I should go about this. She's now trying to resume conversation as if nothing happened (cancelled plans, never following up), but I'm honestly quite upset/done with it all. I don't know how I should approach this situation. Wait for her to reach out and talk to me? Confront her over text? I just miss my best friend.\n\nTD;LR: My best friend of 10 years never makes time to see me.

It's admirable that you've tried to be supportive, even when it's challenging.\n\nNow, regarding your question, I would suggest taking a step back and giving yourself some space to process your emotions before deciding on a course of action. It's okay to feel upset and done with the situation, but rushing into confrontation or confrontation-like texts might not be the most effective way to resolve things.\n\nInstead, consider sending a calm and honest message expressing your feelings and concerns. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey [friend's name], I'm feeling a bit hurt and frustrated that we haven't been able to spend time together lately. I understand that life gets busy, but it feels like I've been trying to plan things with you for a while now, and it keeps getting cancelled. I miss our friendship and would love to catch up. If you're not interested in spending time with me, I understand, but I'd appreciate some clarity on what's going on. Can we talk about this?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're willing to listen and understand her perspective while also communicating your own feelings and needs. It's a gentle yet assertive way to address the situation and may help you both have a more open and honest conversation.\n\nRemember that you can't force someone to prioritize your friendship or make time for you, but by expressing your feelings and concerns, you're taking a step towards setting boundaries and prioritizing your own emotional well-being."

I'm happy to help you explore some solutions.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that there's no one-size-fits-all solution, and it's great that you're not looking for someone to organize your life for you. You're taking the first step by recognizing the need for better time management.\n\nRegarding your question about scheduling programs, there are many options available that can sync between your phone and laptop. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. Google Calendar (integrated with Gmail): Yes, Google Calendar is a fantastic option! It's free, user-friendly, and integrates seamlessly with Gmail. You can access it on your phone, laptop, and even on the web. Google Calendar is great for scheduling appointments, events, and reminders. You can also share calendars with others, which is perfect for family or work-related tasks.\n2. Todoist: A popular task management app that allows you to create and prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. It also has a calendar view, making it easy to visualize your schedule. Todoist is available on both mobile and desktop.\n3. Trello: A visual project management tool that uses boards, lists, and cards to organize tasks. You can create separate boards for work, personal tasks, and family responsibilities. Trello has mobile and desktop apps.\n4. Evernote: A note-taking app that also has a calendar feature. You can create notes, to-do lists, and reminders, and sync them across devices.\n\nAs for tips to stay on top of your schedule:\n\n1. Start small: Begin by setting realistic goals and breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks.\n2. Prioritize: Identify your most important tasks and focus on those first.\n3. Set reminders: Use your chosen scheduling program to set reminders for upcoming deadlines, appointments, or tasks.\n4. Review regularly: Schedule regular review sessions to check your progress, adjust your schedule as needed, and plan for the next day or week.\n5. Make it a habit: Try to make your scheduling routine a consistent part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower.\n6. Use the Pomodoro Technique: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n7. Delegate tasks: If possible, delegate tasks to others to free up time for more important responsibilities.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and stick to it. Experiment with different tools and methods until you find what suits your lifestyle best.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize the importance of self-care and taking breaks. As a new parent and full-time student, it's essential to prioritize your well-being and take time for yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get everything done immediately – it's a process, and it's okay to adapt and adjust as needed.\n\nKeep in mind that it might take some time to figure out what works best for you, but with patience and persistence, you'll get there. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance!"

This approach shows that you're engaged and interested, but also that you have limited time or attention to devote to the conversation.\n\nAnother option is to use a nonverbal cue, like placing your hand on your watch or glancing at your phone, to signal that you're running low on time or attention.

You might be thinking, \"Why should I have to do everything while he gets to take a break and get some rest?\"\n\nBefore reacting, take a step back and try to separate your feelings from the practicalities. Ask yourself:\n\n* Is your husband's sleep deprivation affecting his ability to function and care for the baby and you?\n* Would his mom's offer actually benefit the whole family, especially the baby, if it means your husband gets some much-needed rest?\n* Are there other ways to address the sleep issue, such as adjusting your own sleep schedule, establishing a consistent bedtime routine, or exploring other childcare options?\n\nIf you're still feeling anxious or upset, consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about your concerns.

    "sentence": "TL;DR- My ex is being abused by his current wife and I’m about tired of it and don’t know what to do.\n\nA bit of background. I’ve 39F known my ex 43M for 21 years. We got married stupid young (18 and 22) as is very common in the military lol. Seriously though, he was a great husband and we spent 13 good years together until his fourth and final combat tour. It really changed him. It was incredibly violent deployment and they lost a lot of guys. I have no shame in saying that I had a difficult time coping with the fallout and we both certainly didn’t have the tools to be a effective supportive partners for each other. He became an alcoholic overnight and I joined him because I was desperate to connect with him on any level. That obviously was not a sustainable way to live together and my kids needed one of us to be stable. We eventually ended our marriage amicably. We still remained best friends and co-parented well together until he met his current wife.\n\nSimply put, I never stood a chance with her. It’s almost comical how completely opposite we are and I still wonder “why her?!?” but that’s his business not mine. Everything about me from my looks, to my style, to my parenting, to my job, to my beliefs, and moral code were all offensive to her and she made it known. So she went on a mission to fix him. But fixing him looked like bringing him up to her standard. Everything about him started changing. His whole clothing style, his vehicle, his religious and political beliefs, and his parenting style. He even stopped being a fan of a sports team he loved because it was connected to me. She literally made him return a bag full of jerseys, shirts, basically anything team related. It blew me away.\n\nThen it appeared that I was next on the list of things to change in his life. She wanted to completely erase my presence in his life. I got another return of stuff but this time it was all his copies of our family photos from our marriage, including baby and family history pictures. She was/is also adamant that he is to never speak to me alone. When we’d meet to trade off kids, she had to accompany him. If she couldn’t go she would send her older teen daughters, failing that she would track him on Life360 and start calling when his “time was up” and we’re talking 5 mins. Our trade off time is usually when we would talk about kid stuff. Then, it escalated to fighting about me loud enough that our children heard. She would either badger him about still being in love with me or trying to character- assassinate and devalue me. Again, loud enough and often enough my kids would hear. They would come home upset because they hurt hearing awful things about me they knew to not be true. They also hated seeing their dad being beat down verbally. These fights would also escalate very loudly because my ex still drinks heavily and would lose his temper. \n\nNow we are in this cycle where she will force him to call or text me over whatever she has decided she is upset about. She HAS TO witness him him do it and often coaches him in the background. He will try  to dutifully put me in my place or be really cold and mean. He will say or demand things that I honestly used to get so angry and defensive about. \n\nHere’s the kicker though!! Without fail, usually within an hour or so, he will sneak off and call me privately to explain. In those private conversations I see the man that’s I’ve always known.  He’s calm, reasonable, apologetic, and almost always tells me what the real deal is. Then he and I will figure out how to resolve her issue so he can live more peacefully. Basically, she feels like she wins but nothing changes between him and I. Even our kids have adapted to this method. I realize this isn’t the best solution. \n\nAs sad as it is, he has to hide our friendship. They’ve had a few knock-down fights that he’s called me for advice on but had to pretend to go to the store to call me. He’s come over and gotten drunk with my long term partner and spilled his guts but again, he covered his tracks to hide it. She popped him in the face one night and he took off and ended up at the bar crying on the phone to me. My partner and I went to the bar and took care of him. Put him up in our guest room but not before we turned off his location services. All that to say, I’m never gonna give up on the guy but it gets hard to deal with sometimes. \n\nI personally believe he’s being emotionally and financially abused at a minimum. When things get bad between them, she will threaten to get him fired, publicly humiliate him, make false claims, and she threatens to destroy him financially in divorce court. Knowing her, she would and could do it.  She controls their finances completely. Her family is well connected at his job plus she’s really been able to manipulate him into a position where he will lose his everything.  I know I need to stay available to him in case he decides to ever leave but after going through another cycle of disrupting my day with her grievances and his apology call have left me frustrated and tired.\n\nI also want to say that I’m not completely innocent here. I am sure I’ve thrown attitude and said things BEFORE I figured this fucking pattern out. All I ever wanted was to continue co-parenting as well as we all were before her arrival. \n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. It is becoming very hard for me to keep myself in check. I have never ever let anyone talk to me and treat me so disrespectfully without getting the full weight of my response. She knows as well as I do that the only thing that saves her from me is my ex and my kids. I have about 3 more years until my youngest is 18. It’s going to be a long 3 years. \n\nTL;DR- My ex is being abused by his current wife and I’m about tired of it and don’t know what to do.\n\nEDIT- My question here is only about myself and my  ex. My children are with me full time and always have been. They have weekend/holiday visitation with them. I have been sober since the divorce and my children both have therapists they are actively engaged with about this. This is strictly about the dynamic between him and I mostly.Just in case anyone missed it:\n\nI have my kids full time and they have standard visitation with him. My children are both in therapy and are actively engaged with their therapists about this. They are both finding the boundaries that work for each of them. They do want to see their dad and they “do what they have to” in order to have a peaceful time with him. It’s unhealthy, we all recognize that. \n\nI truly am trying to figure out how to manage my relationship with my oldest friend. I wouldn’t ever abandon any friend in this kind of relationship and I’m sorry but I can’t not be there for him but yes, clearly I need to speak to a therapist myself and work on some boundaries.\n\nEdit: My partner is a retired Marine and both men bonded on their own terms and have a good relationship. He is very understanding and supportive but yes, I’ve got to put some boundaries down.",

It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and tired of being pulled into this toxic dynamic. \n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing that your ex is being emotionally and financially abused, and that you're not willing to give up on him. It takes a lot of compassion and understanding to see that.\n\nIt's great that you've got your own support system in place with your partner, and that your kids are in therapy. That's a huge step forward.\n\nAs for your relationship with your ex, I think it's essential to set some boundaries for yourself. It's okay to acknowledge that you can't continue to be the emotional crutch for him, even if it's hard. You need to prioritize your own emotional well-being and learn to prioritize your own needs.\n\nI would recommend having an open and honest conversation with your ex about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're not going to engage in conversations that involve his wife's abuse or manipulation. You can express your concerns about his well-being and let him know that you're willing to support him in a more limited capacity, but you can't continue to be drawn into the drama.\n\nIt might also be helpful to establish some boundaries around communication. You could suggest that he reach out to you only when he's had time to process his emotions and has a clear head on his shoulders. That way, you're not getting pulled into his wife's drama or being used as a pawn in their games.\n\nLastly, don't forget to prioritize your own self-care. It's essential to take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and practice self-compassion. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure you're filling yourself up with love, care, and support.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep being strong, and know that you're doing the best you can under difficult circumstances."

What are my options here? \n\nTLDR: Husband has to be dragged to family events and doesn’t enjoy them. Am I being selfish for wanting him to go?\n\nUPDATE: I realize now I’m being an absolute asshole and that breaks my heart. I love this intelligent, funny, hardworking man so so so much and didn’t realize how selfish I was actually being. Thanks to everyone who answered with detailed responses helping me see that. I’m glad I came here to ask for unbiased advice, I needed it. I’m going to work on being a better spouse and accepting my husband for the introvert that he is.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE:  a lot of people are saying how ridiculous it was for me to sign him up for a 10 day trip to Disney without asking him. To clarify: I told him I was considering going for 10 days and asked if he wanted to go for 3 of those days on a weekend. I did not tell my family he would be there, they know he doesn’t like to do big family events and didn’t expect him to come, they all said I hope he comes but either way excited to spend time with you (to me). I did not ask him to go to Disney for 10 days, I asked if he would consider coming to Orlando for a long weekend, I said he could stay at the house or we could get a hotel, or maybe he could join us at Disney or just dinner or whatever. \n\nHe said he’d think about whether he wanted to come or not but that I should go if I wanted to so I made plans, it’s not abnormal for me to make plans and then he decides last minute to join. I was upset that he said he wouldn’t come at all when I was asking him to only come for a weekend. I realize how miserable he might be as an introvert at his in laws with kids doing Disney for 3 days, so I felt bad about feeling so upset he wouldn’t come. \n\nAn hour after I posted this (the morning after the argument), I felt terrible and told him sincerely that I was sorry for getting so upset, that if he really didn’t want to go I’d respect that and try not to be upset. We then spent the day at the Renaissance Fest and had a great time. Yesterday he asked me “which weekend did you want me to come to Orlando?”  I told him the dates and he said “okay I’ll book my flight” :) it’s still up in the air whether he’ll come to Disney with us those days. I’m still going to work on trying to learn more about how to understanding introvert better, and I plan on having a conversation with him to agree on an appropriate number of family/friend visits a year, how long those visits should be, making sure he has space during those visits to have alone time, etc. \n\nTo everyone who had kind words and helpful but honest responses: thank you for your candor, examples, and advice. \n\nTo everyone who was rude, shame on you. I hope you find a better outlet to take out whatever you’re going through instead of attacking someone seeking guidance through a situation that is upsetting to them.",

It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're being selfish, and I'm proud of you for doing so.\n\nFirstly, let me say that it's completely understandable that you felt upset when your husband refused to come to the family event. It's natural to want to share experiences with loved ones and feel included. However, it's also important to recognize that your husband's introversion is a valid aspect of his personality, and it's not about you or your needs, but about his own.\n\nI'm glad you're taking steps to understand and respect his boundaries. It's crucial to have open and honest communication about what works for both of you when it comes to social events and family gatherings. Having a conversation about what you both need and want can help you find a balance that works for both of you.\n\nIt's also great that you're willing to learn more about being an introvert and how to support your husband's needs. Remember that it's not about changing who he is, but about understanding and accommodating his personality.\n\nRegarding your initial question, I think you're not being selfish for wanting your husband to attend family events. However, it's important to prioritize his needs and feelings as well. Perhaps you can try to find ways to make him feel more comfortable at these events, such as giving him space or allowing him to participate in activities that he enjoys.\n\nIn the end, it's all about finding a balance and being considerate of each other's needs. I'm confident that with open communication and a willingness to understand each other's perspectives, you and your husband can navigate these situations with ease.\n\nKeep up the good work, and remember to be kind to yourself as you work on becoming a better spouse. You're already taking huge steps in the right direction!"

    "human": "Maybe you should expand your dating pool.",
    "base_reply": "The complicated web of social connections! I'm here to help you navigate this situation with honesty and care.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's understandable you're wondering about the ethics of dating Jane's sister and friend. Your primary concern is doing the right thing, and I'm here to help you weigh the pros and cons.\n\nSince Jane never mentioned your relationship to her friends, it's likely they're not aware of the details. However, it's essential to consider how your actions might affect Jane, even if your relationship didn't take off. You do have a history with her, and it's possible she might still have feelings for you.\n\nHere are some points to ponder:\n\n1. **Respect for Jane's feelings**: Even if your relationship didn't work out, Jane might still have invested emotions. Be mindful of the possibility that she might feel hurt or betrayed if she finds out you're dating her sister or friend, especially if she thought you were still on good terms.\n2. **Jane's sister and friend's perspective**: Remember that they're individuals with their own agency and feelings. If you do decide to ask them out, be prepared to handle any potential awkwardness or discomfort if Jane finds out.\n3. **Your own emotional readiness**: Take this opportunity to reflect on why you're considering dating these women. Are you genuinely interested in them, or are you seeking a distraction from your lingering feelings for Jane? Make sure you're emotionally prepared to move forward and not use these relationships as a way to cope with your past.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's not necessarily a hard and fast rule to say \"no\" to dating Jane's sister and friend. However, it's crucial to approach the situation with sensitivity and honesty. If you do decide to ask one of them out, be open and transparent about your past with Jane, and be prepared to respect their boundaries and feelings.\n\nUltimately, prioritize being genuine and respectful in your interactions with Jane's sister and friend. If you're unsure about how they'll react, it might be wise to take a step back and focus on building a connection with someone else who doesn't have a pre-existing connection to your past.\n\nRemember, honesty and empathy are key in navigating these complex social situations. Take your time, and prioritize building meaningful connections with others while being mindful of the people involved."

You could ask him about his hobbies or passions outside of work, or suggest doing something related to the rink, like watching a hockey game or trying out a new activity. This way, you're showing genuine interest in getting to know him as a person, rather than just trying to get him to hang out.\n\nAs for being picky about what to do, you could try asking him specific, low-key questions like \"Hey, have you ever been to a [insert activity]?\" or \"I've been meaning to try [insert activity], have you done it before?\" This shows you're interested in his thoughts and experiences without putting too much pressure on the situation.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's okay if he says no or isn't interested in hanging out.

Making friends in a new environment can be intimidating, but with some preparation and a willingness to step out of your comfort zone, you can definitely become more outgoing and build strong connections. Here are some tips to help you make friends and become more confident in social situations:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Before arriving on campus, join online communities, forums, or social media groups related to your college or interests. This will give you a sense of what to expect and help you connect with people who share similar passions.\n2. **Be intentional about attending events**: Show up to campus events, club meetings, and activities that align with your interests. This will increase your chances of meeting like-minded people and starting conversations.\n3. **Start small**: Don't try to tackle everything at once. Begin with small, low-stakes interactions, like saying hello to your roommate or chatting with a classmate during a study group. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually move on to more significant conversations.\n4. **Find your 'why':** Identify what motivates you to make friends and be outgoing. Is it to have a study buddy, join a specific club, or simply to broaden your social circle? Knowing your 'why' will help you stay focused and motivated.\n5. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with others, focus on listening more than talking. Ask open-ended questions, show genuine interest in their experiences, and avoid interrupting. This will help you build rapport and create meaningful connections.\n6. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in building strong relationships. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People are more likely to be drawn to someone who is genuine and confident in their own skin.\n7. **Take small steps outside your comfort zone**: Challenge yourself to do something new each day, like striking up a conversation with a stranger or joining a new club. As you become more comfortable, you'll find that your confidence grows.\n8. **Be patient**: Building friendships takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on building meaningful connections with a few people rather than trying to accumulate a large number of acquaintances.\n9. **Seek out mentorship**: Find someone who embodies the qualities you admire and ask for their advice on how to navigate social situations. They can offer valuable insights and help you build confidence.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small achievements, like having a successful conversation or attending a new event. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue pushing outside your comfort zone.\n\nRemember, becoming more outgoing and making friends is a process that takes time and effort. Focus on building meaningful connections, being genuine, and taking small steps outside your comfort zone. With time and practice, you'll become more confident and develop strong relationships that will last a lifetime."

His excuse for that was he lost his  second pair of $200 headphones(he lost his first pair, now these) while he was at work and didn't want to call me because he didn't want to put his phone to his ear.

I'm here to help you break it down and offer some honest insights.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that he was busy, and I get that. However, as you pointed out, even when people are busy, they usually make an effort to check in with their partner. The fact that he didn't even send a quick \"Hey, I'm busy, I'll catch up with you later\" or a simple text to acknowledge your existence is concerning.\n\nRegarding the lost headphones excuse, it does seem like a bit of a stretch. I mean, who hasn't lost something at work before? It's not an uncommon experience, but it's how he handled it that's the issue. If he was genuinely struggling, it would've been nice if he'd reached out to you about it, even if just to say he was dealing with a stressful situation.\n\nThe comment about you being a \"boring texter\" is also a red flag. It sounds like he's making excuses to avoid communicating with you, and that's not okay. It's not your responsibility to entertain him or make sure he's having a good time in your conversations. You deserve to have meaningful and engaging interactions with your partner!\n\nGiven your concerns and the lack of effort he's shown, I think it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. You've been together for six months, and it's crucial to address these issues before they escalate.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to approach the conversation calmly and non-accusatorily. Let him know that you understand he was busy, but you felt neglected and unheard during that four-day period. Share your feelings and concerns about his communication style, and express your needs for more effort and attention. Be specific about what you need from him, such as regular check-ins or more meaningful conversations.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and mutual effort. If your boyfriend is unwilling to work on his communication skills or acknowledges your feelings, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve someone who prioritizes your feelings and makes an effort to connect with you regularly.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to have this conversation with your boyfriend, or do you need some more time to process your feelings?"

I'm happy to help you with some tips to keep the conversation flowing.\n\nFirstly, remember that it's okay to take a pause and collect your thoughts. It's better to take a moment to think than to force something out that might not be relevant or respectful. When you're feeling stuck, try to acknowledge the silence and use it as an opportunity to re-engage.\n\nHere's a simple trick: ask open-ended questions! Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves. This can be as simple as \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" or \"How was your weekend?\" Open-ended questions show that you're genuinely interested in the other person and can help to keep the conversation flowing.\n\nAnother tip is to find common ground. Try to find something you both have in common, whether it's a shared interest, a favorite hobby, or even a favorite TV show. This can be a great way to find a topic to discuss and can help to build a connection.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself! It's okay if you don't always come up with the most brilliant conversation topics. The goal is to be genuine and respectful, not to be witty or clever. Just be yourself, and the conversation will likely follow.\n\nI hope these tips help! Do you have any other questions or concerns about keeping conversations going?"

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's awesome that you're acknowledging this and wanting to work on it. Being aware of your energy and how it affects others is a huge step in self-improvement.\n\nFirstly, let's identify some potential triggers that might be causing your hyperness around friends. Is it:\n\n1. Excitement to see them? (Like, you're really happy to be socializing)\n2. Fear of being judged or not being \"fun\" enough?\n3. Desire to prove yourself or show off?\n4. Lack of boundaries or not feeling heard?\n\nOnce you pinpoint the root cause, you can start working on strategies to manage your energy. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Practice mindfulness**: Take a few deep breaths, notice your body's physical sensations, and acknowledge your emotions. This helps calm you down and gives you a moment to reassess the situation.\n2. **Set intentions**: Before meeting your friends, remind yourself of your goals for the hangout. Is it to have a chill conversation or to have fun? Focus on that intention and adjust your energy accordingly.\n3. **Use physical anchors**: Find a physical sensation that helps you calm down, like touching your wrist or doing a quick stretch. This can be a subtle reminder to tone down the hyperness.\n4. **Practice active listening**: Make an effort to truly listen to your friends, ask open-ended questions, and show genuine interest. This can help you stay present and focused, reducing the likelihood of getting hyper.\n5. **Take breaks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed or getting too energetic, excuse yourself for a minute to collect your thoughts. This can help you recharge and come back to the conversation with a more balanced energy.\n6. **Communicate with your friends**: Let them know that you're aware of your tendency to get hyper and that you're working on it. They might be more understanding and willing to help you find a balance.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be yourself, but it's also important to consider how your energy affects others. By being more mindful and intentional, you can find a balance that works for you and your friends."

It's okay to feel nervous, and it doesn't mean you're not prepared or capable. Now, let's get to some strategies to help you stay calm during tests:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: Make sure you're well-prepared for the test. Review your material, practice problems, and go over notes until you feel confident.

These can help calm your nervous system. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n3. **Positive self-talk**: Challenge those negative thoughts! Instead of \"I'm going to fail,\" tell yourself \"I've prepared well, and I can do this.\" Focus on your strengths and accomplishments.\n4. **Physical self-care**: Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a balanced diet. Taking care of your physical health can help reduce overall stress and anxiety.\n5. **Mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment. Instead of worrying about the future or past, bring your attention to your breath, your body, or the surroundings. Mindfulness apps like Headspace or Calm can help.\n6. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of viewing the test as a pass-or-fail situation, focus on the learning experience. Think of it as an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding and grow.\n7. **Take breaks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a few deep breaths, stand up, stretch, or do some quick exercises. This can help calm your nervous system.\n8. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor about your anxiety. They may offer valuable advice or just listen to you without judgment.\n9. **Reframe failure**: Remember that failure is a part of the learning process. It's not the end of the world, and you can always learn from your mistakes.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice relaxation techniques and mindfulness, the more they'll become second nature. Make it a habit to practice relaxation techniques regularly.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel some level of anxiety, but don't let it control you. By implementing these strategies, you can learn to manage your anxiety and perform better during tests.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything specific you'd like to try or any questions you have about these strategies?"

Which I don’t agree with but it’s something we don’t really talk about because we have many more non-political things we share in common, how this connects to my girlfriend is she is a semi openly biesexual girl, she hates my friend because of the things he has said before,  as of recently she’s asked for me to distance myself from him and stop being his friend.

None of my requests for middle ground are being heard. \nStill, I don't want to cause irremediable pain. He ex was a bad husband. I just need to find the words to talk to her without creating a huge argument.\n\n\nI ( M51) need advice calling off my. I don't wanna be hurtful. I just need the right words to say we will never get married and should break up permanently without destroying her self esteem.\n\nI fell in love with Maggy ( F52) after a very bad health scare. I was completely taken by her big/larger body type and her fun loving facial expression. I knew she had some self esteem issues that she dragged from her past marriage. So I've done my best to help her. However, she keeps raising the bar no matter what or how much I do for her. There's always something to piss her off, or worse, something that I didn't do. \n\nI'm very resentful. Her ex husband treated her like crap and she still tries to maintain his friendship. I've treated her like a princess and I'm not being appreciated. \n\nThings have changed so much that I'm repulsed by seeing naked and I can't help it. It started after she turned our home into a pigsty. I had to hire a cleaning lady because Maggy had atrocious habits, but I decided to hold back that expense and just do it ourselves.\n\nI come home at 2 am from the airport after two weeks of  traveling. I find that she lets our pets poo and pee on the floor and furniture, the kitchen is full of maggots and the kitchen sink was full of dirty water and dirty dishes. No toilet paper, food crumbs everywhere. Our bed had no fitted sheets. \n\nI had to start cleaning right that moment because we were supposed to have company that Saturday. After hours of cleaning, I had to cancel on our guests because the stench was prevalent and I needed to get a professional carpet/ furniture cleaner.\n\nShe never took responsibility. Instead, she blamed me. It was my fault, because I know she's not the cleaning type and didn't want to keep paying for a maid. I didn't feel good at all when she said with the money that I make, I could make her life easier. I've tried to work around her quirks. All I asked was that she respect what I already cleaned. I got to the laundry room and had to throw away an entire load. She put clothes in the washing machine, filled it up and forgot about them. The stink and mold ruined the garments. She said getting mad over it was me creating drama because new clothes could be purchased. I feel this is financially disrespectful. I've told her but she's not listening.\n\nI still did my best to keep each other happy. I took her on trips and had fun outings. We've been engaged for 8 months now, but her dirty habits are affecting my mental health. Whenever she turns our home into  a dirt hole, she says \"don't judge me\" but does nothing to help me feel more comfortable. It's come to a point where her selfishness has me feeling lonely.\n\nOur sex life has changed. I used to be very happy making sure she was satisfied. Until she took to critiquing my performance. She does climax, but likes to say things that make me insecure after the fact. For example, \"you didn't do this or that while xyz was happening\". I don't read minds. She could tell me while we are in the act. She says \"my relationship with my ex taught that blah blah blah blah blah\".\n\nMaggie likes to parade naked around the house. I initially thought it was sexy, until she refused to use a towel to protect the furniture, specially after sex when fluids are still running. \n\nI can't say anything because she accuses me of \"rejecting her\" . \n\nThe last time I had to do an emergency cleaning in the house, she was naked in the living room and it created such anger that I'm now repulsed. We can't invite anyone in. The place is always a mess. She's become an attention junkie and likes to either ridicule others or make jokes at the expense of others ( namely whoever is getting attention). We've talked about this many times. I think her friends gave her a lot of TLC during her divorce and she does not understand that the supply of attention isn't an endless one.\n\nHer best friend, Nora, is a very good person and has truly shown that she cares about us. I'm sure Maggie just ruined it.\n\nNora is married to Jake. We met via Nora. Jake and I have a very close friendship. \n\nWe attended their wedding and everything was great until we drove back home. Maggie criticized everything. After that, she hasn't really shown any enthusiasm to her friend. So Nora made an effort and came to visit. I offered the idea of an outdoors picnic because having visitors is very stressful. Nora surprised us with an amazing 4 huge trays of seafood boil. She even brought gloves and aprons. Instead of showing gratitude, Maggie took so many jabs at Nora that it began to look really unfriendly. I'm noticing things that are acts of spite.  The pain in Nora's face when she left, really, really made me question my relationship. If she does this to her best friend who helped her rain or shine, she will just run me over. \n\nMaggie and I had a huge argument because I said she needed to apologize. Furthermore, she ranted about Nora marrying Jake. He's very successful, he has money and he's very down to Earth. I don't live my life trying to assess people's wealth. Let him and Nora be happy and enjoy their lives. Maggy and I should be focusing on us. \n\nJake called me in such a state of anger that I put him on speaker. I'm not proud of this, but he told Maggie off for making Nora cry and I kind of enjoyed it. I apologized to him. After this, I got the silent treatment from her for not standing up to him. \n\nFor background, the jokes about Nora were about how she used to drive an old car that was ugly, how she got cheated and dumped by an ex and how she  begged that ex to take her back. There's no way I can appreciate humiliation. I've been there.  I keep asking Maggie if there's something I don't know about so that she's acting this way and she said that I need to stop. That's all in getting. \n\nI'm so put off and so pissed that I will not allow her to keep the ring. All of her philosophies now sound like toxic positivity. She advocates not getting angry and all that. \n\nI'm tempted but will definitely NOT go for cigarettes.\n\nAlso for background, she started acting out after we got engaged, although there were some red flags that I thought were temporary. \n\nEdit: so far there's an apartment I can rent but not inmediately available. It looks like I'll move with my nephew and his friends after I remove my stuff. I don't want to exit and  leave anything behind. If this turns out to be my most inmediate arrangement, my family will be taking in all my pets until I can move them with me. \n\nEdit: the movers had no availability due to short notice.

Before we dive into the conversation you need to have with Maggie, I want to acknowledge that you've been patient and understanding, but it's time to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nHere's a suggested approach for the conversation:\n\n1. Acknowledge the efforts you've made to help Maggie and express your concerns: Start by acknowledging the good times and efforts you've put into the relationship. Then, express your concerns about the recent developments, focusing on specific behaviors that are causing you distress, such as the state of your home, her criticism, and her lack of empathy.\n\nExample: \"Hey Maggie, I want to talk to you about us. I've been thinking a lot about our relationship, and I feel like we're not on the same page. I've been trying to make this work, but I'm feeling really overwhelmed and unhappy lately. I think it's because of the state of our home, and how you're not respecting my boundaries. I feel like you're not making an effort to change, and it's affecting my mental health.\"\n\n2. Be specific about what you need: Clearly state what you need from Maggie in terms of changes she can make to improve the relationship. Be specific about what you're willing and not willing to tolerate.\n\nExample: \"I need you to take responsibility for your actions and start cleaning up after yourself. I need you to respect my boundaries and not make jokes about others behind their backs. I need you to be more empathetic and understanding towards me and others.\"\n\n3. Avoid blaming or attacking language: Phrases like \"you're always\" or \"you never\" can come across as accusatory and defensive. Instead, focus on your own feelings and experiences.\n\nExample: \"I feel frustrated when I come home to a dirty house. I feel hurt when you make jokes about others behind their backs. I feel disrespected when you don't listen to me.\"\n\n4. Be prepared for resistance: Maggie may resist or become defensive when you bring up these concerns. Stay calm, empathetic, and firm in your stance. Remember that you're not trying to \"win\" an argument, but rather have an honest conversation.\n\n5. Be prepared to set boundaries: If Maggie is unwilling to make changes, it may be necessary to set boundaries or take steps towards separation. Remember that you can't change someone else's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it.\n\nRemember, your well-being is important, and it's okay to prioritize yourself in this situation. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it."

It's not easy to admit when you need space or a change, especially when it means confronting the uncertainty of a potential breakup.\n\nNow, regarding your question: is this the end or is this a healthy step for your relationship? Honestly, it's a bit of both.\n\nOn one hand, living apart can be a great opportunity for you both to recharge, reflect on your priorities, and gain some perspective on what you want from your relationship. It can also give you the space to focus on yourself and your own goals, which is essential for personal growth.\n\nOn the other hand, living apart can also create distance and make it harder to maintain intimacy and connection. You'll need to make a conscious effort to nurture your relationship and communication, which can be challenging, especially if you're not used to it.\n\nIt's also important to consider the underlying issues that led to the tension and fights in your relationship. If the root causes aren't addressed, the problems may persist, even if you're living apart.\n\nUltimately, whether this is the end or not depends on your partner's willingness to work on himself and the relationship. If he's genuinely committed to growing and changing, and you're both willing to put in the effort, living apart can be a healthy step towards a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.\n\nHowever, if he's not willing to acknowledge his own flaws or make changes, it may be a sign that the relationship has run its course. You deserve someone who respects and supports your needs, and if that's not happening, it might be time to reevaluate.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time, focus on yourself, and explore what you want from your relationship. You've already taken a huge step by acknowledging your needs and getting your own place – now it's time to prioritize your own happiness and well-being."

So I called UPS within like 20 minutes of supposed delivery, I was nice but upset and told them I really didn’t get it, which was true.

By keeping the truth that you didn't have the package initially, you're creating a potential discrepancy between what you initially reported and what actually happened.\n\nUPS has a process in place to handle lost or misplaced packages, and it's possible that they may try to contact the neighbor to clarify what happened. If they do, it's likely that the neighbor will reveal that you picked up the package, which could raise suspicions.\n\nIn this case, I would advise against continuing to push the initial claim that you didn't receive the package. Instead, I would suggest being honest with UPS and Amazon about what actually happened. You can explain that you initially reported the package missing, but later found it at a neighbor's doorstep. Be prepared to provide the neighbor's contact information and a brief explanation of what happened.\n\nIt's possible that UPS and Amazon will still be willing to work with you to resolve the issue, especially since you've been a good customer with no previous issues. However, by being honest and transparent, you'll be able to maintain a positive relationship with both companies and avoid any potential legal or ethical issues.\n\nRemember, honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to sensitive situations like this.

The thing is I always get so nervous before these things. I know theres no danger, and I usually don't even have to talk to anyone, but my social anxiety just seems to get the better of me. I'm especially nervous about leaving to basic training at the end of this month. How can I calm myself down? I excersise 3-4 times a week which has helped a lot but my anxiety is still really bad.",
    "human": "Try to recognize and catch yourself when you begin to think about these upcoming events.  You will catch yourself \"pre-planning\" for every possible scenario that may take place at these events.  Recognize that although running through all the scenarios of what may or may not happen at these events may feel helpful, but in reality it is not.  It serves no benefit to you.  Recognize that you have been in situations like the one coming up before, and you have survived.  Everything was okay after.  You have nothing to fear because the thing you are most afraid of has already happened to you.  Distract your mind from these fears and this anxiety.  Focus and become very aware of what is happening around you at this exact moment.  What do you smell?  What do you hear?  Drink a cold drink.  How cold is it?  What temperature exactly do you think it is?  \n\nSome of this stuff sounds silly, obvious, etc. but with practice you will find a lot of it is actually very helpful.  The way we think about things and our outlook on life, future events, and general worries is a skill like anything else.  It's weird to conceptualize *practicing* thinking in a more positive and beneficial way, but this stuff really does work.  Hope this helps at least a little bit for you.  Good luck.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's completely normal to feel anxious about new experiences, especially when it's something as significant as joining the military. It's great that you're aware of your anxiety and willing to work on it.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for exercising regularly - that's a great habit to have, and it's awesome that you've seen some improvement. Now, let's build on that foundation. Here are a few strategies that might help you manage your anxiety:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: Sometimes, our brains get anxious because we feel uncertain or unprepared. Since you have meetings coming up, try to gather as much information as you can about what to expect. Research the presentations, read up on the topics that will be covered, and even practice some relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. The more you know, the less room there is for anxiety to creep in.\n2. **Focus on the present moment**: When you start to feel anxious, try to bring your attention back to the present moment. Instead of worrying about the future (e.g., basic training) or replaying past anxious moments in your head, focus on your breath, your body, or your surroundings. Mindfulness can be a powerful tool in calming your nerves.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge those negative thoughts that come up. When you catch yourself thinking, \"I'm going to mess up\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" stop and reframe it. Tell yourself, \"I've prepared well, and I'll do my best. I can handle whatever comes my way.\" This can help shift your mindset and reduce anxiety.\n4. **Visualize success**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself handling the meetings and presentations with confidence. See yourself feeling calm, focused, and prepared. Visualize the positive outcomes you want to achieve. This can help boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.\n5. **Talk to someone**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend, family member, or even a mental health professional. Sometimes just talking through your anxiety with someone who understands can help you feel more grounded and less anxious.\n6. **Practice relaxation techniques**: In addition to deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, you might find other techniques helpful, such as visualization, yoga, or meditation. Experiment to find what works best for you.\n7. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks when you need them. When you're physically healthy, it's easier to manage anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's okay to take your time to work through it. You're taking a big step by joining the military, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. But with time, patience, and practice, you can learn to manage your anxiety and thrive in this new chapter of your life.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help. If your anxiety is severe or interfering with your daily life, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional support.\n\nYou got this!"

We always talk and think about how we want to spend our time in the future and I believe I would be happy except for one thing.... she doesn't want kids.\n\nI never thought that wouldn't be an option. I can't really decide if I want kids or not but she has been pretty adamant about not having them for a few years now. I've tried to think about not having them but the thought keeps coming back to my mind... what if I do want them and I end up wasting my (our) time? \n\nThe only conclusion I can think of is talking to her and making a decision based on that.

It's great that you're considering the potential consequences of not having kids, and it's understandable that you're torn between your desire for a family and your love for your partner.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for couples to have differing views on having children. It's a significant life decision that requires careful consideration.\n\nBefore having this conversation with your partner, take some time to reflect on your own feelings and priorities. Ask yourself:\n\n* What are your reasons for wanting kids? Is it a sense of duty, a desire for a biological connection, or something else?\n* Are there any specific fears or concerns that are driving your desire for kids?\n* Are you willing to compromise on this issue, or is it a non-negotiable for you?\n\nIt's essential to have this internal clarity before discussing it with your partner. This will help you approach the conversation with a clearer head and avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nWhen you do have the conversation with your partner, approach it with empathy and understanding. Avoid blaming or pressuring her for not wanting kids. Instead, focus on your own feelings and concerns. Be honest about your thoughts and fears, but also be open to listening to her perspective.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and growth. It's possible that you may not agree on having kids, but you can still build a fulfilling life together. Perhaps you can explore other ways to fulfill your desire for family, such as adopting or being a part of your partner's extended family.\n\nUltimately, the decision to end the relationship or work through this issue together is yours to make. But by taking the time to reflect on your own feelings and approach the conversation with empathy, you'll be better equipped to make a decision that aligns with your values and priorities."

First of all we had issues with the friends Christmas , he got upset we were hosting people (mostly his friends who have become mine) he stated that I made these plans without asking him. I told him how I came to him and stated that we should have a Christmas party what do you think about that? Which to me is asking. During this initial conversation he said the 23rd worked because his friend is coming into town who he hasn’t seen in years and he would like them to participate. We talked it over and it settled the issue , but considering this next piece I feel it’s important because overall he has been difficult during the holidays.  \nSo on to the next issue, Initially his family party was going to be on Christmas. But this morning he tells me that plans changed. So I said “oh are you coming to my moms Christmas then?” (He is a part of the gift exchange so I figured I should ask) he said “no I don’t want to, do you want me to go?” I said “of course I do but I don’t want you to come if you aren’t up for it.” Which is not a trap, I have told him time and time again that if he doesn’t want to go somewhere he should not come because whenever he feels obligated to go somewhere he doesn’t want to be he gets moody and it ruins the evening. He says he has 6 days off for the holidays and now it’s going to be shit because he has to spend 4 doing holiday plans. I tried talking to him and explained that I don’t want my family’s plans to be the reason he’s upset during the holiday season and that maybe he shouldn’t come if he feels that way. Also My family was the one who asked him to come not I, and I only asked about the 25th He was the one that added the 24th into the equation. He got mad at me and said he was just voicing his opinions but he won’t come for me but for my family because they invited him. But honestly I don’t want him to come if he doesn’t want to be there. It all seems too childish, just don’t come, of course I’d love to spend this time with you but not if you don’t wanna be there. I don’t know what else I can say, I feel like it’s worse then it started now.\n\nTL;DR \nMy boyfriend has been difficult about the holidays even after I have expressed my understanding of not participating in all the events. Been together for 6 year,  been living together for 2 and have 2 dogs.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: \nAfter being apart from each other all day and having space to think about how I feel and how he feels we were able to have another conversation. First of all thank you all for putting your input, even the input that put a microscope on me. It’s so important to understand that we are all human and make mistakes or say things that have consequence to others without intending them too. I talked with my partner again and really expressed how I want him to do what he feels is best for himself. As well as expressing how I want to understand how these family events drain him differently then they do me. A couple of you mentioned doing something different for the holidays next year and I will try this because it would be nice to do something one on one. After having this conversation with him he said okay and that he didn’t know what to say. Maybe he will have more to say when he has the time to process his emotions. I hope he will tell me what is best and how he feels if he needs or wants too. Any more advice is appreciated. Tho I feel I have done all I can.",

    "sentence": "overcoming the unthinkable?\n\nBackground: My wife and I have been married for 23 years and overall together for 28. Our mutual best friends of 22 years have been a major part of our lives so much that we're practically family. \n\nA few weeks ago we all went to Hawaii for one of our annual family vacations. My two eldest guys stayed behind for work so it was just myself, my wife, and my youngest son Caiden. Our best friends David Mayra, brought their youngest daughter Emma.\n\nEverything was going great on the vacation until Mayra and David got into one of their habitual spats whenever one of them look in the direction of someone if the opposite sex. We thought no biggie, they will work it out like they always do. They did eventually work things out but it took much longer than expected and made our day pretty uncomfortable due to the tension.\n\nA couple days later everyone was back to normal and we're all relaxing at the beach drinking some cocktails and the topic of jealousy came up. Mayra asked me if she thought she was a jealous person. I don't lie and have always been very direct so I told her yes, absolutely you and David are both extremely jealous people. \n\nI cited some examples such as, not being able to go to guys night or girls night only events, not being able to go to the restroom solo, constantly lookout through each other's phone. \n\nMayra seemed rather agitated at my reply but I assured her that it doesn't take away anything from them as a person. She seemed upset for about 15 minutes but then another conversation came up and all was well again.\n\nThe very next day, we had all planned on going to the other side of the island for snorkeling. As we were about to Leave, Mayra texted my wife and said they would be staying in. We figured they may be fighting again so we offered to take Emma with us so she can enjoy her day. They said not this time. We went on without them and had a great day. My wife Danelle, texted Mayra in the afternoon to check in and see if they were going to make the luau that night. Mayra texted back that they would meet us in the lobby.\n\nIn the lobby, Mayra said her and emma had bad stomach aches and that is why they stayed back. However during the party, David, Mayra, and Emma were very standoffish and not very talkative.\n\nWhen we get back to our hotel, Mayra pulls Danelle aside and tells her she needs to speak with her. I take Caiden up to our room and 5 minutes later my wife is calling me crying hysterically telling me to hurry up and come down and help her.\n\nI rush down as fast as I can only to find Mayra raging at my wife (her best friend) accusing her of cheating with her husband, David. The loo in her eyes was something I've never seen of her before. It's like she was possessed. Mayra was screaming she had proof of text messages exchanged but never provided us any data.\n\nMy wife and I are happily married and I didn't entertain those accusations for even a second. David also denied any such accusations and said there must be something else going on between the girls and they need to work it out and he was staying out of it.\n\nDanelle was obviously extremely hurt and shocked that her best friend can accuse her of something like this. She not only made these accusations with no proof but did this in our family vacation. Our son wept after seeing his Mom crying uncontrollably. We ended up cutting out vacation short a few days and came home.\n\nUpon our arrival home, Mayra had sent an email to Danelle saying she was at peace with what transpired in Hawaii along with dates and timestamps of text message exchanges between her and David. No proof of the messages or the content we're provided. Danelle and her went back and forth with Danelle denying all accusations.\n\nEventually Danelle pulled her ATT records and highlighted the dates/times Mayra listed and showed her that no messages or data (incoming/outgoing) was present for those dates and times. \n\nWe figure that either she is batshit crazy or David was having an affair and using Danelles name as a decoy. Either way, our phone records proved that it wasn't Danelle. \n\nIt's been 4 weeks and both myself and my wife have come to the realization that we are better off without the toxicity, however I'm having a really hard time moving on.\n\nAfter 22 years of friendship, we obviously have other friends in common. My wife has already had some of these friends defriend her after presumably hearing Mayra's insane version of her story or perhaps sometimes different.\n\nI want to put out every text, email, phone records, etc until a PDF and publish that shit for the entire world to see how insane she really is z however my wife just wants to move on.\n\nTLDR: My wife's best friend of 22 years accused her of cheating with her husband with no proof.\n\n\nGuess I'm looking for some advice on what to do?",

His brother (40 something)  recently moved there with his wife and two small kids. \nI (21) never had the opportunity to meet his brother but from what he told me, I don’t think I like him he seems like a slime ball because he goes behind his wife’s back and likes to go to strip clubs and I’m pretty sure he pays them for sex too he has done it before. \n\nMy boyfriend and I broke up once last summer we were apart for four months but have been back together since October and everything is going fine. He shared with me that once in the summer when his brother came to our city to visit he and his brother went to a strip club and then his brother paid a stripper to sleep with my boyfriend in I guess one of those private rooms.

I’m just nervous that his brother is going to party and do shady stuff like that. I’m also worried he’s going to smoke pot because he knows I hate that but I’m not there so it’s a perfect shady opportunity.

You have every right to be concerned about your relationship and your own boundaries. It's not about dictating what your boyfriend can or cannot do, but rather about being aware of the potential risks and taking steps to protect yourself.\n\nSince you've already discussed your boundaries with your boyfriend, it's essential to trust that he knows where you stand on these issues.

You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I know you're going to be staying with your brother in Vancouver, and I'm feeling a bit anxious about it. Given what happened in the past, I'm worried that he might try to influence you or tempt you to do something that makes you uncomfortable.

What you can do is focus on your own reactions and responses to the situation. If you do find out that your boyfriend has done something that makes you uncomfortable, it's crucial to address the issue with him in a calm and respectful manner, rather than jumping to conclusions or assumptions.\n\nRemember, communication, trust, and respect are key in any relationship.

You can't control how she feels about herself, but you can control how you respond to her. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Set boundaries: When your sister starts comparing herself to you or saying negative things about herself, it's okay to say, \"I understand you're struggling with self-doubt, but I'd rather not talk about this right now. Let's focus on something else.\" This sets a boundary and shows you're not comfortable engaging in conversations that make you feel bad.\n2. Avoid comparisons: When your sister makes a comment about your appearance, try not to respond with a comparison. Instead, say, \"I appreciate your kind words, but I think everyone is beautiful in their own way. Let's focus on what makes us unique and special.\" This helps shift the focus away from comparisons and towards self-acceptance.\n3. Encourage self-reflection: Suggest that your sister explore why she feels the need to compare herself to you. Ask her if there's something specific that's bothering her, and listen actively. This might help her identify the root cause of her insecurities.\n4. Model self-acceptance: Show your sister that you're comfortable in your own skin by being kind to yourself and others. Share your own struggles and imperfections with her, and talk about what you're doing to work on self-acceptance. This can help her see that it's okay not to be perfect.\n5. Seek professional help: If your sister's self-doubt is severe and impacting her daily life, consider suggesting that she see a therapist. A professional can help her work through these issues in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nRemember, you can't change your sister's insecurities overnight, but you can control how you respond to them. By setting boundaries, avoiding comparisons, encouraging self-reflection, modeling self-acceptance, and seeking professional help when needed, you can help your sister work through these issues and develop a more positive relationship with herself.\n\nAs for your books about anxiety and confidence, they're a great starting point, but it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your sister about her feelings and insecurities."

Show genuine interest: Ask follow-up questions and listen actively. This will help you build a connection and show that you're genuinely interested in getting to know her.\n3. Keep it brief: Don't dominate the conversation or talk too much about yourself. Leave space for her to share her thoughts and experiences.\n\n**When talking to her when she's with someone else:**\n\n1. Be mindful of boundaries: Respect her relationships with others and don't try to insert yourself into conversations that don't involve you.\n2. Wait for an opening: If you see an opportunity to join the conversation, wait for a natural pause or a moment when the group is wrapping up.\n3. Be friendly and courteous: Smile, say hello, and ask a brief question or comment. Keep it light and don't try to hijack the conversation.\n\n**Tips to avoid looking creepy:**\n\n1. Don't stare: Avoid making prolonged eye contact or staring at her. Instead, focus on the conversation and the people around you.\n2. Be yourself: Authenticity is key. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have.\n3. Respect her boundaries: If she seems uninterested or uncomfortable, back off and give her space. Don't push the issue or try to force a connection.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. Be patient: Building a friendship takes time. Don't expect it to happen overnight.\n2. Follow up: If you hit it off, make sure to follow up with her and continue the conversation.\n3. Be open-minded: Be willing to learn about her interests, values, and perspectives. This will help you build a stronger connection and a more meaningful friendship.\n\nRemember, the key to becoming friends with someone is to be genuine, respectful, and patient. Focus on building a connection based on shared interests and values, and don't try to force it. Good luck!"

    "sentence": "Dating your intellectual equal. I know that there are better subs for this, but I've always had great advice come from my smart friends here in LPT. Also it's really long, but I would **really** appreciate it if you would read the whole thing and give me your opinions and examples. Please no belligerence. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for just over two years now and are very serious about each other. Only recently I've been having some troubling thoughts about our compatability as partners. I love her more than I've ever loved another human in my life and I truly want things to work between us, but I continue to put off things like an engagement. proposal or moving in together I remind myself that even though the good times are great, the bad times are *really* bad. \n\nFor starters I feel like my girlfriend is not on my level intellectually. I enjoy spending my free time doing research about things that pique my interest or have sat on my mind for a while, while she would rather talk about how rude her co workers are or how shes afraid that certain people don't like her. I constantly find myself using longer sentences full of filler words in place of the ones I'd like to use, simply to avoid her not understanding and then getting upset at what she *thinks* I've said. In almost all cases she can't see what's just or socially correct. because she's more concerned about getting what she wants, which leads me to my next point. \n\nI don't feel like my girlfriend is my emotional equal. I feel very much more mature than she is a lot of the time. She thinks she's doing the right thing when she's really doing more harm. She believes herself to be ready for lots of adult things that I don't believe she has really studies or prepared for (She's only 19 years old and I'm 21, and while I won't pretend to know everything, she will.) Things like marriage or making major purchases. I mean for fucks sake this girl literally almost bought a dog because she *thought* we would have an apartment together soon and that I'd simply be okay with getting a dog. She's not diagnosed ADD but she shows a lot of signs so I wouldn't be surprised. She's intolerably stubborn, she ends all arguments with \"because I said so\" or,  \"just shut up\" because she cannot admit shes wrong. \n\nI love her for a lot of reasons and if possible I would love to help her see things in the ways that I know come from more logic and reasoning than she uses, but am I lying to myself when I think she can truly change? In my own research of this problem I came across an article that said that love is about bridging the gaps between you and your partner, and that a lot of people just find intellectual fulfillment from their peers while accepting fulfillment that your partner can offer. Am I wrong for wanting her to \"get on my level\" (Don't take that too literally.) \n\nGod I wish I could have said this in fewer words. \n\nTl:Dr I'm afraid my SO is *too* far beneath me in some ways to be happy marrying her.",
    "human": "Seriously dude, at 21 you're still basically an infant.  Don't get married now.  If you're lucky you'll grow out of this phase and look back on it with embarrassment and regret and maybe be a suitable marriage partner for someone.  Give it like 10 years, you've got a lot of growing up to do.\n\nThat's my Life Pro Tip: you should DEFINITELY not marry this girl, but probably not for the reasons you think.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, thank you for sharing your concerns and thoughts with me. It's clear that you're deeply invested in your relationship and are struggling with some significant issues. I'll do my best to provide a thoughtful and nuanced response.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your concerns are valid. You're not alone in feeling like your partner isn't on the same intellectual wavelength as you, and it's natural to want someone who can engage in meaningful conversations and share your passions.\n\nRegarding the intellectual disparity, it's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it can be a significant issue in the long run. If you find yourself constantly having to dumb down your conversations or feel like you're not being understood, it can lead to feelings of frustration and disconnection.\n\nAs for your girlfriend's emotional immaturity, it's concerning that she's not taking the time to reflect on her actions and consider the impact they have on others. Her impulsive decisions and lack of self-awareness can be challenging for you, especially since you're more mature and logical.\n\nThe question is, can she grow and change? It's possible, but it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. However, it's also crucial to be realistic about the likelihood of significant changes. If you're not confident that she's willing to work on herself and adapt to your needs, it may be a sign that you're not compatible in the long run.\n\nThe article you mentioned is relevant, and it's true that love is often about bridging gaps and accepting each other's differences. However, it's also important to recognize that you have a right to pursue a relationship that is fulfilling and challenging for you. If you feel like you're constantly having to compromise on intellectual and emotional levels, it may be a sign that you're not getting the kind of relationship you need.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to prioritize your own needs and well-being. If you're not feeling fulfilled and happy in the relationship, it may be time to re-evaluate whether it's the right fit for you. It's not about being \"better\" than your girlfriend; it's about being honest with yourself about what you need and want in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of what you can do next, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. Be specific about the issues you're facing and how they're affecting you. It's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, but also be clear about your expectations and needs. If she's unwilling to work on herself and adapt to your needs, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship.\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You deserve to be in a relationship that challenges and fulfills you, and it's not selfish to acknowledge that."

    "sentence": "How to not flinch I am a big flincher, even when I know there is no reason to flinch. Sometimes I'll flinch even when someone goes to give me a high five. Is there any way to keep myself from flinching like an idiot?",
    "human": "There's two ways of dealing with this, largely; there's moving your natural response from flinching to another unconscious response, such as stepping back, shifting your weight onto your back foot such as /u/Rhenthalin recommended, in which cr",
    "base_reply": "The old flinch reflex! It's more common than you think, and it's great that you're aware of it. Flinching can be embarrassing, especially when it's unwarranted. Here's the thing: it's not about being an idiot; it's about your nervous system's automatic response to perceived threats. So, let's work on rewiring that response.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that your brain is just doing its job – it's trying to protect you from potential harm. Now, let's retrain it to be less reactive.\n\n1. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises to increase your self-awareness. This will help you recognize the physical sensations that precede the flinch (tension in your shoulders, a slight jumpiness). When you feel that sensation, take a deep breath and calmly tell yourself, \"Ah, my body is just being cautious.\"\n2. **Desensitize yourself**: Gradually expose yourself to the things that trigger your flinch (like someone approaching with a high five). Start with small, low-stakes situations and work your way up. The goal is to become comfortable with the sensation of someone approaching or touching you without the need to flinch.\n3. **Relaxation techniques**: Practice relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or yoga to reduce overall tension in your body. This will help your nervous system become less reactive.\n4. **Reframe your thinking**: When you feel the urge to flinch, remind yourself that the situation is not a threat. Repeat a calming phrase, like \"It's okay, it's just a high five\" or \"This is a harmless gesture.\"\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself when you do flinch. Acknowledge the feeling, and gently remind yourself that it's just a habit. Don't beat yourself up over it – instead, focus on the progress you're making.\n6. **Physical exercises**: Engage in physical activities that challenge your balance and coordination, like tai chi or balance exercises. This can help improve your overall proprioception (your sense of body awareness) and reduce the likelihood of flinching.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't expect immediate results. With consistent practice and self-awareness, you can learn to reduce your flinching and become more confident in your reactions."

But, I'm here to tell you that meeting new people in a new city is definitely possible and can be a fantastic way to build a new network and community. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Join online groups and forums**: Look for Facebook groups, Meetup.com, or Reddit forums related to your interests, hobbies, or profession. This way, you can connect with people who share similar passions before even setting foot in the city.\n2. **Attend events and meetups**: Find events, conferences, or meetups related to your interests and attend them.

    "sentence": "\\####\n\nUPDATE 1: I have had another talk with my girlfriend after things settled from last nights discussion. Like some of you suggested, emotions ran quite high. I have been able to use your advise to better map the problem we're facing. \n\nIt seems clear now that the issue is indeed that she dislikes her (solo) life when I am not around and she tries to escape it by keeping herself busy when I am away. She does not have another person she can confide in like she can with me. I have told her that it is obvious that I am the persons she likes to get emotional support from but that it is not a task for me to bear alone. I've made it clear that it is too much burden to carry for a single person and that she should not be dependent solely on me. \n\nWhen I confronted her with the fact that I should be a nice extra on top of an already happy live, she told me that indeed she did not feel good when she is alone. We've established that the problem is not me being away, but her being alone. Right now I am just happy I have said what I wanted to say, she was happy about me being honest with her. She understands that it is not healthy to be emotionally depended on me alone but at the same time is scared because I told her it's not a burden I can carry. I think it all boils down to her having to find her own person within the relationship, and learning to deal with her self in different situations including ones where I am not around.   \nI really want to thank you for your responses so far, if there's any update I will post it here.\n\n\\####\n\nRecently me and my girlfriend of 2 years (living together for \\~1 year) have had quite a lot of arguments around the fact that I like to go on vacations with friends. My girlfriend and I have a really good and trusting relationship, we talk a lot about almost everything with each other and we both don't back away from 'hard' talks. We've had issues in the past, but we mostly come to a good in between solution on them and move on. But this one, we can't seem to crack.\n\nSome context: Friends always have been very important to me. I have quite a lot of them, split up between different groups. When I have had issues with previous relationships or other 'life problems' I could always rely on my friends to catch me when something goes sideways. For my girlfriend this is different, she has only about 2-3 real friends, and really only one she can confide in when somethings up. She mostly goes to her parents for those kinds of situations but says even they don't quite understand her or only come up with solutions instead of just listening. Furthermore, she's an only child and I have an older brother and younger sister who I love to hang out with. We've had a long talk yesterday resulting in her admitting that she thinks the only one who really 'sees' her and listens to her is me. Which, I can imagine, can be frustrating at times.\n\nNow a few months ago the topic came up that 2 of my friends (she's met before) would like to go on a surfing trip together for 2 weeks end of June. Meanwhile my girlfriend and I had already planned a holiday of three weeks in August. When I brought the surfing trip up, she got very emotional and couldn't understand why I'd want to spend so much time without her. Her being at home with nothing to do essentially while I am away having a fun time with friends, it seemed to sting her quite a bit. We've had a discussion which lasted till late at night, I understood her viewpoint and for her it's obviously not really a fun situation for me to be away for so long, and her being home alone struggling to fill the time. So I think I made a reasonable concession by cutting the trip to one week and at the time she seemed fine with this decision. She felt one week wouldn't be so bad, and we left it at that.\n\nNow the trip is in about a month and since I have been invited to a few other events of which 2 also happen in June before the trip. Nothing big, just a day of card gaming with friends and a concert with a mate of mine. Mentioning the latter yesterday seemed to trigger my GF to think about all the times I will be away.Now I know that she doesn't like it when I bring up events which she is not a part of, so I do feel a little bad when I do so. (Also I have had a pretty toxic relationship before in which I could not plan anything without my ex getting angry, so I always feel some resistance bringing stuff like this up). We both know she's working on the fact that she doesn't like when I am away, sometimes even a night I planned with mates seems too much for her, but other nights she's fine. But she says she thinks there are a few limits she really struggles with. Me being away for more than a day at a time is one of them she just can't wrap her head around. For her it's a fait accompli slowly creeping toward her, nothing she can do about it.\n\nThe problem seems to be part jealousy and part FOMO. She says she doesn't  like it when I do all those things with friends because she'd rather I do them with her and that she really wants to be happy for me when away, but can't 'feel' it like I can the other way around. Furthermore she hates being home alone having nothing to do. We've found out that if she's distracted with other stuff, it's easier for her to be alone. For instance when she has a busy school week when I am away, she just focusses on that. But if she has the week off while I am away, she struggles way more to keep herself busy.\n\nNow we're really looking for a way to deal with this problem. To us it doesn't seem like an issue to be breaking up over, because the rest of the relationship seems to work fine. Your average Wednesday so to speak is wonderful and nothing to be upset about. So we're looking for a way we can both be happy while I am away, me not thinking about her feeling miserable when I'm gone, and her feeling okay while I'm from home. I don't have the need to be away for more than a week each year, but I'd like for it to be something I can keep doing.\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend feels miserable when I am away from home for longer than a few days at a time while doing fun stuff without her being present. We've talked about it a lot but don't seem to be able to come up with a solution that suits us both.",
    "human": "I’ve been your girlfriend. The issue is just that she needs friends. You can’t be her only outlet to do things out of the house and to have fun. She should be able to occupy her time and herself while you’re gone. The problem is she can’t. So you’re out having a blast and shes just sitting at home waiting for you to come back probably jealous and wishing you were there so she’s not bored. From her end it sucks. But at the same time you’re doing nothing wrong! You’re allowed to go out with your friends and have fun without her! She really needs to work on expanding her circle and finding ways to take up her time without you. In the long run this will kill your relationship if she doesn’t. And its just not healthy for her. You will also get burnt out being the only one she feels a connection with etc. you cannot be everything to her. Your her boyfriend. That’s the role you fill. She needs to find other people to fill the other roles and stop relying on you so much. And until then realizing that it’s hard and her being upset you’re away is a her problem she needs to work on can help a lot. When I first started realizing it instead of bugging my SO or waiting around for him I’d watch movies he doesn’t like. Or blast music. Take a me day with a bath and wine and snacks etc. I came to love some of the alone time and ended up diving back into hobbies/interest I had lost because they weren’t things we could do together. Taking the time to entertain myself helped a lot. Now I don’t feel resentful when my SO goes out and I’ve started doing things on my own he doesn’t like instead of being sad he’s having fun when I’m not. Still working on the more friends thing, but that takes time and can be hard.",

It's great that you're taking the time to understand each other's perspectives and feelings.\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend's struggles are rooted in her own insecurities and feelings of loneliness when you're away. It's not just about you being away, but about her not having someone else to confide in or share experiences with. You're right that it's not healthy for her to be emotionally dependent on you alone, and it's great that you're encouraging her to find her own connections and interests.\n\nIn terms of dealing with her feelings of FOMO and jealousy, it might be helpful for her to focus on building her own social connections and interests outside of your relationship. This could be as simple as joining a hobby group, taking a class, or volunteering. This will give her a sense of purpose and fulfillment when you're away, and also provide her with a support network.\n\nIt's also important for you to prioritize your own needs and desires, including your friendships and personal growth. You're not being selfish by wanting to spend time with friends or pursue your own interests - it's essential for your own well-being and can actually strengthen your relationship in the long run.\n\nIn terms of specific solutions, you could consider having open and honest conversations with your girlfriend about your plans and feelings. Let her know that you value your relationship and will always prioritize her, but that you also need time for yourself and your friends. You could also suggest that she join you on some of your friend outings or events, or that you plan a special activity together when you're apart.\n\nRemember that relationships are about compromise and finding common ground. It's okay if you can't always be together, but it's important to find ways to stay connected and maintain your individual identities. Keep communicating openly and honestly, and I'm sure you'll find a solution that works for both of you."

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Repeat back what you heard**: Try paraphrasing what the other person said, like: \"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying [insert what you think they said]?\" This shows you're actively listening and helps prevent miscommunication.\n2. **Use a clarifying phrase**: Instead of \"what?\", try using a phrase like \"Can you elaborate on that?\" or \"How did you mean that?\" This invites the speaker to provide more context or details without making them feel like you're not interested.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking a yes/no question, ask an open-ended question that encourages the speaker to provide more information.

She immediately knew what I wanted to talk about because my boyfriend went to them(2 brothers and their gfs) and told them about this. She assured me she will be completely truthful and honest about what she knows and I can confirm any details with everyone else on the vacation because she would want someone to do the same for her. She confirmed that they were broken up for a while before the vacation and his ex actually bought the plane ticket herself. The ex still wanted to come even though his immediate family didn't really want that since they broke up. They fought the whole time and each of them clung to other people on the vacation. She assured me I have nothing to worry about that trip because it was extremely awkward and sour between them. Everyone knew he was seeing someone else at the time but was unsure how serious things were.  Apparently, when he brought me home for Thanksgiving, he told everyone that he wanted to tell me himself but just wasn't ready because he was too scared of the outcome. She did mention that she and some others have been urging him to tell me ever since as things between us got more serious. She said he really cares about me but what he did was stupid, I have every right to be mad and she'd be very upset as well. I guess he has been pretty fucked up the last few days and voiced his worries to them that I might end things.\n\nI still don't understand why I had to find out myself. I haven't said anything to him since he confirmed it over text 3 days ago. I'm still very much in shock...he's the first guy I ever brought home. I plan to talk to him when I'm ready and more composed and it would take some time for me to make a decision afterwards. Right now half of my entire closet is still at his house, including some expensive jewelry.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Clarification: The instagram post was dated a year back. I just happened to see it a few days ago. The annual vacation is a big group of 20 people (aunts, uncles, cousins...etc, and their significant others). He was laying next to his ex, his brother's gf and his brother in the picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2021, I moved to another state for school. My boyfriend and I met on a dating site in July and we hit it off instantly. He just got out of a 4-year relationship in February and mine (1.5 year) ended in March. My ex and I were still friends when we broke up, we even made plans for him to come visit me in September from another state. At the time, I wasn't really looking for a relationship and made it clear to him during our first couple dates. He knew about the visit and was aware I was talking to other dudes beside him. We clicked so well, we started hanging out almost every other day since the day we met and he slept over at my apartment after every date. We quickly developed feelings for each other and I found myself losing interest in everyone else. After about 2 weeks, he expressed wanting to be exclusive but didn't want to rush me and that he had stopped talking to other girls a while ago. He also started getting mad and hating the idea of me still talking to other people and having my ex visiting me in September. He told me about an upcoming annual family vacation that he goes on every year in August, it's a week-long and said he didn't want to lose me while he's away. He also jokingly asked if I wanted to come (it's all paid for by his grandpa) a few times leading up to the vacation. The night before the vacation, we cuddled in bed and poured our hearts out to each other. We had been unofficially exclusive for a month. I told him I canceled on my ex and that he wasn't coming in September anymore. He was so happy.\n\nWhen he got back from vacation, he practically \"moved in\" with me. We lived together for 10 months and fell deeply in love. He said he's never met anyone he felt so strongly connected to. He asked me to come on this year's vacation with his family and I agreed. We talked about the future and made plans together. We drove up to his parents for Thanksgiving and Easter's in. I went to his relatives' parties and met his distant family, uncles, aunts, cousins...etc in for every holiday/occasion. He met my parents at my graduation in May. When my lease was over in June, I had planned to go back to my state and he would move back to his. He begged me to come live with him in but we ultimately agreed to do long-distance for a year, visiting each other every couple months and he'd move to my stateafter 1 year. After just a month apart, I flew to his state to surprise him for our 1 year anniversary. I ended up staying there for a month and went on vacation with his entire family in August.\n\nI just got back home a few days ago and saw an insta post from his brother's gf of last year vacation and he's laying next to his ex-girlfriend in the Caribbean. I was in disbelief. I had no doubt in my mind that it must've been a re-upload from a couple of years ago but after asking him about it he admitted that he was stuck bringing her because his parents had already bought her the tickets and the trip was paid for. He said they fought the whole time and he wasn't even hanging out with her, he knew he had to tell me this eventually and it was what he was scared of the whole time. I burst into tears. I feel such immense betrayal, deceived, hurt. I'm reminiscing on the timeline and what we got going on between us then and just couldn't understand how he was able to keep this from me for this long, after everything. When was he gonna tell me? Was he ever gonna tell me at all? We were already so closely connected when he left for the vacation, we confessed feelings to each other, I canceled my ex's visit, he said \"I miss you\" when he was away...\n\nI've been ignoring his calls and texts for a couple days now. I want to take some time to really process everything. I've cried so much and couldn't make up my mind if I should walk away or give him another chance. I fear that if I stay things would never be the same anymore, I'd be in constant doubt about everything. Just where and when do you begin to believe anything or trust him again? It sucks so bad because he's the first guy I've thought of as someone I could be married to. I feel like the future I've imagined just changed before my eyes. I'm an emotional mess right now and don't want my crass feelings to dictate the outcome of the decision I'm making. Please talk some sense into me.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend of 1 year went on vacation with his ex and his family last year while we were seriously seeing each other for 1 month at the time. I found out by accident through an instagram post 1 year later. He claimed they were still broken up and it was an unwanted situation (tickets and trip already paid for and not refundable).",
    "human": "He wasn’t “stuck” bringing her. The idea he spent 0 time with her is hard to believe. So she flew to the Caribbean and hung out with his family without him? She had her own room? She went out and spent time solo in whatever island they were on?\n\nI feel like he lied the first time and is now lying to you again once you found out.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt, betrayed, and confused. It's crucial to acknowledge that you're not overreacting; his actions are unacceptable, and you have every right to be upset.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this. Many people have been in similar situations, and it's not uncommon for partners to keep secrets or hide the truth. However, that doesn't make it right, and it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nGiven the situation, it's wise that you're taking time to process your emotions and reflect on the relationship. You've invested a lot in this relationship, and it's natural to feel uncertain about the future. Before making any decisions, consider the following:\n\n1. Acknowledge your feelings: Recognize that your emotions are valid, and it's okay to feel hurt, angry, and confused.\n2. Reflect on the relationship: Think about the moments leading up to this revelation. Were there any red flags or warning signs that you ignored or downplayed? Were there any instances where you felt uneasy or unsure about his behavior?\n3. Evaluate his actions: Consider his explanation about the vacation. Was he genuinely trying to protect you from the truth, or was he just trying to avoid an uncomfortable conversation? Did he make an effort to be honest with you about his past, or did he keep secrets from you?\n4. Consider your own values and boundaries: Think about what you're willing to tolerate in a relationship. Are there any non-negotiables for you, and did his actions cross those boundaries?\n5. Take your time: Don't rush into making a decision. Give yourself space to process your emotions, and consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.\n6. Re-evaluate your trust: Trust is built over time, and it's essential to re-evaluate whether you can trust him again. Have you been ignoring signs or dismissing his behaviors, or was this a one-time mistake?\n7. Consider the future: Think about the kind of relationship you want to have. Do you want to continue investing in someone who may not be willing to be fully honest with you? Are you willing to work through the issues and rebuild trust, or do you want to prioritize your own emotional well-being?\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect, honesty, and transparency in a relationship. Take your time, prioritize your own emotional well-being, and make a decision that aligns with your values and boundaries."

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're dealing with a big health issue. It can be really tough to navigate the challenges that come with it. Making a living without a full-time job can be stressful, but there are some viable options to consider.\n\nFirst, let's focus on what you're capable of doing, rather than what you can't do. What are your skills, hobbies, or interests that you're still able to engage in, even with your health issues? This could be anything from writing, designing, or teaching to pet-sitting, photography, or even crafting.\n\nNext, consider the following options:\n\n1. Freelancing: You can offer your skills on freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. This way, you can work on your own schedule and choose projects that fit your energy levels.\n2. Online tutoring or teaching: If you have expertise in a particular subject, you can offer online tutoring or teaching services. You can use platforms like TutorMe, Chegg, or VIPKid.\n3. Selling products online: You can sell handmade products, digital products, or even stock photos on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shutterstock.\n4. Renting out a room on Airbnb: If you have a spare room in your home, you can rent it out to travelers. This can be a relatively passive income stream.\n5. Creating and selling an online course: Share your knowledge and skills by creating an online course on platforms like Udemy, Teachable, or Skillshare.\n6. Affiliate marketing: Promote products or services of other companies and earn a commission for each sale made through your unique referral link.\n7. Dropshipping: Partner with a supplier to sell their products without holding any inventory. You can use platforms like Shopify or Oberlo to get started.\n\nRemember, these options might not make you rich, but they can help you earn a decent income while working on your own terms.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the importance of self-care and prioritizing your well-being. It's essential to balance your work and rest to avoid burnout. Consider setting realistic goals, taking breaks, and seeking support from loved ones or a healthcare professional if needed.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your journey to making a reasonable income without a full-time job. Remember to stay patient, flexible, and kind to yourself throughout the process."

    "sentence": "One Day Off I'm a guy in my early 20s, and the idea of working for someone in a 9-5 job is completely out of my scope, I want to open my own small business and grow it up, I'm really hustling to make something work for me.\n\nWith that said, I'm getting really exhausted and my energy is getting burned out because I'm working all day and sleeping 6-7 hours a day.\n\nI'm thinking about taking a day off every week, which I must not get near my PC or any other thing that relates to my work, but I can't convince myself to not take advantage of 10-15 hours every week, that's 40-60 hours per month not doing anything!!\n\nCan anyone give me some advice on how I can take a break and not feel guilty about the time I'm specifying for it? and what is the best way to take a break? everyday or every other day or every week?",
    "human": "If you want to own your own small business, start by taking some business school courses.  A good business startup has a solid business plan that allows for people getting sick and for days off for everyone in the business.  If you can’t do this, your business isn’t sustainable no matter how many hours you pour into it.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it, my friend! You're burning the candle at both ends, and it's no surprise you're feeling exhausted. Taking a break is essential, but I understand the struggle to disconnect from work.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing the need for a break. That's already a huge step forward. Now, let's tackle the guilt and find a way to make it work for you.\n\nTo start, I'd recommend setting a specific \"break day\" or \"digital detox day\" each week, where you completely disconnect from work-related activities. This could be every Sunday, every Wednesday, or any other day that suits you. Consistency is key, so choose a day that you can commit to.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of taking 10-15 hours off, start with a smaller chunk, like 4-6 hours. This will help you ease into the habit of taking breaks without feeling overwhelmed. You can use this time to relax, recharge, and do things that bring you joy, like reading, exercising, or spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo make it easier to stick to your break day, consider implementing a \"no-work\" rule. This means no checking work emails, taking work calls, or engaging in any work-related activities during your break time. Remember, this is about recharging, not checking in on work.\n\nNow, about the frequency of breaks: it ultimately depends on your personal schedule and needs. If you're someone who can handle a full day off every week, go for it! If that's not feasible, start with a half-day or a few hours off and adjust as needed.\n\nSome additional tips to help you disconnect and stay guilt-free:\n\n1. Set clear boundaries with clients and colleagues: Communicate your break schedule in advance and set expectations.\n2. Plan ahead: Schedule your break day in your calendar and treat it like any other non-negotiable appointment.\n3. Find alternative activities: Engage in hobbies, exercise, or relaxation techniques to keep your mind off work.\n4. Practice self-compassion: Remember that taking breaks is essential for your well-being and growth. Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to take time off.\n\nRemember, my friend, taking breaks is not a luxury; it's a necessity. By prioritizing your well-being and setting realistic boundaries, you'll be more productive, focused, and driven in the long run."

Until recently I was a stay at home mom with 2 kids 5f and 10month old. \n\nI will admit I sucked as a stay at home mom, The house was never filthy but not cover a magazine. The kids were happy and I was just surviving most days till 7pm when he walked in. \n\nRecently he’s started his own business but it’s yet to take off yet so I went back to work. He’s constantly criticizing me. He called me a slob to his friend which is ironic because he still doesn’t clean….\n\nA few nights ago after working and dinner i was tired and went to bed. I left a bowl with the grease in it to dump out in the morning because the trash was full and some spices. \nmy Husband decided to take a photo, still didn’t help me clean it. I did the next morning for what it’s worth. When I confronted him about the photos… He said it was “constructive criticism” I won’t lie. I lost it, He’s home 24/7 now and im still doing all the cleaning but he says he’s just trying to help me????\n\nso reddit am i really the asshole for not cleaning the kitchen? He knows i’m making this post because we have hit a dead end on this argument",
    "human": "You shouldn’t be doing everything and still working, that’s unfair. I would just tell him since he doesn’t like your cleaning then maybe you should leave it up to him to do all of the cleaning. He should clean the whole house every day and show you how it’s done since clearly he is the expert in cleaning. Lol",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and hurt.\n\nFirstly, let me tell you that you're not the asshole for not cleaning the kitchen. It's not reasonable to expect you to be perfect, especially when you're working and taking care of two young children. It's normal to have a messy kitchen now and then.\n\nWhat's concerning is your husband's behavior. Documenting your cleaning mistakes and calling it \"constructive criticism\" is not okay. It's passive-aggressive and controlling. By doing so, he's not helping you improve, but rather belittling and shaming you.\n\nHere's the thing: criticism is constructive when it's specific, respectful, and focused on behavior change, not personal attacks. Your husband's actions are not constructive; they're hurtful and undermining your self-esteem.\n\nIt's also important to note that your husband's criticism is not only hurtful but also unfair. He's not pulling his weight in the household, and instead of helping you with the cleaning, he's taking photos and criticizing you. That's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nI would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your husband about how his behavior is affecting you. You need to express your feelings and concerns, and set clear boundaries. You deserve respect and support in your relationship, not criticism and shame.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many women have been in similar situations, and it's not uncommon for men to use criticism as a way to control and manipulate. You deserve better, and it's time to stand up for yourself and your worth.\n\nPlease take care of yourself during this challenging time. Remember to prioritize your well-being and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed."

It just goes to show that it's always worth taking the time to check these websites periodically.\n\nI would recommend setting a reminder for yourself to check the website every 6-12 months to ensure you don't miss any potential claims. You can also check the website for your state's treasurer or revenue department as well, as they may have a similar database for unclaimed properties.\n\nRemember to also check with any old employers, banks, or financial institutions you've had accounts with in the past to see if there are any unclaimed funds or accounts that need to be closed or claimed. It's always better to be proactive and take control of your finances than to leave these funds sitting out there unclaimed."

Here's the thing: it's not uncommon for people with anxiety to use talking as a coping mechanism. It's like your brain is trying to fill the silence or distract you from the anxiety.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's not about being annoying or not. It's about your anxiety trying to take over. Now, here are a few strategies that might help you regain control:\n\n1. **Pause and take a deep breath**: When you start feeling like you're going to talk nonstop, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. This simple act can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to regroup.\n2. **Label your feelings**: Recognize that you're feeling anxious and that's why you're talking a lot. Acknowledge the feeling, and try to separate it from your thoughts. This can help you detach from the anxiety and respond more thoughtfully.\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness is all about being present in the moment. When you feel the urge to talk excessively, try to focus on your breath, your body, or your surroundings. This can help you stay grounded and centered.\n4. **Set boundaries**: It's okay to tell people, \"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need a moment to collect my thoughts.\" This can help you regain control and set boundaries for yourself.\n5. **Practice assertive communication**: When you do need to talk, try to be more intentional and focused. Use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings, and avoid rambling or dominating the conversation.\n\nRemember, it's a process to develop new habits and manage your anxiety. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. With time and practice, you can learn to manage your anxiety-induced talking and develop healthier communication habits."

    "sentence": "We’ve been together five years, lived together for three. When we met we had a number of shared interests as well as our own separate things. She had DnD which I’ve never been interested in, while I had local sports and classic literature which she couldn’t care less about.\n\nOver time that changed. She started coming with me to see live sport. She would ask me about the books I was reading. Within a year or so we would go to every event together and her collection of jerseys matched mine, and she would read any book I recommend and dissect it with me. It was wonderful. Both of us have always been solitary types, I’ve always pursued my hobbies alone and now I was able to share them with someone. And with the person I loved too!\n\nOver time that has changed. My girlfriend is far better at communicating with people than I am (thank you, sheltered religious upbringing and neurodiversity) and she started ingratiating herself into communities around our interests. She started contributing to local sports discussions and finding herself invited to social events, meeting the athletes, volunteering for community groups. Book discussions spilled into online communities, which became visiting signings and podcasts.\n\nToday she chairs the official fans’ trust of our local soccer team, and was granted access by the estate of my favourite author to go through his notes for the purposes of a documentary about him. I hate it. I hate all the busy-ness, all the people and back-patting and schmoozing. I don’t even want to go back to being just me and her going to games, discussing books until one in the morning. I just want to enjoy my hobbies by myself again.\n\nI’ve looked within over and over to try and work out why I feel this way. I’ve never been a gatekeeper, I only ever want to open doors and encourage people. I don’t think I’m a misogynist or a fragile man who resents successful women. My exes include a very influential businesswoman and professional gymnast while I’ve always had a boring mid-level office job, never had any problems with jealousy or resentment there. And yet I do find myself feeling jealous and resentful of my girlfriend. Perhaps it’s because these are “my” interests and I feel incapable of making any of the social strides she’s made. Perhaps I’ve made the “lone wolf” element of my fandom into more of my identity than I realised to compensate for that.\n\nThese are new feelings for me, they’ve crept up on me and I have no idea what to do about it. I feel especially guilty because I haven’t talked to her about it. We have always been able to have difficult conversations and understand that they need to happen sometimes. Yet I feel paralysed and unable to discuss this with her.\n\nAt the end of the year we’re going abroad for a convention about one of my favourite film series. I just want to mill around at my own pace, take it all in… and I just know that she’s going to schmooze her way into charming the actors and filmmakers I adore in a way that I simply cannot. Honestly, I wish I were going by myself and I feel terrible for that.\n\nI don’t know where to begin working any of this out and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. My girlfriend is a wonderful woman who has continued to adore me the entire time we’re together and would probably sacrifice all of her accomplishments to stay with me. I don’t feel worthy of that.\n\n**TL;DR: My girlfriend has slowly become an influential figure in the arenas around my hobbies. I am feeling resentful of this for reasons I am not sure of and wish I could go back to simpler times when it was just me and my interests.**",

But because you’re into the same stuff now, the clash in approaches is this constantly noticeable thing.  Something that makes you wonder if one of your approaches is “doing it wrong,” and then sends you tumbling down a thought-exercise rabbit-hole of trying to figure out who and why.  And bam, all the sudden your hobby feels more stressful than fun, even though you can’t really put a finger on why.  \n\nSo I would work on the thought-exercise of  “we approach things differently, and *both* are valid, and that’s ok.”\n\nAnd I’d also talk to your partner about how you prefer to hang back/be more casually involved in some events, and what it might look like for you two to happily coincide in those situations.

I think it's more nuanced than that. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of loss of control and identity. You've always defined yourself as a solitary person who pursues your interests alone, and now you're feeling like your girlfriend is encroaching on that space.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to feel this way when their partner becomes more confident and successful in areas they're passionate about. It's almost like you're experiencing a sense of \"impostor syndrome\" - you feel like you're not good enough or capable enough to keep up with your girlfriend's new level of involvement.\n\nI think it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It might be helpful to express your concerns and feelings in a non-accusatory way, focusing on your own emotions and experiences rather than attacking her or her accomplishments. You could try saying something like, \"Hey, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately.

Can we find ways to balance our interests and make time for just the two of us?\"\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your girlfriend's accomplishments are not a reflection of your worth as a person. You're not any less worthy of love and respect just because she's become more successful in her own interests. In fact, her success is likely a reflection of her own hard work and dedication, and that's something to be celebrated.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself and try not to beat yourself up over these feelings. It's okay to feel jealous and resentful - it's a normal part of the human experience. But by acknowledging and working through these emotions, you can come out stronger and more empathetic on the other side.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own needs and interests. You don't have to abandon your hobbies or interests just because your girlfriend is becoming more involved. Maybe you can find ways to compromise and balance your shared interests with your own solo pursuits. And who knows, you might even discover new ways to appreciate your girlfriend's passions and accomplishments."

    "sentence": "How do I translate my behind-a-screen conversational skills to in-person conversations? I've noticed that when I'm in a conversation with somebody irl, I never know what to say next. I'm constantly drawing blanks, and I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I get anxious and focus too much on *having to reply.* Over a screen, I have the opportunity to think about what I am going to say, and things usually go very well.  How do I become better socially in real life?",
    "human": "Practice. I'm sort of in the same boat as you as I get anxiety often and end up fumbling in conversations. Practicing is and gets very easy when you start with simple conversations, like when you are buying food from a takeout place. When practicing like this it's best to engage the person with an open ended question that could lead to a longer response. Rather than the, \"Hey, how is business doing?\" ... \"Good.\" type of conversation, you may want to start with something like, \"Hey, the food here is great, you guys must be doing well I hope?\" More often than not, showing a little bit of effort rather than the typical standard small talk phrases and questions, will provide you with enough information to go off of what they say.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It's great that you're aware of your strengths and weaknesses, and that you're looking to improve. Translating online conversational skills to in-person conversations requires some intentional practice and mindset shifts. Here are some tips to help you become more comfortable and confident in your in-person conversations:\n\n1. **Practice mindfulness**: When you're in-person, try to focus on the present moment and the conversation itself, rather than worrying about what to say next. Mindfulness can help you stay calm and centered. Take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that it's okay to pause or take a moment to collect your thoughts.\n2. **Listen actively**: In online conversations, you can type out your thoughts and take time to craft your response. In-person, focus on listening actively to the other person. Pay attention to what they're saying, ask clarifying questions, and show that you're engaged. This will help you stay engaged and build a stronger connection.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of worrying about what to say next, focus on asking open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more. This will help you stay engaged and give you something to respond to.\n4. **Embrace silence**: It's okay to pause or not have an immediate response. Silence is not the enemy! Use it as an opportunity to collect your thoughts or ask a follow-up question.\n5. **Prepare ahead of time**: While you can't prepare your exact words, you can prepare by thinking about common conversation topics or current events. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.\n6. **Start small**: Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Start with small, low-stakes conversations, like chatting with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually work your way up to more significant conversations.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become. Try to engage in conversations with people from different backgrounds and with different interests. This will help you develop your skills and build confidence.\n8. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes or not know what to say. Don't beat yourself up over it! Instead, focus on learning from the experience and moving forward.\n\nRemember, becoming more confident and comfortable in in-person conversations takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With time and effort, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your ability to engage in meaningful conversations."

They also said that they're \"trying to protect me\", and mom has deleted photos of me from her FaceBook including outfits of her in bathing suits\n\nI was recently able to make it to where I don't have to go every Sunday anymore after a lot of arguing for a long time, but my dad is running for a deacon position and the church is going to have a vote soon. The vote is happening on a weeknight for members where they will vote and announce who won after, and dad said they'll be serving food and having worship while they're counting. That's not for a few weeks though, and dad's been down my throat wanting me to delete my IG. But, I'm making this because other men at church have begun bugging dad about me too after they looked up my page, and I just feel disgusted by the whole thing\n\nI only have Instagram and Snap, but dad told me that some men talked to him and told him that some of the things on my page are \"inappropriate\", and I don't know why they were on my page or how they found it. Dad also pointed to a scripture that says \"you can't be a leader if you can't lead your own children\" when we talked, but I did nothing wrong. Some of the photos have been there for years. But, his friends told him that I should remove some photos where I'm wearing a bathing suit or an outfit from gymnastics because they're inappropriate despite them being there for years. They're just photos from meets or with awards or me training, but dad said that they can be \"taken out of context\" and hurt his chances of getting voted after they mentioned it, and mom has also deleted her bathing suit photos from her FaceBook including photos from my meets. She also said it'd be easier for me to just delete my page and start over with appropriate clothing, and she doesn't want me to just make my old page private either. I just feel weird that these men found my page and don't even know how they did or why they were on it at all.

So, not for my dad, but because I don't want them to have the link because even if I make it private, it'll show that the page is still up because they have the link, and I could easily just make a new account that's private with a new name that they'd never find. I just don't want to be around those men at church anymore*\n\n*Btw, the photos that the men complained about, were vacation photos that we had someone else take of us and photos from a gallery of a meet that I placed well in years ago, a meet that had a photographer photograph there and give us photos*",

Aside from the usual arguments that most couples have, everything is normal. The thing is, my dad does not approve of our relationship, I come from a well-off family, graduated from a prestigious university in our country and is currently taking up law, whilst him, on the other hand, only graduated high school because his family couldn’t send him off to college— which I do not have a problem with, some people aren’t as privileged and I understand, but he has also promised to start college as soon as he is financially capable. As of now, we are both working and he is the breadwinner of his family. \n\nNow here’s the problem, my dad has always told me that getting with people who are not economically at the same level as you is horrible, he married my mom (deceased) and eventually had to financially support her side of the family (parents, siblings, cousins), even after her death in 2019. I understand how frustrating that is and I’ve always told him how I know his (my bf) family and that I would know when it’s time to walk away if and when I feel that I’d experience the same thing. Recently, I’ve noticed how his side of the family would ask me for things, at first it seemed off as a joke, buy us this food, or maybe she could treat you to this place, nothing that I personally would have minded because I didn’t take them seriously. Until his cousin’s husband, whom he treated as a brother messaged me asking to borrow a significantly large amount of money, he (the cousin’s husband) kept bugging me about it and I always held off replying to him because I didn’t want to seem selfish, also because a.) he didn’t want me to tell anyone, b.) not even his wife knows that he was asking to borrow money from me, and c.) because he was just really sketchy about wanting the money immediately. When I did finally reply though, I ended up saying yes at first but after talking to friends, I realized that it probably wouldn’t be the best thing to do, so I backed out and he replied kind of manipulatively saying how I didn’t trust him or that I probably thought he wouldn’t pay. \n\nI feel like this probably wouldn’t be the last time that something like this would happen. I also found out that his family is finally encouraging him to go to uni because I’d be there to help him. I didn’t know if that “help” meant financially or with his academics. I’ve always been clear about how I want us to spend our money and how I don’t plan on using my financials for anyone other than my family.

However, it's also important to remember that your dad's opinions might be colored by his own experiences. His marriage and subsequent financial burdens might have led him to develop a skewed perspective on inter-class relationships.\n\nRegarding your boyfriend's family, it's understandable that you're worried about their expectations. The fact that his cousin's husband asked to borrow a significant amount of money from you without being upfront about it is concerning. It's not okay for anyone to manipulate or guilt-trip you into giving them money, especially when you've already expressed your boundaries.\n\nIt's also reasonable to be wary of the fact that his family is now encouraging him to attend university because you're there to \"help\" him. Without more context, it's hard to say what exactly they mean by \"help,\" but it's possible that they're relying on you to support him financially or academically.\n\nHere's what I want you to consider: you've been clear about your financial priorities and boundaries, and it's essential to stick to those. If you feel like his family is taking advantage of your generosity or that they're not respecting your financial autonomy, it's okay to re-evaluate the relationship.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns.

However, as someone who cares about him, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and not judgment.\n\nBefore you have a direct conversation with your brother, consider having an open-ended conversation with him about relationships in general.

A professional can help him develop coping strategies and provide a safe space to process his emotions.\n\nRemember that ultimately, it's your brother's decision whether to stay in the relationship or not.

You can't pour from an empty cup, so to speak.\n\nGiven your concerns about your brother's behavior, it's crucial to address the root issues before considering him moving in with you and your husband. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Have an open conversation with your dad**: It's essential to understand the situation and your dad's perspective. Ask him to explain the reasons behind his decision to sell the house and why he thinks your brother should move in with you. Be honest about your concerns and boundaries, but also listen to his point of view.\n2. **Set clear boundaries and expectations**: If your brother does move in with you, establish clear rules and expectations regarding responsibilities, rent, and contributions to household expenses. Make sure he understands that he'll need to take care of himself and contribute to the household.\n3. **Encourage accountability and responsibility**: Support your brother in finding a job, and help him develop a routine and accountability system. This could include regular check-ins, goal-setting, and consequences for not meeting expectations.\n4. **Seek professional help**: Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who specializes in working with young adults. They can help your brother address underlying issues, such as anger management, anxiety, or depression, which might be contributing to his behavior.\n5. **Prepare for the possibility of not being able to help**: It's essential to acknowledge that you can't fix your brother's problems or become his caregiver. Be prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing or able to change his behavior, and that you might need to set boundaries or limit your involvement.\n6. **Focus on your own self-care**: Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup. Make sure you're taking care of your own physical, emotional, and mental well-being during this challenging time.\n\nRemember, you can't change your brother's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. By setting clear boundaries, encouraging accountability, and seeking support, you can help him become a more responsible adult, even if it's not in your home."

    "sentence": "My boyfriend recently moved to a different country for a semester abroad and has been connecting with new people all the time. But at some point, I started realizing that he was giving very vague answers about who invited him to which party and who he was generally with. After asking for details and prodding over time only did I get information. So his first week there he suddenly brought up the topic of bias when meeting new people. He said that he doesn't want to do it, but unconsciously is only drawn to good-looking people. I didn't ask what brought about this thought but now think I should have. Because exactly in this week he met his current closest friend there, girl T. This information only came to light a few weeks after when he told me he was going for a birthday party and after asking whose birthday it was, he said he didn't know. Turns out, T invited him to a birthday party of someone she knew (he didn't even know if the person whose birthday party he was going to was a guy or a girl, just said yes to following T).\n\nAfter this, I decided to ask him to be honest with me with all his plans. And he admits to hiding the fact that it has mostly been with T that he was spending time. A week after meeting each other, they already planned a weekend trip together to a different city (but with two others as well). His reasoning for hiding the information was, that he didn't want to make me uncomfortable.\n\nAs for me, I had two exes cheat on me with their 'friends' while we were in a long-distance relationship. With the same MO, first, it was a group, then it was 'oh yeah she was there too', then it was 'oh yeah she's the one who invited me' , to 'after spending so much time together, it just happened'. So naturally, this is a very triggering situation for me.\n\nOn one hand, I do want him to make new friends and have fun, but the fact that he hid it so early in the start makes it superrrrrr difficult for me not to think about it and feel like shit every time they're out together, which is basically every other day, if not more frequent. But generally, they're rarely alone as far as he tells me.\n\nI understand his reasoning but I mean if you know you're partner is uncomfortable with it, why would you go ahead with it. But then on his side, if she's the only one inviting him places, he just maybe doesn't want to miss out on chances to meet new people? Generally, I do believe my boyfriend doesn't have bad intentions, that he's just that kind of person who's super friendly with everyone. So I do wish this feeling goes away, but the prior hiding is making it really difficult for me, due to the whole dejavu of the situation for me.\n\nI honestly don't know how to get rid of this terrible feeling that's constantly there or if this feeling is valid. I told him he should be more honest with me in the future but then hearing from him that she is always around him doesn't help either after knowing the initial hiding. How do I get over this or deal with this situation? Anyone with experience dealing with such a situation.\n\nTLDR: My (25f) Boyfriend (28m) doing a semester abroad and hid the fact that he was predominantly spending time with a specific girl (but usually with others present) because he says he didn't want to trigger any bad reaction for me (was cheated on by TWO exes with 'friends' during LDR). But in so caused me to overthink and make it difficult to trust him and is wrecking my ability to be normal with him. How do I deal with this situation?",
    "human": "\"Protecting you\" would be not doing the thing. Not lying about it.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that the past experiences with your exes have triggered feelings of unease and mistrust. It's great that you're acknowledging the complexity of the situation and wanting to work through it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your feelings are valid. It's natural to feel uneasy and worried when your partner is hiding information from you, especially given your past experiences. However, it's also crucial to separate your past traumas from the present situation.\n\nSince your boyfriend's intentions seem to be genuine, and he's not intentionally trying to hurt you, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings. Explain to him how his initial hiding made you feel and how it's affecting your trust in the relationship. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid blaming or accusing him.\n\nIt might be helpful to set some boundaries and expectations for your relationship during his semester abroad. You could discuss how you'd like him to keep you updated on his social life, including who he's spending time with and what activities he's doing. This will help you feel more included and connected to his life, even from a distance.\n\nIt's also important to focus on building trust and communication in your relationship. Encourage your boyfriend to be open and transparent with you about his plans and social life. You could also ask him to introduce you to his friends, including T, so you can get a better sense of the dynamics and people he's surrounding himself with.\n\nRegarding T specifically, it's natural to feel apprehensive about her being a central figure in his life. However, it's essential to remember that she's not the same as your exes. Try not to jump to conclusions or assume the worst. Instead, focus on getting to know her and building a connection with her yourself.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to prioritize self-care and self-reflection during this time. Acknowledge that it's okay to feel vulnerable and take time to process your emotions. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, communication, and trust. It's not about being perfect or having all the answers. It's about working together to build a strong and healthy connection."

    "sentence": "How to get over someone. Okay so I know this'll sound like stupid little kid drama but it's actually hindering my ability to properly enjoy my life. Okay, so I dated a girl back in 2012 all the way until the end of 2013. She broke up with me bc she \"no longer had feelings for me\" (I learned later she might've been cheating towards the end). It's been 3 years since then and my thoughts are still consumed by this girl who made me (at one point) the happiest I've ever been in my life. I can't date other people because she's all I think about and I can't go two seconds without her on my mind. I've gone to therapy (for this and other reasons) and it didn't help at all.

It's not uncommon for it to take time to process and move on from a significant relationship, especially one that was meaningful to you.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's not \"stupid little kid drama.\" It's a normal and valid human experience to feel deeply about someone. However, it's also important to recognize that dwelling on past relationships can prevent you from moving forward and enjoying your life.\n\nHere's a crucial thing to understand: you can't \"get over\" someone overnight. It's a process that requires patience, self-reflection, and intentional effort. I'm not going to give you a quick fix or a magic solution. Instead, I'll offer some strategies that might help you start to shift your focus and move forward:\n\n1. **Acknowledge your feelings**: Recognize that your emotions are valid, but also acknowledge that they're not necessarily a reflection of reality. You're not the same person you were in 2012, and your ex is likely not the same person either. It's okay to acknowledge the pain and sadness, but don't let it define you.\n2. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, exercise regularly, and prioritize sleep. This will help improve your mood and reduce stress.\n3. **Focus on the present**: Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on the present moment. Practice mindfulness meditation, gratitude journaling, or simply pay attention to your surroundings. This can help you stay grounded and centered.\n4. **Create distance**: Limit your exposure to things that remind you of your ex, such as social media, places you used to frequent, or mutual friends. This might be difficult, but it can help you start to disconnect from the past.\n5. **Explore new experiences**: Try new hobbies, take on new challenges, or travel to new places. This can help you discover new aspects of yourself and broaden your perspectives.\n6. **Reframe your thoughts**: Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive light. Instead of thinking \"I'll never find someone like her,\" try reframing it to \"I'm worthy of love and connection, and I'll find someone who loves me for who I am.\"\n7. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can offer you support and guidance. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you process and release emotions.\n8. **Give yourself time**: Healing takes time, and it's essential to be patient with yourself. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of the relationship, but also acknowledge that you're growing and evolving as a person.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to take your time, and it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and you don't have to face it alone.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that therapy didn't work for you this time around. That's okay. It might not be the right fit for everyone, and that's okay. You can try again or explore other forms of support that resonate with you.\n\nYou are strong, capable, and deserving of love and happiness. Remember that."

Here's a suggestion: instead of counting down the minutes until 5 PM, try to find ways to make the most of your work hours. \n\nFirstly, take breaks! Take short walks, stretch, or do some quick exercises to get your blood flowing. Sometimes, a change of scenery or a brief pause can help you refocus.\n\nSecondly, prioritize your tasks. Identify the most important and challenging ones, and tackle those first. You might feel more accomplished and energized when you tackle the tough stuff early on.\n\nThirdly, find ways to make your work more enjoyable.

Then he also admited that it was not only time when he kissed a girl on a night out with his friends, it happended before but with a random girl in the club. He probably thought I'm gonna find out about that too so he told me. I know he also cheated on his ex years ago as well, he told me thos when we got together.\n\nHe tells me that he done it all because he was depressed and in dark place and it made him feel good about himself.

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're struggling to reconcile your feelings and doubts about your partner's behavior.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that his actions are not just \"mistakes\" or \"bad decisions.\" He has a pattern of behavior that indicates a lack of respect for your relationship and a willingness to prioritize his own desires over your feelings. His lies and deception are a significant breach of trust, and it's natural to question whether he can change.\n\nRegarding his remorse, it's crucial to pay attention to his actions, not just his words. While he's expressing regret and apologizing, it's essential to see if he's taking concrete steps to address the underlying issues that led to his behavior. Has he:\n\n1. Acknowledged the harm he caused you and taken responsibility for his actions?\n2. Made amends by apologizing sincerely and consistently, not just when he's in trouble?\n3.

Unhealthy dynamics: Keeping in touch can create an unhealthy dynamic where you're constantly questioning his intentions, feelings, or actions.\n3.

Small examples include: cleaning out my inbox, record everything in detail (including unimportant things), closing browser tabs as soon as I finish (only to reopen them a minute later.)\n\nYes being organized is great in most situations, but would like to figure out good ways to balance this.  Appreciate any tips you have!",
    "human": "Prioritizing is a good idea. A bit of a warning though - as someone who is becoming organized. Once you start to let things slide it can become a slippery slope. I find that I have to remain strict with myself and consistent on what can or cannot wait to be done. Otherwise it creeps into other things being neglected that shouldn't. \n\nSo my advice is this: sit down and decide what you do and do not want to keep your organization habits in. If you find yourself not wanting to let go of them, you can set yourself limits. For example, you can allow yourself a certain amount of time to do your recordings (set a timer if you have to), then stop. Force yourself to be satisfied with what you have down. In time you will get to where you can do it more efficiently (only getting down what's important) and within your set time limit. \n\nFor compulsive habits like the browser tabs, force a time limit in the other direction. For example, make yourself keep your tab open for a full three minutes when you're finished with a website. If you decide you're completely finished with the web, you can close it out. If not, move on to the next website and start your time at the end of that one. You'll eventually train yourself to just go from site to site without closing the tab.\n\nThe biggest mistake people make when trying to change their habits is doing it too drastically all at once. This sets unrealistic goals and sets the person up for failure. By making minor changes like keeping your habits but putting a limitation on them you can work toward changing the limits instead of the habits all together.  You're still indulging your urges but on your own terms, so it doesn't feel as daunting as quitting something.cold turkey. \n\nGood luck to you, I hope this helps!",

In fact, research suggests that a bit of chaos can actually stimulate creativity and problem-solving skills. So, don't beat yourself up over it!\n\nHere are some tips to help you find comfort with being disorganized:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Designate specific times for organization and decluttering. This could be a daily or weekly routine, depending on your schedule. This way, you'll have a sense of control and accomplishment without feeling like you're constantly tidying up.\n2. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most important tasks and let go of the rest. You don't need to organize every single thing. Ask yourself, \"Is this really worth my time and energy?\" If not, let it go.\n3. **Embrace the 'good enough' mentality**: Recognize that sometimes, good enough is, well, good enough. Don't stress about having everything perfectly organized. Your brain (and the universe) will still function just fine with a little bit of mess.\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: When you catch yourself getting anxious about being disorganized, take a deep breath and acknowledge the feeling. Remind yourself that it's okay to be imperfect and that you're doing the best you can.\n5. **Find a 'home' for clutter**: Instead of trying to keep everything spotless, designate a 'clutter zone' or a specific area where you can temporarily store items that don't have a designated home. This can help reduce anxiety and give you a sense of control.\n6. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize apps, reminders, and digital tools to help you stay on top of tasks and deadlines. This can help reduce the need for excessive organization and allow you to focus on more important things.\n7. **Schedule self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can help counterbalance the stress of being disorganized and give you a sense of fulfillment.\n8. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of seeing disorganization as a negative, try to view it as an opportunity to practice flexibility, adaptability, and resilience. Remember, life is messy, and being organized all the time isn't always possible or practical.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to adjust. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself. With practice, you'll find a balance that works for you.\n\nHow do these tips resonate with you? What are some strategies that have worked for you in the past?"

Not against her, but at the thought of her doing it.\n\nI'm not going to stop her, she's free to make her own decisions and I'll support her as long as she is being safe, but can you guys give me some advice on how as to how to come to terms with this new stage in her life?\n\nRationally I know it's fine.

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's natural to feel a mix of emotions when your child grows up and becomes more independent. It's like your brain is trying to reconcile the fact that your little girl is now a young adult, and that can be tough to adjust to.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel a sense of loss or discomfort when your child becomes more independent and starts making their own decisions, especially when it comes to something as intimate as sex. It's a natural part of parenting, and it's normal to feel a sense of vulnerability or uncertainty.\n\nNow, here's what might help:\n\n1. **Practice acceptance**: Recognize that your daughter is growing up, and it's a natural part of life. Accept that she'll make her own choices, and it's not up to you to dictate what she does. Focus on being supportive and loving, rather than trying to control the situation.\n2. **Communicate with your daughter**: Talk to your daughter about your feelings, but do it in a non-judgmental and open-minded way. Let her know that you love and support her, and that you're there for her, but also that you're struggling with your own emotions. This can help her understand your perspective and feel more connected to you.\n3. **Focus on your relationship**: Instead of worrying about your daughter's sexuality, focus on nurturing your relationship with her. Spend quality time together, do things you both enjoy, and have open and honest conversations about life, values, and goals.\n4. **Reframe your thinking**: Try to reframe your thoughts about your daughter's sexuality. Instead of focusing on the sex itself, think about the person she is becoming – her values, her goals, her relationships, and her overall well-being. Focus on the positive aspects of her growth and development.\n5. **Seek support for yourself**: Don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if you're feeling overwhelmed. Sharing your feelings with someone who understands can help you process and come to terms with your emotions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel a range of emotions when your child grows up and becomes more independent. It's a normal part of the parenting journey, and with time, patience, and support, you'll adjust to this new stage in your relationship with your daughter."

She preferred being alone with a 6 month old and a dying mother than being in that marriage. My mother ended up having a more successful career than his. and remarrying a great guy later in life.\n\nHe never called me on my birthdays or participated in my life in any way, never been to a school event or a Dr. appointment, and although I saw him on school holidays, he was always hyper-critical, mean, dismissive... all he did was pay child support - then blame me personally for his relative poverty every time I saw him, because if “he didn’t have to pay child support he would be much better off”.\n\nYet every birthday I would watch to see if the phone rang, hoping he would remember, hoping he would call. I would have that hope and eyes to the telephone and yet again nothing and then my hope would be crushed towards 10 or 11pm. Because he wouldn't be bothered with the smallest thing. Not even a phone call on my birthday. As I got older I learnt to forget about his birthday \"do not call\". Eventually I stopped making all the effort and stopped doing the work and that meant I would never hear from him. Except hearsay from my half siblings \"he always asks how you are\". The same way you hear about half-forgotten high school acquaintances. That's also how I hear about my dad. \n\nHe wasn't there for me. The giant gaping hole of his absence  was. Hope somehow never died and neither did the disappointment that always came the moment I raised my expectations about him, anywhere above zero. Anything above zero meant hope followed by disappointment then awareness of gaping hole. So I changed my expectations to zero and have felt so much better since. In Portuguese there is an expression , \"um zero`a esquerda\" \"to be the zero to the left\" [in a mathematical equation]. That means to be irrelevant, to be the zero that makes no difference to the final number. That's my dad.\n\nFrom him I took the life-long impression I am unlovable and I must have all my walls up because I am on my own if I want to survive. I attracted people who thought of me that way. Now I feel immense relief and I am embrace God to teach me I am lovable, since I never got any love from my father. I don't know what fatherly love is. I pray to open myself up to Spirit so I can feel a higher love I have never felt from my parental figure.\n\nI feel some anger at him for never loving me. And then I feel IMMENSE relief because this symbolic step is a new stage where I can reinvent myself and love myself instead of letting my absent father and the lack of love define me. \n\nOn top of it, he went on to marry someone else and had three kids and I’m close to most of them. I also really like my stepmom. But I think I’m the only one who really knows who he really is like in the sense that with a malignant narcissist, if you reject him or his treatment he will be scapegoated and that’s what happened. So I avoided contact as much as possible. \n\nThen the second family went through what I went through when I was younger and I think that’s when they realized who he really is. Before they believed his victim tales.\n\nAnd throughout his life he was all about being a so-called do Gooder. It was all about “helping others” and emotionally abusing his immediate family. Because they grew up with him and he was very present in their life, they are in fact grieving and feel sad. But I don’t really.\n\nTLDR: Absent father is dying. I don't feel 'grief' and I am looking to learn from others who may have felt similarly about their fathers, how they've dealt with the passing of their father.",

You've already grieved the loss of a fatherly love and presence in your life, and his absence has had a lasting impact on your self-perception.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention the concept of \"um zero à esquerda\" - being irrelevant, making no difference.

It's never too late to learn what love can look like, and I'm sure you'll find it in unexpected places.\n\nAs for dealing with the passing of your father, it might be helpful to focus on your own healing and growth. You've already taken the first step by acknowledging the pain and hurt he caused. Now, you can continue to nurture your self-love and acceptance.

Are you seeking validation, avoiding responsibility, or trying to fit in? Understanding your motivations will help you address the root cause.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Start by setting boundaries with your friends. Learn to say \"no\" or \"not right now\" when you don't feel like doing something. Practice assertive communication to express your needs and feelings.\n3. **Find your own interests**: Engage in activities you enjoy, even if your friends aren't involved.

This will help you develop a sense of identity separate from your friendships.\n4. **Develop a sense of purpose**: Discover what drives you and gives you a sense of fulfillment.

Having someone to talk to and offer support will help you feel less isolated and more confident in your ability to change.\n9. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks.

It's not uncommon for people with depression to develop coping mechanisms that can affect their communication style. It's impressive that you've been working on this in therapy, and I'm happy to offer some additional insights.\n\nThe phenomenon you're describing is often referred to as \"cognitive dissonance\" or \"speech anxiety.\" It's when there's a disconnect between your thoughts and the words that come out of your mouth. This can be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. Fear of being judged or rejected: As someone who's struggled with depression, you might be hesitant to express yourself openly, fearing others will judge you or reject your thoughts and feelings.\n2. Overthinking: Depression can lead to rumination, which can make it challenging to articulate your thoughts in the moment. You might be thinking through your words too much, leading to stalling or stammering.\n3. Difficulty with self-advocacy: Depression can also make it hard to prioritize your own needs and express them clearly. You might struggle to assert yourself or communicate your boundaries.\n\nTo overcome this, I recommend exploring a few strategies:\n\n1. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness exercises can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. This increased self-awareness can translate to improved communication. You can try apps like Headspace or Calm to get started.\n2. Role-playing: In therapy, you can practice role-playing conversations with your therapist. This can help you build confidence in expressing yourself and develop a sense of comfort with your thoughts and feelings.\n3. Small steps: Start with small, low-stakes conversations, like chatting with a friend or family member about a non-depressing topic. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually work on more meaningful discussions.\n4. Focus on listening: Instead of worrying about what to say, focus on listening actively to the other person. This can help you build rapport and feel more connected, making it easier to express yourself.\n5. Self-compassion: Be kind to yourself when you struggle to communicate. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's a process.\n\nRemember, it's great that you're acknowledging this challenge and seeking help. Keep working with your therapist, and don't hesitate to explore new strategies that work for you."

As I was in the process to cancel the card, my fiancé informed me that she was the one using it and that I don’t need to cancel it and apologized profusely for using it without my knowledge.

I am more concerned that she was ok with taking the card and using it without me knowing and that this is not the first time this has happened.

It wasn't until my early 20s I realized how toxic and gross that mentality was and started taking steps to stop it.\n\nAt about 15 I started developing feelings for Stella and was convinced I was in love. Due to the nice guy mentality I usually burned bridges with girls I liked because I couldn't handle my feelings, but things were different with Stella, she got a long term boyfriend and I continued to be friends with her. We stayed close and I got to know her boyfriend, me and him were never best friends but got along, and I never went out my way to fuel any fire that their relationship had. All this just to explain, I saw Stella differently than the others who I burned bridges with and never wanted to lose her because how stupid I was. I was even semi taken in by her family as I had a bad home life.\n\nShe married her boyfriend John(different from the boyfriend mentioned above) about 3 years ago when they moved cross country. They moved back about a year ago, and at one point one of our other friends kinda messed up thinking they broke up and told her he was interested but didn't know if I'd be okay with it and she was confused and brought it up to me jokingly while the 2 of us were having a movie night. I laughed and admitted that I was super in love with her when we first met and that everyone knew, to which she told me she didn't, I  apologized and said I didn't want to push things and was happy we were friends and she had the life she was living, and we went on with our movie and I thought that was that.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago Stella's husband John died suddenly and we were all kind of taken by shock.

We've been taking shifts and staying with her just in case she needed anything.\n\nLast night I was at her place with her and we were watching a movie after her family left. She started crying and I went to hug her and try to comfort her. As the hug ended she looked at me and leaned in and kissed me. I was shocked and I think visibly because she said goodnight and went to her room. I ended up going home and we haven't talked since last night.\n\nI don't know what to do, she's my friend and I do love her, but that kiss hit me like a truck and now I don't know whether it's as a friend or if I'm in love with her. I know she's going through a tremendous amount of grief and don't want to make her deal with that alone, but I don't know how she feels about or sees me and I don't want to hurt her.

Try to understand where they're coming from and be patient with each other's quirks. Remember, you're not going to change each other, so focus on finding common ground.\n4. **Create a 'quiet time'**: If you're a morning person and your roommate is a night owl, establish a quiet time or designated study hours to ensure you both have space to focus on your studies.\n5. **Take breaks and prioritize self-care**: Living with someone you don't get along with can be draining. Make time for activities that bring you joy, exercise, and relaxation. This will help you maintain a healthy perspective and reduce stress.\n6. **Seek mediation if needed**: If conflicts arise, try to address them promptly and calmly. If things get heated or unresolved, consider seeking mediation from a trusted mutual friend or a professional counselor.\n7. **Prioritize your own needs**: Remember that you're not responsible for your roommate's happiness or well-being. Focus on your own goals, priorities, and well-being. If you need some alone time, don't hesitate to take it.\n8. **Keep things in perspective**: Remember that you're in this temporary living situation for a year, and it's not a reflection of your worth or identity. Keep things in perspective and focus on the bigger picture.\n\nAs for your friend of a friend, try to approach the situation with an open mind. You might be surprised to find common ground or shared interests. If you do have concerns, address them openly and honestly, just like with your other roommate.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to not love every aspect of your living situation. Focus on finding ways to make it work for you, and don't be afraid to re-evaluate if things become unbearable."

    "sentence": "Edit: Please do not share this to other subreddits, videos etc. I would prefer to just keep the discussion on this forum\n\nMy fiance (m29) and I (f25) have been together 5 years now. We are a multiracial couple - him being mixed as well as myself. I have known from the beginning that I was not the typical type of girl he dates - all his exes were the same race and build/look - I am the complete opposite. I won't lie, it did bother me at the time as I was struggling with an eating disorder in those college years. I eventually got help and overcame my illness and have been actively working on my self-esteem and body dysmorphia - I am now proudly 6 years free of my ED. He did help me get through that tough time.\n\nNow to the issue - we were sleeping in the other morning when he decided he wanted some morning action. I was half asleep so suggested a lazy, cuddling while spooning session (his favorite). We started at it when he needed to go to the bathroom. Now, I am not a delusional prude - I know men are visual beings, I know he watches p\\*\\*n - I'm not stupid and I don't care. My only expectation is that viewing is kept discreet and private - the less I know about the details the better. P\\*\\*n is not something I partake in anymore myself as part of my recovery from my ED. I'm just personally mindful of what I consume but I do not expect the same from others. Do not misjudge me - I am not against the viewing of p\\*\\*n, I don't think it makes you a bad person - sex is natural, he can do that, just keep it separate. So.. He came back to the bed more excited than when he left so I put 2 and 2 together.\n\nI didn't mind, I'm excited too so we continue on with our session. At the end once he finishes, I turn around to kiss him and his face is just glued to his phone. I ask him if he's been on it this whole time and he gets a shock that I was facing him and drops the phone. I pick it up and open it and hes on some NSFW subreddit - he was having sex with me while looking at other women. In that moment the level of shame and disgust I felt was overwhelming - it really took me back to those dark days in college and my ED. Those days when I was always comparing myself to others.\n\nHe's been silent since then - I won't let him touch me - even to hug. I feel so gross - like a toy, nothing better than a fleshlight. I didn't know he was on his phone while we were doing it. I feel used. And all the women he was watching while he was in me were all his \"type\". It kinda breaks my heart. Im mostly upset at the looking at p\\*\\*n while we're making love - but I won't lie that I'm also upset at the realization, that I will never measure up or look even remotely similar to these women he would rather look at. I'm tryna go through all my Cognitive Behavioural Therapy stuff - the processes - assure myself but I can't seem to stem the hurt. Am I overreacting? I don't know how to make the pain stop.\n\nTLDR: My fiance got caught looking at other women while having sexy time with me and Im really upset and dont know what to do about it - im shocked honestly\n\n●●●●●●\n\nEDIT 2: Okaayyy this blew up more than I expected - thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment. I appreciate all the thoughts, advice, prayers, love and anger felt on my behalf. There's so much going on right now I can't write about everything\n\nFirst off, I had the discussion with him. He was too scared to bring it up and apologize and admitted to being a coward and admitted to a porn addiction And then I got pretty pissed off and it all just came out... it went from disappointment to disgust to anger to disgust again and now indifference.\n\nAnyways, cut a long story short - I've called off the marriage - he's seeking help independently and I'm focusing on my business because it's Christmas and Im busy and I got paying customers to care for. \n\nAlso my grandma is over for the holidays so I will be spending my time with my family and focusing on my work. Im taking it one step at a time but I gotta focus on myself right now and enjoy the better things in my life this December. \n\nI can handle the rest after my much needed Christmas holiday.",

How do I get myself out of this rut?\n\nI'm looking for the balance of assertive, yet non-bitchy, with a healthy dash of \"how the hell do I calm the massive internal adrenaline rush I get when I need to voice an opposing viewpoint\".",

Tightened muscles, heightened heart beat, etc. Knowing what's going on helps you to control it and overcome it. \n\nThis same trick works with all emotions. You have to let them flow through you. They're your bodies natural response to the stimuli around you, so there's nothing you can do to eliminate them.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Confrontation can be super uncomfortable, but it's a crucial part of building healthy relationships and setting boundaries. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you become more comfortable with confrontation:\n\n1. **Acknowledge your emotions**: Recognize that your internal adrenaline rush is a normal response to perceived threat or discomfort. It's not a personal failing; it's a natural reaction. Take a deep breath, and acknowledge the feeling. This helps to diffuse the tension and gives you a moment to think before responding.\n2. **Identify your goals**: Before entering a confrontational situation, define what you hope to achieve. What's the specific issue you want to address? What do you want to communicate? What's your non-negotiable? Clarity on your goals will help you stay focused and assertive.\n3. **Practice self-reflection**: Take time to understand your own biases, values, and emotions. This will help you stay grounded and avoid being reactive. Ask yourself:\n\t* What are my non-negotiables?\n\t* What are my boundaries?\n\t* What are my values, and how do they relate to this situation?\n4. **Use \"I\" statements**: When expressing your concerns or opposing viewpoint, use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements. This helps to own your emotions and thoughts, making it harder for the other person to become defensive. For example:\n\t* \"I feel frustrated when...\" instead of \"You always...\"\n\t* \"I think that...\" instead of \"You're wrong because...\"\n5. **Stay calm and composed**: Take a few deep breaths, count to 10, or step away for a moment to collect your thoughts. This helps to regulate your emotions and prevent the adrenaline rush from taking over.\n6. **Listen actively**: Make an effort to truly listen to the other person's perspective. Repeat back what you've heard to ensure understanding, and ask clarifying questions. This shows you value their input and are open to finding a resolution.\n7. **Be specific and concrete**: Avoid generalizations or assumptions. Instead, focus on specific behaviors or actions that are causing the issue. For example, \"I've noticed that when we're in meetings, you often interrupt others. I feel disrespected when that happens.\"\n8. **Seek common ground**: Look for areas of agreement and try to find a mutually beneficial solution. Be willing to compromise and find a middle ground.\n9. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice assertive communication, the more comfortable you'll become. Start with low-stakes situations, like talking to a friend or family member, and work your way up to more challenging conversations.\n10. **Celebrate your successes**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if they feel insignificant. This will help you build confidence and reinforce positive habits.\n\nRemember, becoming comfortable with confrontation takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get it right immediately. With time and effort, you'll become more confident and effective in your communication."

As an 18-year-old, you're wise to recognize the impact of small habits on your overall well-being. Here are some common stressors that might be affecting you without you realizing it:\n\n1. **Digital habits**: Are you constantly checking your phone, social media, or email? This can lead to a sense of constant anxiety, even if you're not consciously thinking about it. Try setting specific times to check your devices and take breaks from them.\n2. **Sleep schedule**: Are you getting enough sleep? Most adults need 7-9 hours. Lack of sleep can cause fatigue, irritability, and decreased productivity. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to improve sleep quality.\n3. **Nutrition and hydration**: Are you eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein? Are you drinking enough water throughout the day? A poor diet can lead to energy crashes, mood swings, and decreased focus.\n4. **Exercise and physical activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety. Are you engaging in physical activities that bring you joy, such as walking, jogging, yoga, or team sports? Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day.\n5. **Social media comparison**: Are you comparing your life to others on social media? This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, FOMO, and decreased self-esteem. Try to limit your social media use, and focus on following accounts that inspire and uplift you.\n6. **Time management**: Are you procrastinating on tasks, leading to feelings of guilt and stress? Prioritize your tasks, break them down into smaller chunks, and set realistic deadlines to help you stay on track.\n7. **Financial stress**: Are you living paycheck to paycheck or struggling to manage your finances? Consider setting a budget, creating a savings plan, and seeking guidance from a financial advisor if needed.\n8. **Clutter and disorganization**: Besides cleaning your room and house, are there other areas of your life that could benefit from decluttering, such as your digital files, email inbox, or mental space? Clearing out clutter can help reduce mental and emotional overwhelm.\n9. **Time spent with others**: Are you spending quality time with friends and family, or are you feeling isolated or disconnected? Make an effort to schedule regular social activities and prioritize meaningful connections.\n10. **Self-care**: Are you taking time for yourself to relax, recharge, and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment? Prioritize self-care activities like meditation, reading, or hobbies to help reduce stress and increase overall well-being.\n\nReflect on these areas and see if there are any patterns or habits that might be contributing to your stress levels.

    "sentence": "**tl;dr - both of my parents are gone and my biomom (egg donor/aunt) and her husband have been like parents to me in the last few years, but out of the blue she said she's leaving him and she needs me to buy a house for her and my three half-siblings with the money I inherited from my parents. I have my own debts and life to worry about and she is very bad with money. I don't know how to say no without losing the only family I have left.**\n\nMy biomom (donated eggs to my mom) did not raise me--I grew up with my dad and gestational mom (my biomom's older sister) in another state. My parents both died so, my biomom took me in during COVID after my school dorms shut down. I'm grateful to her for this, especially since she already had 3 kids to take care of. She seemed to really want to have a mother-daughter relationship with me even though she'd been my aunt growing up and it meant a lot for me to have that connection after my parents passed. Her husband (my uncle) is very supportive and quickly came to fill the vacant father-figure role in my life. I'm now back in my home state and have a lot of student loan debt stacking up from grad school but I inherited money from my parents that I was going to use to help pay off my debt and eventually maybe buy a house in the future when I get a real job. My biomom knows I inherited that money and that it's just collecting dust rather than being invested.\n\nMy biomom recently told me, out of the blue, that she's leaving my kind, stable, well-off uncle and wants me to buy her a house in the Bay Area so my half-siblings can still live near their dad and stay in their schools. She says I should think of it as an investment in my future because when my half-siblings grow up she can rent out their rooms and it'll give me a return on the money I \"invested\" in her house. She says that housing prices are just going up in the area in the future so I'll be able to sell for a lot more than I bought it for when the kids are grown.\n\nShe thinks that if she gets a job (which isn't going to be easy because she's been a stay at home mom for years and never finished high school because she got pregnant with her first child who isn't in the picture now) she'll be able to pay her \"share\" of the mortgage, but she wants me to pay the down payment for her. I don't know how she's going to pay for that and feed three kids and herself on minimum wage, if she's even able to find a job at her age with zero employment history. She has gambling issues but fancies herself an investor. She has taken out loans and then gambled them away on Crypto and risky investments or at literal casinos before, and then I'll get a call at 2am asking for money to bail her out before my uncle finds out.\n\nShe keeps stressing how I'm her daughter by blood and she just needs me to chip in and I'll get a big return on my \"investment\" later when her kids grow up and I can sell it and that this is the best thing I can do financially even though I will never live in the house myself. She won't accept help from anyone but me. She says it's the best thing for my half-siblings to live near their dad and stay in their schools and all of their activities. I do love them and want the best for them, but this will mean having to change my entire career to afford my student loans. I feel like I owe her after all she's done for me, but money doesn't go as far as she thinks and I am going to need it to start my life after grad school. I've even told her they could all come stay with me in my state (much cheaper) after I graduate if I'm able to buy a house here by then. But, she's adamant about having them stay near their dad and their schools. Maybe I am being greedy.\n\nI don't know how to tell her no without her thinking I'm a selfish greedy ingrate who doesn't really see her as family. I don't want to be cut out of my half-siblings lives. I also don't want to have to take sides in this divorce, even though I'm not blood related to my uncle. I hate what this is going to do to my half-siblings. It feels like I'm losing both of my parents all over again.",
    "human": "I say this as a mother myself: You don’t owe her anything, you’re not being selfish or greedy. Parents take care of their children, that’s their job. Children take care of their parents when they can’t take care of themselves, but that’s not what’s happening here. Your bio-mom is putting you in a terrible, unfair situation by asking you to solve problems she created with her choices. She is guilting you into letting her steal the money your parents left you. It’s awful, I’m so sorry she’s put you in this position. One strategy you might use: Talk with a financial advisor about the best way to protect your inheritance (you might want to do this anyway). Then, when you tell your biomom that you can’t help her, you can hold the financial advisor responsible for the decision: “My advisor told me that this money needs to go into an ___ account for ___ years, I’m sorry I can’t help you now.” You also might want to try some counseling — have you already been to grief counseling? This would help you sort through your feelings of loss, and see your relationship with your biomom through different eyes.",
    "base_reply": "I can sense the weight of responsibility and guilt you're carrying. It's understandable that you're torn between your loyalty to your biomom and your own needs. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your biomom's request is unreasonable and potentially harmful to your own financial stability. You've inherited a significant amount of money, and using it to buy a house for your biomom and her family might not be the best decision for you. It's essential to prioritize your own financial security and well-being.\n\nIt's also crucial to recognize that your biomom's decision to leave your uncle and her lack of financial stability are not your responsibility. You can't control her choices, and it's not your duty to bail her out of her financial problems.\n\nHere's a suggestion: have an open and honest conversation with your biomom about your concerns. Explain that you appreciate her request, but you're not in a financial position to buy a house for her and her family. You can express your love and appreciation for them, but also be clear about your own financial limitations.\n\nIt's essential to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You can offer alternative solutions, such as helping with temporary housing or financial assistance for a short period, but make it clear that you cannot take on the long-term responsibility of buying a house.\n\nRemember that you're not being selfish by prioritizing your own needs. You're making a responsible decision for your own financial future. It's okay to say no to your biomom's request, and it's not a reflection of your love and appreciation for her and your half-siblings.\n\nWhen having this conversation, try to focus on your own needs and limitations rather than attacking your biomom's decisions or character. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or shaming language. For example:\n\n\"I understand that you're going through a tough time, and I want to help. However, I'm not in a financial position to buy a house for you and your family. I'm still paying off my own student loans and trying to establish my career. I'm happy to help in other ways, such as providing temporary financial assistance or finding alternative housing solutions. Let's explore other options together.\"\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this decision. You can seek guidance from a trusted friend, family member, or professional advisor to help you navigate this challenging situation."

Let's break it down together.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you have a lot to say is a huge step forward! It's not that you're not capable of expressing yourself, but rather, you're holding yourself back. I'm not going to sugarcoat it – overcoming shyness takes time, effort, and patience, but it's worth it.\n\nHere's a crucial thing to understand: shyness isn't about being weak or inferior; it's often a natural response to feeling anxious or uncertain in social situations. So, let's work on building your confidence and comfort levels.\n\nStart small! Begin by sharing your thoughts and opinions with people you trust, like close friends or family members. It might feel weird at first, but the more you do it, the easier it'll become. You can even try writing down your thoughts and sharing them with others – it's a great way to get your ideas out without feeling too exposed.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to focus on active listening. When you're in conversations, make an effort to really listen to others and show genuine interest. This can help you feel more connected and build your confidence.\n\nNow, about that fear of getting shot down or saying something uncool... Remember that everyone has those moments, even the most outgoing people! It's okay to make mistakes – it's how you learn and grow. Instead of focusing on the fear of failure, try to reframe it as an opportunity to learn and improve.\n\nLastly, practice, practice, practice! Take small steps outside your comfort zone, and gradually increase your exposure to new social situations. You might start by attending small gatherings, joining a club or group that aligns with your interests, or even just striking up conversations with strangers in a low-pressure setting.\n\nRemember, overcoming shyness is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. You got this!"

Take advantage of these resources to help you navigate the ups and downs of parenthood.\n8. **Don't compare yourself to others**: Every parent is different, and what works for someone else might not work for you.

Whether it's your partner, family, or friends, don't be afraid to ask for support.\n10. **Love and cherish your partner**: Parenting can put a strain on relationships, but it's essential to prioritize your relationship with your partner.

S has told me she is sometimes nervous to be naked around me now because of her friends, but I have told her she's just perfect for me and I enjoy having sex with her.\n\nI dont mean to offend anyone,  but I personally prefer a thicker woman for myself. The sex is just better and more comfortable. We were all hanging out again recently and her friends said that I \"took one for the team\" and I told S to ignore them. They said someone like me should be with a much better looking woman (which isn't true) and I know that hurt S's feelings.\n\nI told them off right then and there and tried reassuring S away from them.

However, it's also important to recognize that your relationship with her is still based on a physical connection, and it might be beneficial to explore other aspects of your connection, such as emotional intimacy and shared interests.\n\nRegarding her self-esteem, it's understandable that her friends' comments might have hurt her feelings.

It's possible that she's feeling self-conscious about her body because of past experiences or insecurities, and having an open and honest conversation about this might help her feel more comfortable and secure in her own skin.\n\nLastly, it's important to recognize that you can't change how others feel or think, but you can control how you respond to them. It might be helpful to set boundaries with S's friends and let them know that their comments are not welcome or acceptable.

It's not okay for him to make light of your feelings or dismiss your emotions.

Or, if you want to be more proactive, start posting ideas for people with similar interests to meet up. Alternatively, if you’re ok with more online only friendships, dive into some subreddits on topics you’re interested in. From there you can start getting involved in conversations with a goal of finding or starting a Discord server to join, where you can have live discussions with people who you know share an interest.\n\nThese are just the things that worked for me - your situation is totally your own, and you may have to make adjustments that fit you best.

That takes a lot of courage!\n\nGiven your circumstances, here are some ideas that might help you make new friends without breaking the bank or sacrificing too much time:\n\n1. **Online communities**: Look for online forums, social media groups, or Discord servers centered around topics you're passionate about. This way, you can engage with like-minded people who share your interests, and it's easy to participate at your own pace.\n2. **Meetup groups**: While you mentioned you can't join a sports club, there are many Meetup groups that focus on activities like book clubs, language exchange, board game nights, or volunteer work. These often have a more relaxed atmosphere and can be a great way to meet people with similar interests.\n3. **Coffee or game nights**: Invite acquaintances, colleagues, or online friends over for a casual get-together. You can play games, watch a movie, or just chat over coffee. This way, you can build relationships in a low-pressure setting.\n4. **Volunteer work**: Look for local organizations or charities that need help. Not only will you be giving back to your community, but you'll also meet like-minded people who share your values.\n5. **Language exchange**: If you're interested in learning a new language or practicing a language you already know, find a language exchange partner online or in-person. This can be a great way to build a connection with someone who shares your interest.\n6. **Neighborhood events**: Attend local events, such as street festivals, farmers' markets, or community potlucks. These events can be a great way to meet people who live nearby and share similar interests.\n7. **Support group**: Since your partner struggles with mental health issues, consider joining a support group or online community focused on mental health. This can be a safe space to connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n8. **Schedule regular check-ins**: Make time for regular video calls or phone calls with friends, even if it's just a quick 15-minute catch-up. This will help you stay connected and maintain relationships.\n9. **Be patient and kind to yourself**: Building friendships takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on nurturing the relationships you do have, and don't be too hard on yourself if it takes a little longer to find new friends.\n10. **Prioritize self-care**: Remember to take care of your physical and mental health. With your busy schedule, it's essential to prioritize self-care and make time for relaxation and stress management.\n\nRemember, making friends as an adult can be challenging, but it's not impossible.

It's not about being a \"wetwipe\" or not being \"manly enough.\" It's about being aware of your surroundings and taking care of yourself.\n\nAs for dealing with loud and aggressive strangers, here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. Trust your instincts: If you feel uncomfortable or scared, it's okay to take a step back or avoid the situation altogether. Don't feel pressured to confront or engage with someone who's being aggressive or threatening.\n2. Stay calm and assertive: If you need to interact with someone, try to remain calm and assertive. Look them in the eye, speak clearly, and firmly tell them you're not interested in talking or engaging. Avoid apologetic or submissive body language, as it can be misinterpreted as weakness.\n3. Use your friends as a buffer: When walking with friends, try to stay close to them and use their presence as a buffer. If a stranger approaches, your friends can help distract or intervene if needed.\n4. Practice assertive responses: Rehearse responding to aggressive or confrontational situations in a calm and assertive manner. This can help you feel more confident and prepared in real-life situations.\n5. Focus on self-care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical and emotional well-being. Exercise regularly, eat well, and get enough sleep. This can help boost your confidence and reduce feelings of anxiety.\n\nAs for what's causing your fear, it's likely a combination of factors, including:\n\n* Lack of familiarity with the environment and cultural norms\n* Fear of being targeted due to language barriers or perceived vulnerability\n* Past experiences or trauma\n* Media portrayals of aggression and violence\n\nIt's essential to recognize that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience fear or anxiety in similar situations.\n\nRegarding becoming more confident or \"manly,\" I'd advise against trying to fit into societal expectations of masculinity. Instead, focus on building self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-care. Practice self-compassion and recognize that it's okay to be vulnerable or scared sometimes.\n\nLastly, don't worry about posting here; this is a safe space for sharing your concerns and getting advice.

    "base_reply": "Starting a conversation can be tough, especially with new people! It's great that you're aware of your strengths in carrying a conversation, and now let's work on building that bridge to get started.\n\nHere's a simple yet effective approach:\n\n1. **Observe and find common ground**: Take a glance around the setting and notice what's happening, who's there, and what's being discussed. Look for something that catches your attention, like a shared interest, a common topic, or even a shared experience. This can be a great conversation starter.\n2. **Use open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves. This will help you build a connection and create a flow of conversation. For example:\n\t* \"What brings you here today?\"\n\t* \"How was your weekend?\"\n\t* \"What do you like to do in your free time?\"\n3. **Find a lighthearted or relatable topic**: Sometimes, starting with a lighthearted or relatable topic can help break the ice. This could be a funny story, a recent event, or a popular trend. For example:\n\t* \"Have you seen that new movie/TV show everyone's been talking about?\"\n\t* \"How's your favorite sports team doing this season?\"\n\t* \"I just tried this new restaurant and loved it, have you been?\"\n4. **Be genuine and authentic**: People can usually tell when you're being insincere or trying too hard. Be yourself, and let your personality shine through. Share your own experiences and interests, and ask follow-up questions to show you're genuinely interested in getting to know the other person.\n5. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what the other person is saying and show that you're engaged. This will help build trust and keep the conversation flowing. Avoid interrupting, and let the other person finish their thoughts before you respond.\n\nRemember, starting a conversation is not about being perfect; it's about being genuine, curious, and respectful. With practice, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your ability to start conversations with new people.\n\nHow do these tips sound? Do you have any specific scenarios or situations where you struggle to start conversations?"

    "sentence": "Disclaimer: Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom!\n\nPlease let me say one thing first: This is an issue that me and my boyfriend have been talking about for a while now, so please don't immediately assume it stems from a lack of communication. I am looking for some outside perspective here, because I don't want to overlook anything and keep an open mind.\n\nFor context: I (26f) got together with my boyfriend (28m) about 1,5 years ago after being friends for a few years. When the second wave of the pandemic hit, we were prohibited from leaving our houses after 9pm, which made our platonic dinners turn into not-so-platonic sleepovers. We told our very tight knit group of friends about stuff happening pretty soon and made it official after only a month of hooking up.\n\nI was drunk on love. He is honestly the funniest, smartest and kindest man I have ever known. We had always had great conversations, but once we got together they just got so much deeper, like we'd spend an entire weekend together and he'd still text me an hour after leaving his place, because he remembered something he wanted to tell me.\n\nIt's the best relationship I ever had. We moved in together and he is my favorite person to live with by far (I have lived with an ex and several of my best friends). We make it a point to always respect each other's needs and love to spend quality time together at home or going out, while still maintaining some healthy me-time.\n\nCommunication has been good. He was not used to expressing his feelings and needs openly, but has made it a point to learn and is doing so good! I wasn't used to letting a partner take care of me sometimes, as I had always been the 'caregiver' in past relationships. We both had some baggage, which I think is normal for our age, but are both determined to learn and grow together.\n\nThe biggest issue we have has been something we started to notice last summer: I am insanely attracted to him. Not just his body and face, but mostly his laugh, his mind, his mischievious smile when he makes a joke... Everything about him just makes me want to be close to him. I have never been a PDA person in the past, but with him I just can't help myself to sneak a kiss or a hug, even when we're with friends.\n\nFrom the beginning it was clear that our sexual needs are different. I have a decently high libido and would like sex every day or every other day if I could. His libido is very much dependant on outside factors. When there is no stress, like on vacation, his needs are pretty similar to mine. If there is a lot of stuff going on in our lives it's hard for him to relax enough to get intimate. We found ways to deal with those differences, whether it's extra care to help him relax or just some intense cuddling to satisfy my need for intimacy. So that is something we're both okay with now, after working it out together.\n\nI don't mind being the one who initiates sex more often, since I am aware of our differences. But there is a lack of enthusiasm in his behaviour, that I can't get quite over. For example he never used to compliment me, whereas I tell him nice things several times a day. I have expressed this and he is really trying hard. It just wasn't something he had ever done, no one had ever asked him to and he didn't intiate it. \n\nHe will now sometimes tell me when he likes an outfit on me or say my perfume smells good or something. The thing is he will always use words like 'nice' or 'cute'. I know this might seem like a small difference, but I want my partner to see me as beautiful and freaking hot. Like I tell him he is. I know it's not fair to expect something so specific from him, but I can't help it. Combined with his lack of initiating sex it makes me feel an insecurity I never knew.\n\nObviously I don't think I am perfect (there is no such thing, it's all subjective anyways) and have small insecurities about my looks, same as everyone else. But I have never doubted how attracted a partner is to me until now. It's so ironic, I dated my fair share of jerks but they were all good at letting me know how attracted they were to me. I always thought: 'Hey, I might not be perfect, but they want me exactly how I am.' Please don't get me wrong, I am not trying to compare my boyfriend to those people. I'm just explaining why this feeling is so new and unsusual to me.\n\nMy boyfriend says he is just not comfortable using words like 'beautiful', because it makes him feel silly. Like it's over the top and doesn't feel natural to him. I try to be respectful of that, but it's hard. \n\nThere has never once been an instance where he just 'had to' touch me or be with me, because he couldn't help himself. So it's not just a matter of words but also actions. I have let him know repeatedly that I would pretty much consent to anything with him, because that's how much I trust him and want him. And if I didn't like anything in the moment, I could always just tell him. So it's not an issue of him being unsure of boundaries (at least not consciously).\n\nHe just isn't that in touch with his sexuality, like doesn't know what his fantasies are etc. He has made so much progress with talking about stuff but somehow this doesn't seem to change.\n\nWow, this is way too long, I'm gonna stop now. If you're still with me: Sorry! Any advice on how to handle a situation like that or make progress is welcome.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend enjoys when I make a move on him and sometimes stuff just happens when we're cuddling or whatever, but I never get the feeling that he has the same intense passion I have for him. We have talked about stuff, but it doesn't really seem to change.\n\nEdit: Spelling",
    "human": "Hey- it’s you from the future. I’m 7 years older than you and have been with my (now husband) almost 9 years. \n\nHis word when he would compliment me is “fancy,” as in “you look fancy.” I understand why the “cute” or “nice” grates on you because there’s no *passion* in it. \n\nNGL, it’s still occasionally pretty damned defeating not getting compliments and not feeling wanted by him. We have had numerous talks about how I feel, and that I love him so much more than he loves me. It would be nice to feel loved and adored the way I WANT to be loved and adored. \n\nSince we also have incompatible sex drives (I’m high, he’s low- ha! Even in our positions because I’m normally on top), a counselor of mine had suggested looking for non-sexual ways that my husband shows/gives intimacy. That was an interesting shift in viewpoint- to disconnect intimacy and sex. \n\nI just wanted to say that I hear you. Best of luck deciding if this is something you’re able to compromise on or if you want to be loved and appreciated in a way that you’re more receptive of.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've shared a lot of detailed information about your relationship, and I appreciate your willingness to be open and honest. It's clear that you're seeking outside perspective to help you understand and address the issues you're experiencing.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you've had an incredible connection with your boyfriend, and it's natural to feel concerned when you sense a disparity in your desires and needs. It's also understandable that you're struggling with the lack of enthusiasm in his behavior, especially when it comes to initiating sex and expressing his attraction towards you.\n\nRegarding your concerns about his lack of enthusiasm, it's crucial to recognize that everyone has different ways of expressing themselves and their feelings. While you might feel that his reserved nature makes you feel insecure, it's possible that he's simply not comfortable with certain forms of expression or intimacy. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and needs, but also be respectful of his boundaries and comfort level.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that his lack of knowledge about his own sexuality and fantasies might be a contributing factor to his reserved nature. It's great that he's made progress in talking about his feelings and needs, but it's possible that he needs more time and exploration to discover what works for him.\n\nIn terms of making progress, it might be helpful to have a more specific conversation with your boyfriend about your needs and desires. Instead of focusing on his lack of enthusiasm, try to focus on what you're looking for in terms of intimacy and affection. You could say something like, \"Hey, I love spending time with you, but I feel like we don't have as much physical intimacy as I would like. What are some things that make you feel connected and turned on? Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable and excited about being intimate?\"\n\nIt's also essential to prioritize self-care and self-love during this time. Make sure you're taking care of your physical and emotional needs, and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Remember that you deserve to feel seen and appreciated, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires.\n\nLastly, consider couples therapy or counseling to work through these issues together. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to the disparity in your desires.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, compromise, and communication. It's okay to have differences, but it's essential to work together to find common ground and meet each other's needs."

    "sentence": "How to deal with a nonstop talker? I have a few friends who are nonstop talkers. Somehow they are capable of speaking *continuously* for any length of time. I don't know how they do it. I tried imitating them but I just can't keep it up for more than a minute or two because I run out of things to say. They usually talk about something they did, it's never interesting, and there is never a point or a punchline to the story - it's just a thoroughly detailed description of what they did. One time one friend told an endless, pointless story about him taking his dog to the vet. He recounted every possible detail including his dog's facial expressions during the car ride there, in the waiting room, and in the examination room. He recounted every piece of dialog from being greeted by the receptionist to the summary discussion with the veterinarian. Another time another friend *literally spoke nonstop for thirty minutes because I timed it* in a depressing monologue about how Microsoft refuses to support certain outdated products and how that affects his certification or something. Another friend treated me to a monologue about the elderly man that he is a caretaker for, and somehow went from musing about what the old man's life is like to musing over what kind of car my friend might like to buy. One acquaintance was a guy in one of my classes who walked together with me to our bicycles one afternoon and then talked my ear off at the bike rack until I just interrupted him, said goodbye, and literally rode off - *and he still kept talking, but louder, as I rode away*. (How can people be that thick?) I've tried interrupting with stories of my own, but depending on the person, they usually steamroller over me as if my point was made in the opening words of my interruption and they cut me off with something like \"Yeah! And...\" and then the monologue continues. I've also tried smiling, nodding, and saying \"Yeah!\" or forcing out a little fake laugh as if they've made their point, and then walk away, but that doesn't work either. One guy *literally followed me into the bathroom while monologuing*.",
    "human": "My own responses are to listen if the topic is interesting (long-term strategy that pays off), whip out my phone and use it as an encyclopedia (NOT AS A DISRESPECTFUL DISTRACTION, and which might clue them in as to how they're hogging the conversation), or say \"hold that thought, I need to pee.\" The latter example gives me a break from the verbal vomit, and also gives me a chance to come back to the table with \"Oh I forgot to tell you....!,\" which will give me control of the conversational direction...albeit briefly. \n\nI used to try and interrupt, but I eventually came to the conclusion that I'd rather be deemed a \"good listener\" than \"an asshole.\" Let them be the asshole. 😉",
    "base_reply": "I feel your pain! Dealing with nonstop talkers can be draining and frustrating. Here are some strategies that might help you cope:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When someone is talking, make an effort to genuinely listen to what they're saying. This might mean nodding, making eye contact, and asking clarifying questions. Avoid interrupting or planning your response while they're speaking. This can help them feel heard and understood, which might reduce the likelihood of them dominating the conversation.\n2. **Use the \"reflective listening\" technique**: Reflective listening involves paraphrasing or summarizing what the other person has said to show you're actively listening. This can help you avoid interrupting and give you a chance to catch your breath. For example, you could say, \"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying that...?\" or \"So, what I hear you saying is...?\"\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes or no questions, try asking open-ended questions that encourage the person to share more information. This can help redirect the conversation and give you a chance to contribute. For example, \"How did you feel about that experience?\" or \"What did you learn from that situation?\"\n4. **Set boundaries**: If the person is talking nonstop and you're feeling overwhelmed, it's okay to set a boundary. You can say something like, \"I'm really interested in what you're saying, but I'd love to share my own thoughts on this topic. Can I jump in for a minute?\" or \"I'm getting a bit tired of talking; can we switch roles and let me share something?\"\n5. **Practice assertive communication**: If the person is interrupting you or steamrolling over your attempts to contribute, try using assertive communication. You can say something like, \"I'd like to finish my thought before you respond. Can you let me finish speaking?\" or \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'd like to share my perspective as well.\"\n6. **Limit your interactions**: If you find that certain people consistently dominate conversations, it might be necessary to limit your interactions with them. This can be tough, especially if they're friends or acquaintances, but it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n7. **Seek common ground**: Try to find topics or activities that you both enjoy, which can help shift the conversation and give you a chance to contribute. This can be as simple as asking about their hobbies or interests or suggesting doing something together.\n8. **Practice self-care**: Dealing with nonstop talkers can be draining. Make sure to take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember that you can't change others, but you can change how you respond to them. By setting boundaries, practicing active listening, and asserting yourself, you can navigate conversations with nonstop talkers more effectively."

    "sentence": "So  one of my friends, Luke, has a beach house and before school let out,  he talked about invited all 8 of our friend group down one week this summer to go stay  there. Yesterday morning, I was surprised to see a few of my friends  posting pictures on social media at the beach house. To be honest I was  kind of hurt because nobody told me about it or even mentioned it and we  had all hung out a couple ago. I texted my best friend John who was  there if he knew why I wasn't invited and he told me the following.\n\nLuke  was calling everyone last week to invite us, and he called another  friend Chris before me. When Chris asked his parents if he could go,  they said he could only go if I'm not there. When asked why, they said  that I was a bad influence and they didn't want Chris around me far away  when we would be largely unsupervised. The reason they think this is  because we all got caught smoking weed at a camp-out a few months ago  and I took the fall because I was caught with it on me and there was no  point in dragging everyone else in. The cop didn't arrest me or anything  but they called all our parents and kicked us out of the campground. I  guess Chris told his parents the same thing even though I was just  saying it then because I thought we could get in legal trouble.\n\nSo  now Luke was put on the spot and had to either say, \"Ok, I won't invite  OP\" or uninvite Chris. I think the right thing to do would be to tell  Chris he can't dictate who he invites, but Luke doesn't like  confrontation so I think he thought it was easier to just agree and not  tell me about the trip.\n\nJohn told  me he was sorry and that he didn't know any of this until a couple days  ago right before we all hung out and he didn't know how to tell me. He  said he really didn't realize how fucked up it was until they all got  there and it kind of sank in that I really wasn't there. He offered to  come home and hang out with me for the week, but I told him it wasn't  his fault and he should enjoy himself and I was fine.\n\nI  don't know where to go from here though. I don't want to just pretend  that everything is cool when they get back because I think it's really  messed up to exclude me from this because of something I did for them.  I'm tempted to blow the whole thing up and send Chris's parents a  screenshot of texts between me thanking me for taking the fall that  night, but I'm not that petty and I want to get past that incident  anyway and don't want it brought up again. But I also don't want to be  excluded from things from now on either.

The other guy sounds like a solid friend.  \n\nMaybe you can work this out, but the other guys are the one’s who owe an apology and/or should make amends.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, that's a tough situation. It's understandable that you're hurt and feeling left out. I think it's great that you're considering not being petty and not wanting to bring up the past incident again.\n\nHere's what I would suggest: take some time to process your emotions and reflect on how you want to approach this situation. You could start by having an open and honest conversation with Luke and John when they get back. Let them know how you feel and express your disappointment that you weren't included. It's okay to be upset and share your feelings.\n\nHowever, I would caution against sending a screenshot of the texts to Chris's parents. That's not going to help the situation and could escalate things further. Instead, focus on having a constructive conversation with Luke and John about how you feel.\n\nIt might also be helpful to have a conversation with Chris about what his parents said and how it affected you. You could ask him if he's aware of how his parents' concerns might be perceived by others, and if he's willing to talk to them about it.\n\nIn terms of moving forward, you could suggest to Luke and John that you all catch up separately and plan a different trip or activity that you can all attend together. This way, you can still spend time with your friends and have a positive experience without feeling left out or excluded.\n\nRemember to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself during this time. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs, and it's not selfish to do so."

Local events: Attend concerts, festivals, or sporting events in your new area. These events can be great opportunities to meet new people with similar interests.\n7. Coworkers and colleagues: Leverage your professional network!

Be patient, be open-minded, and don't be discouraged if it takes a little while to find your tribe.\n\nIn your situation, since you have a one-bedroom friend coming with you, you might consider reaching out to local friends of friends or acquaintances from your current social circle to expand your network before moving.

You can say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed you seem a bit distant/ preoccupied lately. I want you to know I'm here for you and I care about what's going on.\"\n2. **Avoid being accusatory or pushy**: Refrain from saying things like \"What's wrong?\" or \"You're clearly upset, just tell me what's going on.\" This can come across as confrontational and might make them even more resistant to opening up.\n3. **Use open-ended questions**: Instead, ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. For example, \"How have you been feeling lately?\" or \"What's been on your mind?\" These types of questions can help them feel more comfortable sharing their concerns.\n4. **Listen actively**: When they do start talking, actively listen to what they're saying. Make eye contact, nod, and show empathy. Avoid interrupting or offering unsolicited advice.\n5. **Be patient**: It may take time for them to feel comfortable opening up. Don't push them to talk if they're not ready. Sometimes, people need space to process their emotions before they're willing to share.\n6. **Wait for a natural opening**: If they're not ready to talk, don't force the issue. Wait for a natural opening or a trigger that might encourage them to share more. This could be a change in their behavior, a comment they make, or a specific situation that arises.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize their comfort and trust. If they're not ready to talk, don't pressure them. Instead, continue to show your support and let them know you're there for them when they are ready to open up.\n\nIn terms of being persistent vs. waiting it out, I'd say it's a combination of both. Be patient and don't push them to talk, but also continue to show your interest and concern. Over time, they may come around and open up to you when they feel comfortable doing so."

For example: \"So, what I hear you saying is that you're feeling frustrated with [specific situation]?\"\n2. Open-ended questions: Ask questions that can't be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\". This encourages the speaker to share more details and insights.

I am quite open minded I think at last but I am physically hurting from it to the point I had to start pretending I am not because I don't know how to communicate this issue with him, or anyone.\n\nI am naturally very agreeable which translates to being very submissive in bed and saying \"no\" became a obstacle in my life in many ways getting me in weird or awkward situations.

It's okay to prioritize yourself and your needs. You deserve to feel heard, respected, and valued in your relationship."

However, when playing an instrument or singing, no matter how prepared I am, my heartbeat quickens, my palms get sweaty, my voice gets high-pitched and falters, and I get a huge adrenaline rush. \n\nAnyone know how to get rid of these symptoms? I'd rather be calm on stage.",
    "human": "You have two options:\n\nA) try deep breathing before going on stage.\n\nB) do what I did, and become a stage manager instead.",
    "base_reply": "The familiar feeling of performance anxiety! It's great that you're aware of it and willing to work on it. Overcoming stage fright as a musician can be a challenge, but with practice, patience, and the right strategies, you can learn to manage your nerves and perform with confidence.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's normal to feel some level of nervousness before a performance. It's your body's natural response to the pressure of being in the spotlight. However, it's essential to recognize that you're not alone, and many performers experience similar symptoms.\n\nTo help you overcome your symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: Make sure you're thoroughly rehearsed and comfortable with the material. The more prepared you are, the less likely you'll feel anxious. Practice regularly, and focus on perfecting your craft.\n2. **Breathe and relax**: Take deep breaths before and during the performance. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body.\n3. **Visualize success**: Imagine yourself performing confidently and successfully. Visualize the audience applauding, and focus on the feeling of accomplishment. This can help boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.\n4. **Get familiar with the space**: If possible, visit the performance venue before the actual show. Get a feel for the acoustics, the stage, and the audience. This can help you feel more comfortable and prepared.\n5. **Use positive self-talk**: Instead of focusing on your nerves, remind yourself that you're well-prepared and capable. Tell yourself that you've done this before and can do it again.\n6. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of viewing stage fright as a negative experience, try to see it as a natural response to the excitement and importance of the moment. Remember that it's a sign that you care about your performance and want to do your best.\n7. **Consider relaxation techniques**: Explore relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or guided imagery to help you manage your nerves. These can be especially helpful if you're someone who tends to get anxious in general.\n8. **Seek support**: Talk to other musicians or performers who have experienced stage fright. Sharing your concerns and hearing their stories can help you feel less alone and more connected.\n9. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment and what you're doing, rather than worrying about the future or past. Mindfulness can help you stay grounded and centered.\n10. **Celebrate small victories**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small successes, even if it's just a successful rehearsal or a positive feedback from a friend. This can help build your confidence and motivation.\n\nRemember, overcoming stage fright takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With consistent effort and the right strategies, you can learn to manage your nerves and perform with confidence."

Here's a tip: instead of focusing on trying to impress or being \"cool,\" focus on finding common ground and being yourself.\n\nWhen it comes to starting a conversation, try to find something you both have in common. It could be a class, a hobby, a TV show, or even a shared interest.

When I say constantly, I mean every day, sometimes multiple times a day.\nHe is not always like this, and certainly wasn’t as bad right at the beginning. He can be incredibly thoughtful, kind and loving, but there is another side to him that is like a monster. \n\nLet me start by saying that I have absolutely never cheated on my partner, and there have never been any instances where I have come even remotely close to doing so. \n\n- My boyfriend constantly questions me about males on my friend lists on social media, and is obsessed over whether I’ve slept with any of them. He will say things like ‘I know you’re talking to/meeting/sleeping with ____’ and does not accept anything I say to the contrary.\n\n- He goes back on my social media posts from years before we met, accusing me of sleeping with different men and saying I was seeking attention for doing things like thanking people for birthday wishes, or pressing ‘like’ on someone’s comment. For what it’s worth, I don’t post provocative photos or follow loads of random men.\n\n- He is obsessed with the number of people I have slept with prior to knowing him, despite him having slept with many many more. He questions me repeatedly about specific numbers during specific years and tells me I said different numbers before (I haven’t).\n\n- When we are out, he will accuse me of ‘looking at’ or ‘staring’ at men.  \n\n- If I don’t reply quickly enough to messages (within half an hour or sometimes less) he will blow up my phone with calls and texts saying that he ‘knows’ I’m with someone else.\n\n- I’ve fallen asleep on different occasions and woken up to unpleasant messages saying I am cheating etc.\n\n- if I go to the shop I get interrogated as to whether any men spoke to me or asked me for my number \n\n- He sometimes walks past my house to check I am in, or goes into pubs and bars trying to find me as he is convinced I’m there, even though I’ve said I’m in bed. I don’t even go to clubs anymore, and rarely go to bars. In any case, I’ve never lied about going somewhere so he has no reason to think I would do this. \n\n- He has tried to stop me from engaging in hobbies - learning French on an app (he thinks I can message other men on there, despite me showing that I can’t), swimming (there are male life guards) and going to the gym (he thinks I will talk to men there). There have been huge arguments when i have not given up these hobbies.\n\n- He will do things that seem crazy to me, like zooming in on photos I’ve sent him of what I’m doing and (wrongly) saying I’m with a man, or assuming I have cheated because I changed my bed sheets.\n\nWhenever I try and address the accusations he is out of control angry. Sometimes this scares me. Most of the time he will act like this in private, but in recent months it happens in public too. He has shouted at me in the street, calling me names like ‘b***h’ ‘sl*g’ ‘c*nt’ etc. Other people have intervened to ask if I was alright at times , and he will also shout at them. When I’ve cried I’m public he’s accused me of attention seeking and threatened random men walking past not to talk to me.\nOnce he went to headbutt me in a hotel room but stopped. Another time he punched me in the face in a busy street.\n\nHe always ‘switches’ back to being apologetic and promises to change, get help (I’ve asked him to see a therapist for the anger and paranoia) but it never happens. \nI’m so tired of walking on eggshells, not knowing what will set him off and when. I don’t feel like my behaviour is the issue because I don’t think I do things that are inappropriate.\nHe is talking about moving in together and having children in the future but I know there is no way I could do this while he remains so paranoid.\n\nI just don’t know what to do.

Does anyone have any advice?\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend constantly falsely accuses me of cheating - what can I do?Thanks everyone for the comments.\nI feel really stupid to be honest because I know if someone else described this situation to me I’d think they were insane for staying too.

He was quite reassuring and respectful of my position, and admitted he didn’t feel any differently and didn’t want kids. We agreed to revisit the topic over time, and agreed to both be open to changing our minds. \n\nSince then, I’ve started paying more attention to what future parenthood could entail. I’ve been reading articles, subreddits and searching my feelings at a leisurely pace and came to the conclusion that I, in 3-5 years, will definitely want to raise a child. Ideally, my husband’s child, but I accepted that my decision to raise a child may jeopardise our relationship. \n\nI decided to talk to him yesterday. I told him how I arrived at my position, to which he was very empathetic and empowering. \n\nI mentioned our relationship has never been stronger and grows each day, we’re both in individual therapy to address our anxiety and his depression, his changed anti-depressant medication has been working excellently for 6 months, his career is going well, I’m advancing in my career with a new job to start soon, we have no debt and are on a path to have a healthy savings and potential for buying a home. All of these pragmatic factors alongside an acceptance of how I believe becoming a parent would change my life, led me to my decision. \n\nHis response was measured and respectful, but I could tell this came as a bit of a shock to him. \n\nHe said he didn’t want kids, but he’d never ask me to change my mind at this point as he understands how important this decision is and thinks I arrived to it carefully and that I know what I want. He told me the choice is now his to leave me to find someone who doesn’t want kids, or to change his outlook and learn to accept and want a child too so that he could stay in our marriage. \n\nHe told me he loves me far too much to leave me for someone who doesn’t want any children, and that he’s willing to have ongoing discussions and wants us to work together to enhance the circumstances for him to want to have a child. As in, he wants to have time to work on himself and accept this change of course and to be better equipped to be a father. That today he doesn’t want a child, but he will work to want a child so that he can “give me what I want” because what I want is what he wants. \n\nHe also asks that I accept that if over time he still feels the way he feels today, he will need more time and couldn’t bring a child into the world at that stage. He wouldn’t string me along, or waste my time (biological clock ticking etc) so I respect this position. \n\nBut I’ve read so many times that one parent can’t compromise for the other. One person can’t want a baby and the other not want one but have one anyway - it leads to resentment. Even if we can’t see it today, or a year into parenthood, if he’s not wanting this life he shouldn’t make such a massive sacrifice just to be with me. \n\nSo what do I do in my position? Of course I want him to change his mind! Of course I love that he loves me so much. But I keep wanting to feel relieved, to feel joy that one day he and I will have a child together, and then I stop myself and feel guilty and like this is unfair for him. \n\nApologies for my verbosity but this is just huge to me and I’m truly scared to take us in the wrong direction. I love my husband so deeply. \n\n*tl;dr: Husband doesn’t want to raise a child, but now I do.

Children require a joint effort from both parents, and resentment can indeed build if one person is forced to sacrifice their desires for the other.\n\nIn your husband's response, he's placed a significant burden on himself to change his feelings and adapt to your desire for a child. While it's admirable that he's willing to work on himself, it's crucial to recognize that this is a significant ask. He may not be able to change his feelings overnight, and it's essential to respect his boundaries and limitations.\n\nAs you weigh your options, consider the following:\n\n1. **Honesty and transparency**: Have an open and ongoing conversation with your husband about your feelings, desires, and concerns. Make sure you're both on the same page about what you're willing to compromise on and what you're not.\n2. **Mutual understanding**: Try to understand your husband's perspective and the reasons behind his reluctance to have children. Acknowledge his feelings and concerns, and work together to find common ground.\n3. **Respect his boundaries**: It's essential to respect your husband's boundaries and limitations. If, after a reasonable amount of time, he still doesn't feel ready or willing to become a parent, it may be necessary to re-evaluate your decision to have a child.\n4. **Explore alternatives**: If your husband is unwilling to change his mind, you may need to consider alternative options, such as co-parenting or exploring adoption.\n5. **Prioritize your relationship**: Remember that your relationship with your husband is the foundation of your future together. Make sure you're not sacrificing your own happiness and well-being for the sake of having a child.\n\nIn the end, it's crucial to prioritize honesty, communication, and mutual respect in your decision-making process. It's not about one person getting what they want; it's about finding a compromise that works for both of you and sets you both up for a healthy, fulfilling life together.\n\nTake your time, and don't rush into any decisions. Remember to prioritize your own emotional well-being and the well-being of your relationship."

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Letting go of stuff can be tough, but it's amazing how freeing it can be once you get the hang of it.\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's okay to acknowledge the emotional attachment you have to certain items. It's natural to feel sentimental about things that hold memories or significance. However, it's essential to strike a balance between keeping meaningful items and holding onto unnecessary clutter.\n\nHere's a simple exercise to help you get started:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a tiny area, like your desk or a single shelf. This will help you focus on one area at a time and make the task less overwhelming.\n2. **Categorize items**: Group similar items together (e.g., all papers, all books, all decorative items). This will help you see what you have and make decisions easier.\n3. **Ask yourself questions**: For each item, ask:\n\t* When was the last time I used this?\n\t* Do I have a specific plan or intention for using it in the future?\n\t* Would I miss it if it were gone?\n\t* Can I replace it if I need it again?\n\t* Would someone else benefit from having it?\n4. **Create a \"maybe\" box**: For items that are difficult to decide on, put them in a \"maybe\" box and set a deadline, say 6 months, to revisit the item. If you haven't used or thought about it by then, it's likely you can let it go.\n5. **Let go of duplicates**: If you have multiple items that serve the same purpose, consider keeping only your favorite or the one in the best condition.\n6. **Consider the 1-in-1-out rule**: For every new item you bring into your space, get rid of an old one to maintain a balanced amount of possessions.\n7. **Find alternative solutions**: Instead of keeping items \"just in case,\" consider alternative solutions, like:\n\t* Digitizing documents or photos\n\t* Creating a backup system for important items\n\t* Donating or lending items to others\n8. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that letting go of items is a process. Be kind to yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.\n9. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories along the way. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue the decluttering process.\n10. **Seek support**: Consider enlisting the help of a friend or family member to keep you accountable and provide moral support.\n\nRemember, becoming a minimalist is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Start with small changes, and as you get more comfortable, you'll find it easier to let go of the things that no longer serve you.\n\nLastly, don't worry too much about the environmental impact of getting rid of non-donatable items. You can still find responsible ways to dispose of them, such as recycling or repurposing them.\n\nYou got this!"

    "base_reply": "Firstly, congratulations on having a stable job and being responsible with your finances!\n\nTo improve your credit score, I'd recommend taking a closer look at your credit report and understanding what's impacting it. You can request a copy of your report from the three main credit reference agencies in the UK (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) and review it carefully.\n\nHere are some specific actions you can take to improve your credit score:\n\n1. **Check for errors**: Make sure there are no errors or inaccuracies on your report. If you find any, dispute them with the relevant agency and get them corrected.\n2. **Pay bills on time**: Ensure you're paying your phone bill, credit card, and other debts on time. Late payments can significantly harm your credit score.\n3. **Keep credit utilization low**: Keep your credit utilization ratio below 30% for each credit account and overall. For example, if you have a credit limit of £1,000, try to keep your balance below £300.\n4. **Don't apply for too much credit**: Avoid applying for multiple credit cards or loans in a short period, as this can raise red flags with lenders. Only apply for credit when necessary, and space out your applications if you need to.\n5. **Consider a secured credit card**: If you're struggling to get approved for a regular credit card, consider a secured credit card. This can help you establish or rebuild credit.\n6. **Make on-time payments with your dad's business**: As you're working with your dad's business, make sure you're making timely payments on any business-related debts or expenses. This can help demonstrate your creditworthiness.\n7. **Monitor your credit utilization on your car loan**: Keep your car loan payments on track and try to keep your utilization ratio low. A high utilization ratio on your car loan can negatively impact your credit score.\n8. **Avoid negative marks**: Avoid any negative marks on your credit report, such as defaults, late payments, or collections. These can significantly lower your credit score.\n\nRemember, improving your credit score takes time and effort. Focus on making consistent, responsible financial decisions, and your credit score will likely improve over time.\n\nLastly, consider speaking with a financial advisor or credit expert for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. They can help you create a customized plan to improve your credit score and achieve your long-term financial goals."

Instead, ask shorter, more specific questions that encourage a quick response. This will help keep the conversation flowing.\n2. **Use emojis and tone indicators**: Emojis can be a great way to convey tone and add personality to your texts. Use them to soften the tone of your messages and make them more friendly. For example, a 😊 or a 😄 can help lighten the mood.\n3. **Avoid awkward silences**: You're right that awkward silences can be tough to navigate in person, but in texting, they can be especially awkward. Try to keep the conversation moving by asking a follow-up question or sharing a thought or experience.\n4. **Find common ground**: Texting conversations often benefit from a shared interest or experience. Try to find something you both have in common and use that as a conversation starter.\n5. **Don't overthink it**: Remember that texting is a more casual form of communication. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to be witty or clever. Just be yourself and respond naturally.\n6. **Keep it light**: Texting conversations are often more casual than in-person conversations. Don't feel like you need to delve into deep, meaningful topics right away. Start with lighter topics and see where the conversation takes you.\n7. **Use humor**: You mentioned that you might make a joke to break the ice in an in-person conversation. You can do the same in texting! Just be mindful of the tone and make sure your jokes won't come across as awkward or forced.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use these tips in a conversation:\n\nYou: \"Hey, how was your weekend?\"\nFriend: \"It was good, just hung out with family. How about you?\"\nYou: \"Same here! We had a nice dinner. Did you see that new show on Netflix?\"\nFriend: \"Yeah, I've been meaning to check it out. What's it like?\"\nYou: \"It's really good! I'm only on episode 3, but it's got me hooked. 😄\"\n\nRemember, the key is to be yourself, keep it concise, and use emojis to add tone and personality.

When we got together in Feb 2017 we were both young and my gf didn’t visit my family much as she said she was anxious / nervous around new people. My partner did visit, just not regularly and it took a while for her to gather the courage to visit.\n\nI had plans to go to university. I was accepted to uni but then had decided to defer a year and travel to Australia with my partner. Admittedly this was a very off the cuff plan. My mum wanted to meet her and sit down for a chat to understand her plans over there and the general situation as to why I wanted to defer from uni. I can’t particularly remember the details but I don’t think my gf visited my family before leaving to go to aus. She left in Sep 2017 and ended up returning in November as she missed her family and I.\n\nDecember 2017, my partner and I moved out into staff accommodation. There were still the grumblings of ‘why doesn’t she want to come and visit ect’. \n\nFast forward to March 2018, we discovered my partner was pregnant with twins. At the age of 20 this was obviously a shock to us both.\nMy mum was of the opinion that we would be silly to continue with the pregnancy because we were so young and were going to throw so much away.\n\nThere was a meeting that was arranged between my mum, step dad, gf and her mum, this went down like a lead balloon and ended in an argument between my gf and step-dad over him saying she was acting spoiled. I fell out with him as he was completely in the wrong for these comments.\nThroughout the pregnancy there were comments from my mum that hurt my gf and offended her. At the time I was indifferent because deep down I did not want to have children but I recognise I did not do enough to protect my partner and I failed her.\n\nUnfortunately, my partner had a miscarriage and there was a distinct lack of communication between my my family and my partner. E.g. my mum bought flowers but left them at her house for me to collect. This understandably led to my gf feeling hurt and disrespected.\n\nThis has compounded for the last 4 years to a point at which I know I am not spending enough time with my family as I should be and I feel so guilty for it. My grandparents are getting older and I don’t want to one day regret not seeing them enough because of this situation.\n\nThe problem is, my gf is not willing to sort this out. She is of the opinion that she does not want to see nor speak with my family. My mum keeps asking me to arrange to meet with just my gf and her so we can lay everything on the table and be honest about our feelings but my gf doesn’t want to.\n\nWe are looking to move to a city 2.5 hours away in the next couple of months for work and my gf is saying that my family are not welcome in the house. When she gets angry she also makes rude comments about my mum which makes me uncomfortable but I can’t get angry because I know she feels disrespected.\nMy gf recently lost her grandfather and my mum wasn’t even going to send a text to say sorry until I asked her to. I told my gf that my mum said this. I regret saying that but felt I should be honest.\n\nI am really struggling to juggle this situation, I do not want to choose to see my family less like they keep telling me I will be doing by staying with her. I also do not want to split up with my gf. I feel incredibly stuck.\n\nI need help and don’t know where else to turn.\n\nThank you.\n\nTL;DR! GF has avoided meeting family since we got together 6 years ago. Had a miscarriage and problems have compounded since as my gf feels she was disrespected by mum. Now in a difficult situation as I want to resolve things but don’t know how.Just asked my gf if she would speak to my mum and got an angry phone call saying that I don’t respect her. ‘You are no kind of a man rn’ and ‘you’re pathetic and need to tell your mum that I am not in the headspace to speak to her at the moment’. \n\nI am sorry for venting all of this but I genuinely have nowhere to turn.I’ve just got to say. Thank you to everyone that has commented, positive or negative. Even if I haven’t replied to your comment please be aware that I have read through all 100+ of them and take your opinions very seriously.\n\nI will be booking an initial appointment with a therapist, will also be speaking with both my mum and partner separately to try and set boundaries and possibly resolve the situation.\n\nThank you again, I really appreciate it!",

They can help distract you, provide support, or even take some of the social pressure off you.\n4. **Focus on others**: Instead of worrying about yourself, try to genuinely engage with others. Ask questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest in their lives. This can help shift your focus away from your own anxiety.\n5. **Take breaks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it's okay to excuse yourself for a few minutes. Take some fresh air, do some deep breathing exercises, or step away to collect your thoughts.\n6. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regularly practicing relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing can help reduce overall anxiety levels. This can make it easier to handle group situations.\n7. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative self-talk by reframing your thoughts. Instead of \"I'm a failure for being anxious,\" try \"I'm feeling anxious, but that's okay. I can handle it.\"\n8. **Seek professional help**: If your social anxiety is impacting your daily life or causing significant distress, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide personalized guidance and support.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it may take time to build up your comfort level. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being.

Her only compromise here is 'Don't go', whereas you have many other options.\n\nIf her having to prioritize her work is a deal breaker for you, then it is. But I totally see where she is coming from here.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's natural to feel disappointed and a bit hurt when you feel like you're not being prioritized in the relationship. It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and taking the time to process them.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your girlfriend did apologize and explained her situation. It's not like she's blowing you off completely. It's also understandable that she's new to her job and wants to make a good impression.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to recognize that relationships are about give-and-take. It's not always 50/50, but it's about finding a balance. You're right that you might be the one giving more in this situation, but that doesn't mean you're wrong for feeling hurt.\n\nRather than dwelling on this one instance, maybe take some time to reflect on the bigger picture of your relationship. Are there other times when she's been there for you and supported you? Are there other ways she shows her love and appreciation for you?\n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, \"Hey, I felt a bit disappointed when you couldn't be there to celebrate my achievement with me. I understand that your work party is important, but it would mean a lot to me if you could find a way to prioritize our relationship sometimes too.\"\n\nRemember, relationships are a journey, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Communication and empathy are key to working through these issues and growing together."

However, it's essential to consider the overall financial implications of buying a car, especially since your grandfather is willing to put up the money.\n\nHere are a few things to think about:\n\n1. **Opportunity cost**: With your grandfather's offer, you won't have to worry about saving up for a car, which means you'll have more funds available for college-related expenses, such as tuition, books, and living costs. This could be a significant advantage.\n2. **Depreciation and maintenance**: Cars depreciate quickly, and you'll need to consider ongoing maintenance costs, insurance, and fuel expenses. These can add up quickly, and you'll want to make sure you're prepared to cover these costs.\n3. **Alternative transportation options**: Since you're attending college near August 2018, you might want to explore alternative transportation options, such as public transportation, carpooling, or ride-sharing services.

If you can make a responsible plan for owning and maintaining the car, and you're confident you can cover the costs, then it might be a good option.

To be clear she NEVER yelled at me and my brother before this. Like I literally cannot remember her yelling at me until two years ago when I was 15.\n\n4 years ago they divorced and she introduced me and my brother to her new bf, which I could tell my dad didn't like because she didn't discuss it with him first and I'm perceptive so I can tell, and then her and her bf split. And then it was chill for ages, my brother and I spent alternate weeks with each parent and they seemed to get along well. Then my mom got another boyfriend (who was the worst) and introduced us and then they broke up. During this whole time they never fought in front of us and I thought they were both handling it well. I loved spending time with each of them for different reasons because me and my brother got to see both our parents and they coordinated the time well and we never had to see fighting.\n\n2 years or so ago my dad told us he was seeing someone and he introduced us a few months after that and we really liked her. My brother LOVES my dad's gf, he'd been pestering my dad about dating for ages ever since the divorce and my brother was so excited when he met her. She's super cool. She feels like a mix between a cousin and an aunt because she's way chiller than our parents but also responsible. She started hanging out with us a lot. I do nails and tv and talk a lot with her and she does sports with both of us. She also helps us with our homework, more my brother because I don't really need help, and she has been giving me advice about college apps because I'm a junior. She's been teaching me how to drive.\n\nAround this time my mom started getting mad at everything. I came home with kinda complex braids and I said that my dad's gf, I'll call her Kate so it's easier to read, did them while I was watching TV. And then I heard my mom call my dad on the phone and yell at him. This is when I was like 15. And my brother is not good at reading emotions so he'd always bring up Kate and things she did with us or bought for us and every single time he did it my mom would find a reason to pick a fight with me. Not my brother, ME. Even if I wasn't doing anything. My brother is an idiot but I love him and when I told him not to mention Kate anymore he tried to stop but sometimes it comes up. Like if mom asks what we did last week and we mention going to a museum and then she asks who took us, we have to eventually mention Kate. The problem is I'm the one who gets in trouble. She'll start yelling about a book I left out or something stupid and small that she wouldn't usually yell about. I'm in therapy (although I haven't been in a while) and I asked my mom to get therapy but she got mad at me. I'm frustrated. We used to be so close.\n\nNow my dad and Kate are talking about getting a new apartment so they can live together and get married and I'm totally cool with it. She practically lives here anyway and it's too small for me my dad Kate my brother and a dog. And she has a cat she's bringing.\n\nAnyway when my mom found out they were going to move in together she freaked out and grounded me even though I didn't do anything. She did the same thing when I said Kate was teaching me how to drive. So now it's like on mom weeks I'm in prison and on dad weeks I get to live. I do better in school when I'm with dad and Kate because they help me with homework when I need help and they leave me alone when I need to be alone and they take me to concerts and teach me how to play poker and shit like that, but with my mom it's like she's always trying to make me do the opposite of whatever is productive for me in that moment. She's driving me crazy.\n\nShe said something when we fought last week about changing the custody agreement and I know I'm old enough to choose for myself but I don't want to be split up from my brother because I want to live at home for senior year and freshman year of college and I know my brother does better when his living situation is synced up with mine. He's kind of shy and he isn't great at school and socializing with his peers but I take him out with me and my friends (within reason, I don't take him to big HS parties but if we're all going to dinner I invite him and he comes like half the time.) My friends love him and they gas him up and he gets so confident and funny when he's around us. I don't want to leave him. I just want my mom to stop being crazy and mad at me all the time and I want it to go back to the way it was.\n\nShe's going back to court for a custody battle because she found out Kate talked to me about sex and she thinks that's not Kate's place, so I'm scared that she might get full custody of my brother. I want shared custody with alternating weeks like it's been for 4 years.\n\nSorry this is so long   \n\nTLDR my mom gets weird and angry when my dad's gf gets brought up but we can't not bring her up because she hangs out with us so much.

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and the complexities that come with having an adopted sibling who's been through challenges. It's great that you're seeking guidance to navigate this situation.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your sister's attachment to you might be a result of her past experiences, including being adopted at a young age and possibly feeling uncertain about her sense of belonging. This attachment can manifest in different ways, including clinginess.\n\nWhen it comes to situations like the ones you mentioned, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Public clinginess: When your sister clings to you in public and hides behind you when someone speaks to her, try to remain patient and understanding. It might be helpful to gently and calmly encourage her to take a few steps back, giving her space to breathe and feel more comfortable. You can say something like, \"Hey, sis, I know it can be scary, but it's okay to talk to people. I'm right here with you, and we can face this together.\" If she's not ready to separate, it's okay to let her stay close, but try to find a balance that works for both of you.\n2. Gaming and staring: When she sits and stares at you while you're gaming, it might be helpful to acknowledge her presence and let her know you're happy to have her around. You can say, \"Hey, sis, I'm glad you're here. Do you want to join me in the game, or would you rather do something else?\" This way, you're giving her an opportunity to engage or step back, depending on her comfort level.\n3. Sleeping in your bed: As for sleeping in your bed, it's essential to consider your own boundaries and comfort level. If you're not comfortable sharing your bed with your sister, it's okay to set a boundary. You can say, \"Hey, sis, I love having you around, but I need some personal space. How about we find a different sleeping arrangement that works for both of us?\" If you're willing to accommodate her, make sure to establish clear boundaries and discuss what that means for both of you.\n\nSome general tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Be patient and understanding. Your sister's attachment and clinginess might be a result of her past experiences, and it may take time to work through these feelings.\n* Communicate openly and honestly with your sister. Let her know how you're feeling and what you need from her.\n* Set boundaries and be consistent. It's essential to establish clear boundaries and expectations to help your sister feel secure and understood.\n* Seek support for yourself. Having an attached and clingy sibling can be challenging, so don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance.\n\nRemember, every situation is unique, and it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being while also being understanding and supportive of your sister's needs."

I feel like this topic comes up a lot here so I apologize for the rambling. But this has reached a point for me where it is having a serious impact on my mental and emotional health. Mainly because as I start to think of dealing with it long term, it becomes hard and harder to see that as being possible. Which brings up questions of how do I keep this thing from truly ruining and ending a marriage?\n\nI guess I am mostly to blame for this. I let the issue go on for too long. There were always signs of my wife's lack of desire for sex. From never really wanting to initiate to even being very uncomfortable even joking about or talking about sex. I am also truly upset at myself for being the one who clearly cares more about it. Letting it have this level of impact on me seems so stupid. But it's a hard thing for me to ignore at this point.\n\nWe've been together for 7 years. Married for 2. In the beginning, our sex life was just good. It was frequent. Especially when we didn't live together.\n\nBut once we moved in things noticeably changed or maybe being together more frequently made things more noticeable. She initiated less and less. Even often interrupting moments when I was trying to initiate (like saying she needed to take the dog out or shower while we're on the couch and I was making and move - and= when she was done she'd head straight to bed and never returning to whatever moment we were just having). It got so noticeable it caused me to initiate less because I felt slightly uncomfortable or worried that I'd put myself out there and she just reject it. This was something I brought up before and there were promises to be better but that never really happened.\n\nI also started to notice that she doesn't even seem comfortable talking about sex with me. Even making disgusted faces at just jokes about it. I never thought much of it at first but given everything else, it started to make me wonder if she doesn't like sex, or like sex with me.\n\nWhen we do have sex it has become so routine. Not sure we've had sex before 9 PM in years. Never try new things. I tried introducing or suggesting toys or games but that went ignored or again, disgusted reaction.\n\nThe last 2 years or so have been a struggle more than ever. We're down to sex *maybe* 2 times per month. I also started to notice that it seems like at this point 8 out of 10 times we do have sex she needs to have been drinking first\n\nI don't know what to make of it. She hinted at a lower libido recently but that doesn't seem to explain it because it isn't something that suddenly started. And why, if that was the case, bring it up now when it is clearly something affecting our marriage. I've made it known already that lack of sex has had an emotional impact on me. Yet nothing from her has changed. Given the drinking thing, I can't help but feel like it's due to a lack of attraction. Or maybe she has other means to satisfy herself. I don't know at this point.\n\nI should note that my libido has risen slightly in the last year or so due to medication I started taking which has made things even more difficult. It just feels like such a ridiculous thing to let cause a wedge in a relationship but at the same time sex can be such an important part of a relationship. It certainly is for me. I should have realized a lot of this sooner so there isn't anyone else to blame. So how exactly does one solve a situation where one partner just clearly doesn't care about sex the same way or have the same desire for it? What steps should I take? I literally at this point have started looking up libido-lowering supplements of medication because I hate how this whole thing is impacting my relationship but at what point is that futile?\n\nTLDR: My wife and I have an ever more noticeable differ in sex drive that is starting to show in our marriage and I am not sure what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDidn't expect this to blow up. But to summarize some responses to comments I saw:\n\n**Comments about her enjoyment of sex -** My impression is she does enjoy it and I do things before/after to make sure she orgasms almost every time we have sex. \n\n**Comments about showing affection without expectation of sex -** I do this ALL the time. It is another thing that has actually come to bother me but I kept it out of this post. I am pretty much the only one who initiates non-sexual hugs, kisses, snuggles, compliments, etc. Maybe it is another sign of her lack of attraction or aversion to a physical connection with me that I just have ignored for so long. But outside of a kiss goodnight of the occasional compliment, she shows very little outward affection.\n\n**\"Women aren’t attracted to and do not want to have sex with the people they are taking care of in a maternal manner.\" -** It is actually the opposite in this case. I provide 100% financially for our shared finances, our chores are split about 80%/20% (me doing the 80%), I take care of all bills, groceries, etc. and I have to plan practically everything (trips, meals, what we are watching). Not because I am controlling but because the expectation has fallen on me. Otherwise, a lot of it wouldn't get done.  I am also the only one who does things like gets random gifts/surprises or try to make the other feel better when they are sad or just for fun. Massages.

My partner has learned that instead of hinting about lack of sex, he needs to start telling me what a great butt I have and how fantastic I look in that outfit.  An occasional nibble on the neck (with no expectation of it leading to anything) and tell me I smell good.  These things put me in the mood, maybe not RIGHT THAT SECOND, but it pays off for him I promise.  \n\nMaybe in the beginning you were more complimentary.

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're taking the time to reflect on your situation and seeking advice. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and hurt by the lack of intimacy in your relationship. I'll try to provide some guidance, but please keep in mind that every situation is unique, and what works for one couple may not work for another.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle. Many couples face issues with sexual desire and intimacy, and it's not uncommon for one partner to have a lower libido than the other.\n\nRegarding your concerns about your wife's lack of desire for sex, it's possible that she may not be experiencing the same level of attraction or intimacy that you are. It's crucial to remember that people's desires and needs can change over time, and it's not uncommon for women to experience a decrease in libido during certain life stages or due to various factors such as stress, hormonal changes, or personal issues.\n\nGiven your wife's discomfort with talking about sex and her reactions to your attempts to initiate conversations, it's possible that she may not be comfortable with the topic or may be avoiding it due to feelings of guilt, shame, or embarrassment. It's essential to approach this topic with empathy and understanding, rather than blame or accusation.\n\nIn terms of how to move forward, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings and concerns. Avoid blaming or accusing language, and focus on expressing your own emotions and needs. Use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel, rather than \"you\" statements that can come across as accusatory.\n2. Explore the possibility that your wife's lack of desire for sex may not be about you or your relationship, but rather about her own personal struggles or issues. Avoid taking it personally and try to understand her perspective.\n3. Consider seeking couples therapy or counseling to work through these issues together. A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to the lack of intimacy in your relationship.\n4. Don't assume that your wife's lack of desire for sex is a reflection of her feelings for you or your relationship. It's possible that she still has strong feelings for you, but may be struggling with her own desires and needs.\n5. Focus on building intimacy and connection in other ways, such as through emotional support, shared activities, and other forms of affection. This can help you both feel more connected and fulfilled, even if sex is not a regular part of your relationship.\n\nRemember that relationships are a two-way street, and it's essential to work together to find a solution that works for both partners. Avoid putting too much pressure on your wife to \"fix\" the issue or meet your needs, and instead focus on finding ways to build a stronger, more intimate connection.\n\nRegarding your concerns about libido-lowering supplements or medication, I would advise against using these as a solution to your problems. Instead, focus on addressing the underlying issues in your relationship and working towards building a stronger, more intimate connection with your wife."

If her friend is not planning to tell him anytime soon, it's possible that the husband might find out through other means, or worse, continue to be hurt and betrayed without knowing what's going on.\n\nOn the other hand, if you and your wife decide to tell him, it could potentially lead to some difficult conversations and potentially strain your relationships with both the husband and the cheating friend. But, it's also possible that it could lead to a more honest and open relationship with the husband, and potentially even a stronger bond with your wife.\n\nIt's also important to consider your wife's feelings in this situation. If she's already aware of the situation and is struggling with it, keeping the secret could be putting her in an even more difficult position. You could have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and get her input on what she thinks would be best for her and her friendship.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but I would encourage you to prioritize honesty and transparency. It's not always easy, but it's often the best way to build trust and maintain healthy relationships in the long run."

    "sentence": "I (23m) have been with my GF (21f) for almost 1.5 year now, but because of university/work obligations we're still not living together. That of course doesn't stop us from visiting each other often, even going for trips together (gonna do that even next week), and the plan is to live together next year after I graduate.\n\nNow I have no idea how to describe the way she cares about us and wants us to be together because words can't possibly do it. She's the kindest person ever, does everything for me (well, almost, but we'll get to that) and I truly feel like she's the one. The problem is our sex life though; before meeting her I was a virgin so I was not experienced whatsoever. In order not to make a disaster out of my first time with her I've watched so many videos and read so many texts on how to make sure that women are satisfied, and it was really worth it because up to this point we've spent so many nights together now and she always tells me how incredibly good I make her feel.\n\nThe problem that I have though is that I don't necessarily feel this way and things are getting a bit stale for me. Other than cuddling and kissing we just have sex and that's it, and I've expressed how I'd like to try something new sometimes (and one time was a disaster, I'll get to that later), but the problem is that it's not possible apparently. When she tries to give me a blowjob it's just not enjoyable whatsoever as her mouth is too small for my dick and I feel like her teeth are killing it, and even if we're doing it then she gags which doesn't make me feel good about the situation. When I come inside her mouth, she immediately runs to bathroom to spit it out, which also makes me feel a bit weird. Even handjob isn't good because dunno, I don't even get close. One night I really wanted to try anal with her, but she said that \"she's sure it would be a disaster because she's tried that once and doesn't want to again\", and arguments like \"I'd be incredibly gentle, we'd look for information online on how to do it in a painless way\" etc etc but nothing works. When she had period and I was really horny that night, I kept telling her that I'd really like to have sex with her once when she's on period, just to try and see if we'd like it (and if not - we forget about this topic). She said that she's never done it and is never ever gonna do it because blood disgusts her and even when he's showering she puts a tampoon inside (again, I proposed so many ideas; doing it on a red/black towel, with lights off, in the shower etc. but nothing works). It upsets me a bit because we're not able to be every single day/night together yet, and sometimes when we meet after a long break and I can't even have sex with her because of period it's just sad since there's no other way for her to satisfy me. And even the sex is not IDEAL because of condoms since she can't take pills due to health problems.\n\nI know that the answer that you'll give me is just \"talk to her, tell her everything that you wrote her\" but it's not easy because of one situation we had recently. When she was on her period and didn't want to do anything, I expressed that it upsets me that she doesn't want to try anal because of some bad experience in the past that wasn't even with me and now I'm basically paying for it, and that she tried anal with him but she doesn't even want to try having sex on period with me. I kinda raised my voice during that moment, she started crying and was actually packing to leave, but I stopped her and apologized. Since that time, I'm just afraid to mention these topics to her, and I know that saying the truth that.. I'm not really getting satisfied often in bed would just crush her. Very often when we'd cuddle after sex she'd just suddenly start crying and apoligizing that she can't make me feel as good as I make her feel, that she's a disaster etc. but I'd always make her feel better with my words by saying that it's not a problem, but I'm starting to feel like it could be.

At first, I was stoked about the amount of \"freedom\" I would have in my job, as I'm the only one in the office about 80+% of the time. But over time, I've found it to be a surprisingly large problem. I don't find the work engaging, and my office environment provides minimal stimulation.

This made me very upset since I've never indicated I would some day reconsider my decision to not have children. At that time we had already started planning a vacation in August in another country (we'll be hiking and have both spend a lot of money on new gear and are both super excited about going) so we decided to not make any decisions regarding our relationship until after the vacation.

He has told me that he can't imagine being with anybody else (and neither can I) which makes it even more heartbreaking. \nWould it be fair to \"demand\" an answer before the vacation, or should I give him some time and wait as we agreed? \n\n(Sorry for my broken English, I'm not a native speaker) \n\nEdit: some of you are wondering why I can’t have biologial children.

    "base_reply": "I'm so glad you found the responses helpful!\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're finding it difficult to wait for his decision, especially given the uncertainty and potential impact on your future together. It's natural to feel anxious about the unknown.\n\nRegarding your question, I think it's essential to consider the agreement you both made to not discuss it further until after the vacation. You've already given him space and time to think about it, and he's promised to make a decision when you return. It might be challenging to \"demand\" an answer before the vacation, as that could put pressure on him and potentially damage your relationship.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on having an open and honest conversation with him when you return. You could express your feelings and concerns about the uncertainty, and ask him to share his thoughts and feelings about what he's thinking. This might help you both get on the same page and understand each other's perspectives better.\n\nIt's also crucial to remember that you've already been open and honest with him about your decision not to have biological children. You've shared your reasons, and he initially accepted that. It's understandable that his perspective has changed, but it's essential to acknowledge that your decision hasn't changed.\n\nIn the meantime, try to focus on the things you can control, like your own feelings and reactions. It might be helpful to remind yourself that you've made a decision that's right for you, and that you're not willing to compromise on something that's essential to your well-being.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and understanding. If he ultimately decides that having children is a dealbreaker, it might be a sign that you're not compatible in the long run. On the other hand, if he's willing to accept your decision, it could be a sign that he values your relationship and is willing to work with you.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that you're not alone in this situation. There are many people who have made the decision to be child-free, and it's a valid choice. You've taken control of your body and made a decision that's right for you. Don't forget to prioritize your own well-being and happiness in this situation.\n\nKeep in mind that you're already taking steps to prioritize your own needs and desires, and that's something to be proud of. Whatever the outcome, remember that you're strong, capable, and deserving of a fulfilling relationship."

I'm happy to help you explore your options.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to clarify that it's generally not possible to transfer the balance from a prepaid debit card to a traditional bank account. Prepaid cards are designed for a specific purpose and have specific restrictions.\n\nHowever, there are a few alternatives you could consider:\n\n1. **Gift cards:** As you mentioned, buying Amazon gift cards or similar rewards cards can be a good option. You can use the prepaid card to purchase these gift cards, and then use them to make purchases online or in-store. You'll get the cashback rewards, and the gift cards won't expire.\n2. **Cashback apps:** You can also use the prepaid card to earn cashback rewards through apps like Ibotta, Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), or Fetch Rewards. These apps offer cashback on certain purchases, and you can redeem the rewards for real cash.\n3. **Charity donations:** If you're unable to find a use for the prepaid card balance, you could consider donating it to a charity. Many charities accept donations via prepaid cards, and you'll receive a tax deduction for your donation.\n4. **Dispose of it responsibly:** If none of the above options appeal to you, you could simply dispose of the prepaid card responsibly. Make sure to follow the instructions provided by the card issuer to properly cancel the card and notify them of its expiration.\n\nBefore making a decision, take a moment to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Consider your financial goals, spending habits, and the benefits of each alternative.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your financial well-being and avoid using the prepaid card for unnecessary purchases or transactions that might lead to overspending.\n\nWhich option do you think might be the best fit for you?"

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Social anxiety can definitely make conversations feel daunting, and it's completely normal to feel stuck sometimes. Here's the thing: you don't have to be a conversational virtuoso to have great chats. It's all about being genuine, curious, and willing to learn. Here are some tips to help you improve:\n\n1. **Prepare ahead of time**: Think about current events, popular books/movies, or common interests that you're passionate about. This can be a great conversation starter and help you feel more confident.\n2. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more about themselves. This shows you're interested and helps keep the conversation flowing.\n3. **Listen actively**: Sometimes, people just need someone to listen. Make eye contact, nod, and show you're engaged in the conversation. This can help you feel more connected and give you time to think of your next question or comment.\n4. **Find common ground**: Look for shared experiences, hobbies, or interests that can help bridge the gap and create a sense of connection.\n5. **Don't be too hard on yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have awkward silences or not know what to say. It's a normal part of conversation. Just take a deep breath, and try to relax. The other person might not even notice!\n6. **Practice active listening and responding**: When someone is talking, try to paraphrase what they said in your own words. This shows you're actively listening and can help you respond thoughtfully.\n7. **Take small steps**: Start small by practicing conversations with people you know, like friends or family members. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually work on conversations with new people.\n8. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key in conversations. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People are more likely to respond positively to someone who is genuine and honest.\n\nRemember, improving at conversations takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. With time and effort, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your conversations."

Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Join a club or group aligned with your interests**: This could be a book club, a sports team, a hiking group, or even an online community. When you're surrounded by people who share your passions, it's easier to find common ground and build meaningful connections.\n2. **Attend events specifically designed for introverts or non-partygoers**: Look for events like board game nights, language exchange meetups, or volunteer opportunities. These settings tend to be more low-key and focused on conversation.\n3. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, art class, or language course. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also have a structured environment to interact with others who share your interest.\n4. **Use online platforms to connect with others**: Join online forums, social media groups, or Reddit communities centered around your interests. This way, you can start building connections with people before meeting in person.\n5. **Be patient and persistent**: Building relationships takes time, especially if you're introverted or shy. Don't get discouraged if it takes a few attempts to find the right group or person. Keep showing up, and eventually, you'll find your tribe.\n\nTo avoid getting cut off when you do make a connection, try these tips:\n\n1. **Keep the conversation light and casual**: Avoid getting too deep or intense too quickly. Keep the conversation light and fun, and be willing to pivot if the other person's attention starts to wane.\n2. **Ask open-ended questions**: Encourage the other person to share more about themselves by asking open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n3. **Listen actively**: Show that you're genuinely interested in what the other person is saying by actively listening and asking follow-up questions.\n4. **Be respectful of boundaries**: If you sense that the other person is getting ready to leave or move on, don't push the conversation. Instead, thank them for chatting and wish them well.\n\nRemember, building relationships takes time and effort. Focus on being genuine, respectful, and open-minded, and you'll increase your chances of making meaningful connections with like-minded people."

He also has body dysmorphia and probably depression and will be seeing a therapist next week.\n\nBefore I got pregnant, we had some issues with how often we were intimate and this has seemed to resurface now. I had a vaginal delivery with a second degree tear two months ago, got an iud put in at 6 weeks and have been bleeding ever since. All of that on top of being the primary caregiver to our newborn son. My husband has a complicated relationship with our son - he doesn’t feel bonded to him and I believe is starting to resent him because I obviously have to give him most of my attention. He does help with caring for him by taking baths with him, changing diapers, a few bottlefeeds, coming with us to all his appointments, etc. He just hates the sound of his cries and thinks it means he will be a brat later in life. To be clear, our son is on the fussier side, doesn’t sleep through the night, etc. \n\nMy husband is very self-deprecating about his physical appearance, he will call himself ugly - sometime joking and other times seriously. He has been expressing frustration with our sex life recently since we obviously haven’t been able to have sex before 6 weeks pp. We were able to be intimate that week before I was cleared, just no penetrative sex. \n\nLast night the stars finally aligned and I was able to get baby down in his bassinet around 10pm. I tried to initiate sex by touching his body and kissing him but my husband wouldn’t even let me kiss him and then said it was too late at night and that he wanted to have PV sex but since I was bleeding, it wasn’t possible. To be clear, I have no issue with being intimate while bleeding so long as we put a towel down. This whole time I had to put his arms around me to get closer to him and he didn’t respond at all to me touching him. So being that I am very sleep-deprived I said ok and started getting ready to move baby to where we sleep. Well he decided that because I didn’t push further it must mean that I didn’t really want to have sex with him. I told him I’m not playing these stupid games, you said you didn’t want to have sex and I believed you. At that point I was so pissed that I was completely turned off so I took the baby and went to bed. He sent me a long text in the middle of night that he was done trying to have sex me and we would just be partners in raising our son. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I don’t know how to explain that our sex issues now are not the same as we had before I got pregnant. He wants me to do things a certain way but when I ask how he can’t explain it to me. He wants things to be more spontaneous but I literally can’t do that with a newborn.\n\nTL;DR - Husband said he won’t ask to have sex with me because I can’t convince him that I want to have sex.\n\nETA: I don’t think my husband resents our son, I just see some things that could lead to resentment if nothing changes. My husband is still mourning the loss of our old ‘life’ before baby, in no way do I think or does anyone in my family think he would ever harm our son. Despite his frustrations and not doing nighttime feedings, he has been very attentive.\n\nETAA: Any bleeding I have now is period/spotting blood, not from the tear.",

I'm here to offer you some honest and non-judgmental advice.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that your husband is struggling with the changes that come with having a new baby. His body dysmorphia and depression are likely contributing factors to his emotional state. It's great that he's seeking therapy, and I hope he'll be able to work through his issues with the help of a professional.\n\nRegarding your sex life, it's crucial to acknowledge that your circumstances have changed significantly since having a baby. You're right that spontaneity is challenging with a newborn, and it's not fair to expect you to be able to initiate sex whenever your husband wants. You're doing an incredible job caring for your son, and it's essential to prioritize your own physical and emotional well-being.\n\nWhen your husband said he wouldn't ask to have sex with you because he didn't think you wanted it, it's possible he was feeling frustrated and unheard. However, it's not okay for him to assume you're not interested in sex just because you didn't push the issue further. It's crucial to have open and honest communication about your desires and boundaries.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to initiate sex, you could have a calm and respectful conversation with your husband about your feelings and needs. You could say something like, \"Hey, I know things have been tough since the baby arrived, and I'm struggling to find the energy and intimacy we used to have. Can we talk about what we both need and want in terms of our relationship and sex life? I think it's essential we find a way to connect and prioritize our relationship, but I also need some understanding and support.\"\n\nIt's also important to set clear boundaries and communicate your needs to your husband. You could say, \"I understand you want to have sex, but I'm not in a place where I can do that right now. I need some time to focus on my own recovery and bonding with our son. Can we find other ways to connect and show affection, like holding hands or giving each other massages?\"\n\nRemember, your husband's struggles with body dysmorphia and depression are not your responsibility to fix. You can't force him to feel better or change his mindset, but you can support him by being understanding and patient. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're recognizing the potential for resentment if things don't change. It's essential to address these issues and work together as a team to find a solution that works for both of you."

Before that it was wonderful, he was so caring and we just clicked so well. It was amazing in general. We decided to keep the child. Thats when things took a turn.\n\nFirst was accusing me of sleeping around and child wasn't his, ( i was exclusively dating him since we met) then him suddenly turning super cold and not communicating well. He created this reality that i was never pregnant, or when id bring it up the 'child wasn't his' so he never took responsibility. Finally when I started 'showing', I had to run to my mum for help and handle the pregnancy mostly on my own while he watched from afar, overworking and doing his own thing.\n\nI clearly learnt it this way that he has terrible communication, lack of empathy (he says emotions are dramatic, stupid and unnecessary (I am a cry-er especially at home) although he says he 'loves me'. He was not like the man I met, in fact the complete opposite. Finally I delivered the child and he was really happy, but I also was diagnosed with PPD (which I had therapy with). It went well in the first couple months until the 3rd month he demanded i get back to work when i was full time breastfeeding and had no help. That caused me so much stress taking care of my girl. I finally got back to work when she was 8 months and between those periods, when its going well, we get along like amazing friends and we have a loving relationship. When we argue, or sad about something (doesn't have to do with him) he invalidates me and ignores/stonewalls me. He'd also often complain or finds an excuse to get mad at me.\n\nHe is very inconsistent. One day or week he's in-love but the next day he could just ignore me for hours/days. Then he'd talk about long term plans like meeting his family, living somewhere else, getting married, etc. But he doesn't care when I'd cry or want to have deep conversations. At first i made excuses thinking its his introversion or awkwardness but now I don't know.\n\nAnother backstory on him:\n\n15 years ago, he had a child with his ex and she hated him so much she blocked him from seeing his son for the last 13 years. He'd never explain why, he just says she's unstable. But somewhat I'm starting to understand her. Her not letting him see his son is bad and I don't want to do that to him and he doesn't ever want it to happen again. He loves our baby so much and is fully committed to raising her.\n\nI've left him couple times but he wouldn't let me, he'd come asking me (and my daughter) to come back. I've asked him many times to leave but he won't. He believes we must stay together for our daughter because it's better for all of us. He thinks we're having problems because of where we are now and if we moved somewhere else, it would be better for us as a family. Part of me wants to stay because i feel maybe he's right and should try again in a better environment.\n\nSometimes I feel its entirely my fault, but deep down i also think i've been emotionally manipulated. I start to think my emotions are a burden, that I can't talk to him or my feelings are invalid. Or i'd be a bad mum if i ever left. Or that I can't live without him.I do understand maybe he wasn't ready after all and neither was i. We had some of the harshest lockdowns in the world so it might've impacted us, but all he sees is himself and says that i'm the problem. I want to leave and I also want to do whats best for us, like staying, but at the same time I can't handle the inconsistency anymore. I feel worn out and depressed everyday because of it. We still love each other, i might still have hope (i'm pretty positive in general but not sure now).\n\ntl;dr I want to leave the relationship with our child but I can't as I'd be a bad mum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: regarding the why didn't you abort or have you heard of birth control: we live in a country where birth control is hard to find, super, really expensive or made into fakes.

    "human": "There’s a reason why these men go for younger women. No inexperienced older one would take an asshole",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you're torn between leaving the relationship and staying for the sake of your child. I want to acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle, and it takes a lot of courage to share your story.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you didn't have a choice in the matter when it came to getting pregnant. You didn't have access to reliable birth control, and the option of abortion was not available to you. That's not your fault.\n\nRegarding your partner's behavior, it's unacceptable that he accused you of infidelity and didn't take responsibility for his actions. His lack of empathy, invalidation of your emotions, and inconsistent behavior are all red flags. It's understandable that you feel emotionally manipulated and worn out.\n\nIt's important to recognize that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel heard, validated, and respected. You deserve a partner who acknowledges your feelings and supports you through life's challenges.\n\nI want to challenge the thought that you'd be a bad mom if you left your partner. You are already a good mom, and your child's well-being is not solely dependent on your partner. In fact, being in a toxic relationship can negatively impact your child's development and emotional well-being.\n\nIt's essential to consider your own emotional and mental health in this situation. You're already struggling with depression and anxiety, and staying in this relationship may exacerbate these issues. It's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and consider what's best for you.\n\nI want to suggest a few things for you to consider:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Reach out to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your emotions and develop a plan for your situation.\n2. Create a safety plan: Make a plan for yourself and your child in case you decide to leave the relationship. This could include having a safe place to stay, a support network, and a plan for financial stability.\n3. Consider couples therapy: If you do decide to stay in the relationship, consider seeking couples therapy to work on communication and conflict resolution. However, it's essential to prioritize your own needs and well-being in this process.\n4. Focus on self-care: Make time for activities that bring you joy, practice self-compassion, and prioritize your physical and emotional well-being.\n\nRemember, you are not alone, and there are resources available to support you. You deserve to be in a healthy, loving relationship where you feel valued and respected."

    "sentence": "Hello internet friends,\n\nI am wondering the age old question of how do I respond when being asked when my boyfriend (33M) and I (26F) are getting married. We’ve been together for three years next month. I’m about 2/3 of the way through grad school. I really want to get married but I know it just isn’t a great time because I’m in school and boyfriend just got a job promotion and is still trying to steady himself in that. I’ve tried to answer this numerous ways before. And I’m asking because with the holidays coming all the religious relatives on both sides are going to be asking when we’re getting married. I will list what I’ve tried before, but always garners me a sad “poor you” look. \n\n- “one thing at a time, I have to finish grad school first” \n\n- “that’s a great question, you should probably ask [partners name]” \n\n- “not clear, let me know if you hear anything though” \n\n- literally walking away or entirely changing the subject. \n\nI don’t feel super confident in any of my responses though. Can I get some better responses?\n\nTL;DR: I need better responses to basically nicely (or sassily, idc at this point) tell people that I have no idea when the bae will propose and to stop fucking asking.",

The \"It's not the right time\" approach:\n\t* \"I appreciate your excitement, but I think it's a bit premature to talk about marriage right now. We're both focused on our individual goals and priorities, and we're not quite ready to make any big decisions.\"\n\t* \"I know it's a popular question, but we're not even thinking about it right now. We're just enjoying each other's company and focusing on our own personal growth.\"\n2.

But for now, let's just focus on the present and enjoy the time we have together.\"\n\t* \"I'd rather not speculate about the future just yet. Can we talk about something else?

Can we talk about something else?\"\n\t* \"I'm not sure why everyone's so fixated on marriage. Can we focus on other aspects of our relationship, like our shared interests or goals?\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to be honest and direct while still being kind and respectful. You don't owe anyone an explanation or a timeline for your relationship. Prioritize your own feelings and boundaries, and don't be afraid to set those boundaries with others."

    "sentence": "How to make friends. I've been at University for 2 months now and I wouldn't say i have any friends. I mean sure i know people, talk to people and sit with people in lectures but they just aren't friends like my pals from back home i.e we don't hang out, don't text and generally don't talk about anything other than the work.\n\nSo simply put, how can i make friends?",
    "human": "I have moved around quite a bit and had to make a lot of new friends. It's not a quick or easy process really, so don't feel bad that you're having a bit of trouble with it!\n\nThat being said, here are some things that I have found help out a lot:\n\n1) Like other people said, join a group that meets regularly for some activity (multiple times per week would be perfect, but once per week is ok). When you go, be sure that you're talking to people. Also, if people are doing something before/after the meeting, be sure to go (even if you're tired or busy).\n\n2) Create your own events. You've probably met a lot of people by now, even if you're not best pals with them yet. Organize a party or get-together with all of them. Outside of college, I really like having people over for dinner/brunch/dessert. Inviting people to your home is a great way to get closer to them. If you can't do that (since you probably live in a dorm), maybe have a movie night sometime. Create a facebook event or email a bunch of guys and gals you have met (maybe around 20). It's ok if only half of them show up. Follow up with a couple people you're kind of close to, and if you get only a small group of people to come over, that's ok. At the very least, inviting people to hang out is one of the best ways to get invited to hang out with them.\n\n3) In college I would try to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner with the same group. I would have breakfast and lunch with people I had a class with before/after the meal. I would have dinner with my roommates. You can start this by just suggesting it to someone you live near or have a similar schedule with, and inviting them regularly.\n\n4) In the end, I think platonic and romantic relationships are formed when you have shared interests/backgrounds, regular interaction, and mutual trust/respect. I've already talked about the first two, but the third (mutual trust/respect) can be a bit hard. These are formed by sharing difficult experiences (e.g., working on a tough project together) or sharing emotional experiences (e.g., having a particularly deep conversation about an emotional topic). After you've hung out with someone for a while, I think finding a time to talk about your deep values/passions is helpful. For friends, it could be talking about how you like that cute girl in your Biology class, but you're afraid to ask her out. Don't spill your heart out all at once, but sharing personal information (that makes you a bit vulnerable) shows that you trust that person, and subtly communicates that you want more than a superficial relationship with that person.\n\n5) Finally, try to be a fun person to be around. Be supportive of people, tell jokes/anecdotes, have ideas of what you can do for fun, and be happy.\n\nSorry this was long, but I hope it helps!",
    "base_reply": "Making friends in a new environment can be tough! It's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and taking the first step by recognizing you want to make friends.\n\nFirstly, let's break down what's not working for you: you're surrounded by people, but it's not translating to meaningful relationships. This is a common experience for many people, especially in a university setting.\n\nTo make friends, you need to focus on building connections with people who share similar interests, values, or goals. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Identify your interests: What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Write down a list of your hobbies, passions, or things you're good at. This will help you find like-minded people.\n2. Join a club or group: Look for clubs, societies, or groups related to your interests. This could be a sports team, a book club, a music group, or even a volunteering opportunity. This will give you a chance to meet people who share your passions.\n3. Attend events: Attend events, seminars, or workshops related to your interests. This could be a concert, a conference, or a meetup. These events can be great opportunities to meet new people.\n4. Be open and genuine: When you meet new people, be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. Share your thoughts, opinions, and experiences. People are more likely to connect with someone who is authentic.\n5. Follow up and follow through: If you hit it off with someone, make sure to follow up and stay in touch. Suggest getting together for coffee or a study session, and make an effort to keep the conversation going.\n6. Be patient: Making friends takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on building connections and relationships, rather than trying to rush the process.\n\nRemember, making friends is a two-way street. It's not just about finding people who like you, but also about finding people who you genuinely enjoy spending time with.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay if it takes time to build friendships. Focus on building connections, and with time, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you?"

    "sentence": "Throwaway, for obvious reasons. This is gonna be a long one, I already thank everyone who bother to read the whole thing. I’d also like to apologize my possible grammar mistakes – English is not my first language. I understand that the general rule is that “you need to talk about it” – believe me, we have.\n\nI (27f) and my boyfriend (30m) have been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years. I have a child (7f) from previous relationship. Me and my boyfriend have been living in different countries and despite of that we have been lucky and met each other pretty often (once or twice in a month). On August I got accepted to carry out my exchange studies in his city, so I temporarily moved in. We took this opportunity to see if we are compactible before doing any rash decisions (like moving in together for good). Now I’ve noticed some things and I need some perspective that am I just overreacting or are my thoughts reasonable.\n\nMy boyfriend has a stable income and decent job but has no drive to push himself further in life. His only goal in life is to be happy. He likes to play video- and card games. He works from home and most of his interest are in home (if not counting those once in a month-occasions where he goes out with his friends and drinks), in front of TV or other screens. He does not exercise, he seems not to have developed any stronger opinions about anything, he does not feel the need to read or educate himself, he lacks initiative completely and waits things just to happen or other people doing them for him.\n\nI guess that I am very opposite of that – I am finishing my bachelors (engineering), taking care of my daughter, working, going to gym 4-5 times in a week, planning common activities, scheduling upcoming trips, you name it. I am setting new goals after achieving the previous ones and feel like that developing myself mentally and physically is required if I want to have fulfilled life. I am aiming for Master's degree after the current studies. Discussion is my main way to develop a relationship to other person, but my partner does not feel the need talking with me about things anymore because “we have been already talked about everything possible” and “talking about things was different when we were in honeymoon phase”. If we have something troubling which hasn’t been settled yet, I always have to be the one opening up a conversation about it. He explains this with “waiting for the right moment” instead of just going towards the problem, solving it and moving on, which usually takes so long that the situation gets very infected and hurtful, and I end up taking the lead and speaking up while crying out of frustration. I’ve told him that “if you’re gonna wait for the right moment, you’ll end up waiting forever”, but reasoning doesn’t have any effect. He has agreed that he lacks the strength to face difficult subjects, which causes that I cannot trust and rely on him on difficult situations, and I have to survive alone. He hugs me and says “there, there”, but it’s not unfortunately enough – and I carry unexplainable guilt about it.\n\nThis all has caused me to go emotionally further. My sex drive has shrunk into the minimum, and I usually am a person who feels “restless” multiple times in a week, basically every other day. He has been complaining that we don’t spend enough time together anymore, but it is very difficult to sit in front of TV evening after another when I actually would need something more stimulating. I’ve tried to suggest different things to spend time together – camping, travelling, going to gigs, geocatching, starting a common hobby like tennis, cooking, baking, listening to music albums and rating them, playing instruments together, anything – but nothing picks his interest. During 1,5 months I’ve started to feel myself as a maid, mother, schedule maker, mental coach, psychologist, project leader, cook and travel service. Thoughts about breaking up have been popping up more and more frequently, almost daily now. I do not feel heard, I do not feel loved, I do not feel worth of effort. I feel like that my interests are below my boyfriends interests, that my thoughts are not important, that all of the issues we have are just inside of my brain and I should just stop overreacting. Why do I not deserve the same volume of effort what I am putting? Why the things what I am suggesting in order to get closer again are not worth of trying? I’ve always heard about that communication is the key to success, but it contains mostly empty words – a lot of promises about change which never comes. He has agreed to go to couple therapy with me, but he is not doing anything to book a time (obviously I have to do it, if nothing else, it just feels unfair if I have to do that TOO, since I feel like I've already done so much). He is promising to start talking about things more, and well, that hasn't happened.\n\nI love him dearly and he is a very kind person. I play games and watch TV series sometimes too, don’t get me wrong. There are good things as well in our relationship, like common sense of humour. I just am tired of all of this. Everything feels unnecessary difficult. I have heard the phrase “Young people nowadays are giving up too easily for love instead of just working it out” maybe little bit too many times, because that has really sunk in, and I feel like that I have no right to leave before I’ve tried everything what I possibly can. Am I just too impatient when I am waiting for him to do his part? When I’ve been working enough for our relationship that it’s okay and reasonable to give up? I feel so guilty and entitled to whine about this, because he is a good guy – he is not violent, brings his part on the table financially and tells me every day that he loves me, and something tells me it should be enough – otherwise I am just woman who has too high expectations. Are my expectations unrealistic? Is there something else I could do to save us?\n\nTl;dr: Relationship changed after moving together – We have gotten very far away from each other emotionally. My boyfriend does not want to do anything with me, I have tried to suggest different things what could bring us more together. Talking is not effective. Our ways to live are very different. I am considering breaking up. Wondering can this situation be caused because we are so different people or that I haven’t tried enough for making this work? How long I should try to keep going before giving up?",

It's great that you're aware of your own needs and goals, and it's not selfish to want to work on your relationship.\n\nRegarding your concerns about your boyfriend's lack of drive, initiative, and motivation, it's essential to recognize that these traits can be deal-breakers for many people. If he's content with his current lifestyle and doesn't see a need to grow or change, it may be challenging for you to feel fulfilled in the relationship.\n\nIt's also understandable that you feel like you're doing all the heavy lifting in the relationship, and it's exhausting. It's not fair to expect you to carry the emotional burden alone, and it's crucial to communicate your needs and boundaries clearly.\n\nRegarding the lack of progress in your conversations, it's not uncommon for people to feel stuck in a rut, especially when they're not willing to work on themselves. If your boyfriend is not willing to make an effort to improve communication and address issues, it may be a sign that he's not invested in the relationship.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you can't force someone to change or grow. You can only control how you respond to the situation and what you're willing to accept.\n\nAs for your feelings of guilt and entitlement, it's essential to remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship. It's not about being entitled; it's about recognizing your own worth and what you bring to the table.\n\nIn terms of what you can do to save the relationship, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. It's essential to express your needs and boundaries clearly and assertively. You may also want to consider couples therapy, but only if you both are willing to put in the effort to work on the issues.\n\nLastly, remember that you can't pour from an empty cup. You need to prioritize your own self-care and well-being. If you're feeling drained and unhappy, it may be time to re-evaluate whether this relationship is sustainable for you.\n\nIn terms of your question about how long you should try to keep going before giving up, it's a personal decision that only you can make. However, I would suggest taking a step back and re-evaluating what you want from this relationship. Are there specific issues that you're willing to work on, or are there fundamental differences that you can't overcome?\n\nRemember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship.

I guess you can say it wasn't technically cheating, but we were \"working on it.\" She said she did not think I was happy either since I was consistently accusing her and manipulating her. Well, that same guy she cheated on me with ended up sexually assaulting her the next day. He was convicted when he later on when he did it to another woman. I reacted poorly by saying she deserved it and that he did not know.. She was angered rightfully so, because she was completely knocked out due to him drugging her. I did not feel any remorse for her, and I still don't feel it. In all honesty, I asked her things such as \"Did you like it? Was he better?\" Clearly, my insecurities showed then too. But, she finally apologized for her wrongdoings in a letter. She stated;\n\n\"You had done nothing wrong in terms of the failure of our relationship. I don't want you to leave thinking that anything you would have done would of prevented the decisions I made during these couple of months. I lied to you and manipulated you. I wanted to secure your happiness and make you the center of what my life would of became, but that came crashing down when I gave myself off to another man. I proved to you that you were not a priority, and I am deeply sorry for what I have done.\"\n\nI am not going to give her a second chance and I have completely cut off all contact. I don't know if I have contributed to her the actions she has made. She wrote in that letter that I had done nothing wrong. She said that \"My friends stated you were abusive, childish, and manipulative when you accused me of cheating. I have proven now that your accusations hold truth to them.\"\n\nI am not sure what to do. I feel numb. I don't think I contributed to any of this. I know we were broken up, but the way she lied to me and then went off and gave herself to someone else brought me into the biggest hole that I have ever been in. But, a part of me wonders if I was at any fault? I was never dishonest with her or cheated myself. So now I feel as if the girl that I once loved never existed to begin with.\n\nTL;DR; Accused girlfriend of cheating after years. She finally did it. Did I deserve what she did? Was I a contributer for the downfall of our relationship? I need someone to open my eyes, because I don't think I did anything. I am angry at her despite her taking responsibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Did people miss the part where I stated that she lied to me and manipulated me when saying she wanted to make things work? She was on dating apps and had sex with someone else and was lying to me about it??",
    "human": "&gt;Well, that same guy she cheated on me with ended up sexually assaulting her the next day. He was convicted when he later on when he did it to another woman. I reacted poorly by saying she deserved it\n\nYou're a *disgusting* person. She still shouldn't have cheated, but dear God what bad luck for her that she ever decided to date you.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about the pain and complexity of your situation. It's understandable that you're struggling to make sense of it all.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that you did have legitimate concerns about your girlfriend's trustworthiness, which led you to accuse her of cheating. While your methods were manipulative, it's clear that your insecurities were rooted in a deep-seated fear of being replaced.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that your girlfriend's actions were unacceptable. She lied to you repeatedly, manipulated you, and ultimately cheated on you. Her letter acknowledging her mistakes and taking responsibility is a crucial step towards healing, but it's crucial to acknowledge that her actions were not excusable.\n\nRegarding your role in the relationship's downfall, it's natural to wonder if you contributed to it. While you were honest about your insecurities, your methods were problematic, and it's likely that your accusations and manipulations created a toxic dynamic. It's possible that your girlfriend felt trapped and resentful, leading her to seek comfort elsewhere.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that her choices were hers alone, and she ultimately chose to lie and cheat. You can't control someone else's actions, but you can control how you react to them.\n\nAs for your anger towards your ex, it's understandable given the circumstances. You were hurt, betrayed, and manipulated. However, it's crucial to work on letting go of that anger and focusing on your own healing. Holding onto resentment will only prolong your pain and make it harder to move forward.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that you didn't deserve what your ex did. You were entitled to honesty and respect in the relationship, and her actions were a violation of that. It's okay to acknowledge your own flaws and work on personal growth, but you don't deserve to be treated the way you were.\n\nRemember that you're not responsible for your ex's actions, and you deserve to move forward with self-respect and dignity. It may take time, but with self-reflection, support, and patience, you can heal and find a more fulfilling relationship in the future."

    "sentence": "So my gf (F 23) and I (M 22) have dated for 8 months now. It’s my first relationship and we love each other so much. However, my gf’s last relationship a couple years ago was extremely abusive and toxic. She hasn’t gotten therapy for it yet, and because of it, she has toxic tendencies that are completely unintentional. She also has depression and anxiety causing her to have intense reactions when emotional. \n\nShe has the tendency to take her emotions out on me when she’s upset about something external and be rude to me. She gaslights me during arguments and raises her voice at me and is aggressive while I’m trying to be civil. And she always becomes rational and apologizes after the fact.\n\nI recently called her out on it when the gaslighting was quite clear. And she listened and acknowledged it and has been emotional the past 2 days about it. She feels terrible about herself. She said she would take therapy and I don’t deserve to be treated like this. I thought it was all well, but we called today, and she was really emotional saying she was insecure I’d leave her. And that she doesn’t think I love her anymore after calling her out on her gaslighting and emotional abuse. I reassured her for like 45 minutes saying I still loved her and wanted to work with her and that I forgave her, but it didn’t help. She is upset at herself, all over the place, and just doesn’t seem ready to have a solution-oriented discussion. She did tell me throughout that my reassurance wasn’t helping her and I could leave. But it was my fault for staying on the call and continuing to try to make her feel better.\n\nI’m just so fatigued and had to do all this after a whole day of work. I really love her and want to stay because she could change. She has been so good to me otherwise and we have so much fun together. I don’t know what to do. I feel so helpless. Any advice?\n\nTLDR: Called gf out on gaslighting and emotional abuse, and she acknowledged it and said she was really sorry. But now she’s been having an emotional breakdown and thinks I don’t love her anymore. I’m exhausted. What do I do?",
    "human": "Her making you reassure her that you still love her and won't leave her after she abused you is also abuse and unacceptable. Stop doing that, because it just reinforces her abusive behavior. Instead you can say, \"It's normal to feel terrible when you do a terrible thing, but the thing to do is to stop doing terrible things.\" or \"Well, hopefully therapy will make things work out.\" or even, \"I do not currently intend to leave you, but if you keep abusing me, then that will probably change.\" Harsh, but fair. And it doesn't cause you to keep encouraging the abuse. \n\nIf she can't stop abusing you, then she does need to be single. It doesn't matter why she is abusing you. It's not okay to use a person as your training device to heal from trauma. She needs to become somebody who doesn't abuse others. And if she is truly a good person, she will demonstrate that by making getting therapy a priority she acts on and puts real work into.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling fatigued and helpless. First, let me acknowledge that you've taken a huge step by recognizing the toxic patterns in your girlfriend's behavior and having the courage to call her out on it. That's not an easy thing to do.\n\nNow, regarding your situation, I want to emphasize that it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself. It's okay to acknowledge that you're exhausted and need some space. You've done your part by having an open and honest conversation, and it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" your girlfriend's issues or make her feel better.\n\nBefore we dive into what you should do next, I want to caution you that it's essential to recognize that your girlfriend's emotional breakdown might not be solely about your reassurance. It's possible that she's struggling to process her own emotions, guilt, and shame related to her past experiences and the recent confrontation. It's not uncommon for people who have been in abusive relationships to struggle with emotional regulation and self-awareness.\n\nHere's what I would suggest:\n\n1. Take some time for yourself: You've had a long day, and you need to recharge. Take a break, do something that relaxes you, and prioritize your own self-care.\n2. Set boundaries: If your girlfriend is not willing to have a solution-oriented discussion and is instead focusing on her own emotions, it may be necessary to set some boundaries. You've already done your part by having the initial conversation; now it's her turn to take responsibility for her actions and work on her own growth.\n3. Re-evaluate your priorities: While you mentioned that your girlfriend has been good to you otherwise and you have fun together, it's essential to consider whether the benefits of the relationship outweigh the costs. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, heard, and valued.\n4. Consider a temporary separation: If your girlfriend is not willing to work on her issues and is instead focusing on her own emotions, it might be necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate the relationship. A temporary separation can give you both space to reflect on your feelings and priorities.\n5. Seek support for yourself: Remember that you're not alone in this. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friends and family about your feelings and concerns. It's essential to have a support system to help you navigate this challenging situation.\n\nRemember, you can't change your girlfriend's behavior or fix her issues, but you can prioritize your own well-being and make decisions that are best for you."

    "sentence": "This is long, and it may not even all make sense. I'm pretty upset right now and just getting it out. \n\n My now fiance (29M) and I (29F) recently got engaged. My fiance used to be a serial cheater. He cheated on every major relationship he had. He also pursued countless women in relationships, some were even married. However, when he met me he had been single for 3 years and he was proud of that fact. He said he had wanted to take time to get to know himself and know what he wanted and become a better person. I thought this was a great sign. Everyone deserves a second chance and a chance at growth. \n\nWell that leads us to today. This morning my fiance got a text from someone that he knows, albeit not very well. She accused him of telling her best friend (anna) that he loves her and then turning around and getting engaged. Except we've been dating for a year and a half. He also said the fb messages with Anna have been deleted. \n\nRewind some, a few months back I found out that he still had probably 90% of his old hookups on his fb. And with his history, I got really insecure about it and asked him to delete them all. He said he didn't talk to them anymore and he didn't consider them friends so he didn't care to delete them. I said those were the perfect arguments to get rid of them and I asked him to do it. (I know that if he wanted to cheat, he would with whoever, but I felt like it was a little disrespectful that he was with me and still had these women who knew he cheated with them in the past on his fb). He said he deleted them all and I was grateful and moved on.\n\nBack to today, he is still friends with Anna on fb and he had been talking to her just before we got together. I told him that makes me really insecure, especially if he was telling her he loved her right before he met me. He got defensive and said I thought we were done with this. I thought you weren't going to ask me to delete people off of fb anymore. To be fair, I had said that when I thought they were all gone. As it turns out, according to him, he was talking to Anna just 2 months before we met. I told him I'm not asking him to delete anyone, but I'm feeling insecure all over again. \n\nAdditionally our entire relationship has been built on the fact that he was single for 3 years becoming a better person just to find out that he had been pursing Anna while she was in a relationship just a few months before we met. He only stopped because she turned him down. \n\nNow I have to wonder if he really changed at all? Are the messages with Anna really deleted or did he just not want me to look? Or are they really deleted because he was talking to her more recently than he said and he wanted to be rid of the evidence? Was he just waiting for someone single to come along who wanted him and I was the first one? I'm so confused and hurt and I just wish I could go back to yesterday when I believed he was the man he said he is.\n\nTl;dr My fiance was a serial cheater, but said he's changed. Now I may have evidence that that is not the case and I believe I've made a mistake.",
    "human": "Queen, with all due respect, why? \n\nIs he a project? Are you a social worker?\n\nThis entire relationship was founded on the belief that he'd changed and that's why he remained single. But that was a lie. Your relationship is based on a lie.\n\nI don't know why women think they can change men. Is he a diaper? Why are you lying to yourself?\n\nYou're young. You'll find someone who isn't a piece of shit. This man thinks you're not going to leave which is why he has the audacity. Leave and prove him wrong. Let him stay alone and miserable. Don't let him drag you with him.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt, confused, and insecure. It sounds like you're trying to make sense of the situation and wondering if your fiancé has truly changed.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your fiancé's past actions are concerning, and it's natural to feel uneasy about it. His behavior is not something to be taken lightly, and it's crucial to consider whether he's genuinely changed or if this is just a pattern of behavior.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you did try to address your concerns about his past relationships and social media connections, and he didn't seem to take your concerns seriously. His defensiveness when you brought it up again suggests that he may not be as committed to change as he claimed.\n\nThe fact that he's still friends with Anna on Facebook and had been talking to her just before you met is a red flag. It's possible that he's not deleted the messages, or he's hiding something. His explanation that he stopped pursuing her because she turned him down doesn't necessarily mean he's changed; it could be a convenient excuse.\n\nYou're right to wonder if he's truly changed or if he's just waiting for someone new to come along. His actions seem to suggest that he may not have undergone significant personal growth, and it's possible that he's just repeating patterns.\n\nI want to emphasize that you deserve someone who is honest, transparent, and committed to change. It's essential to take your time to think about whether you can trust your fiancé and whether you're willing to work through these issues together.\n\nRemember that you can't change someone else; you can only change how you respond to the situation. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek support from loved ones, a therapist, or a trusted friend. You deserve to be happy and in a healthy, fulfilling relationship."

That and she was literally one of the hottest people ever when she was younger (still is I guess) \n\nIt perks me up. Every day, she messages me to wish me a great day and we can talk for hours and hours about stuff. It's awesome. I live in a foreign country and I met her though my ex just a few years ago. \n\nToday we got talking about dating sites. And she said 'I hope I'm not single. I would choose the wrong guy on a dating site. Probably one that has slept with everybody. Disgusting' \n\nSo I said 'there's people like me who have hardly slept with anybody there too. There are good people' \n\n(we have both slept with roughly the same number of people due to long term relationships). \n\nShe said 'I'm not looking to date you though.

Hell even my exes still wanna talk) \n\nI'm just confused. It shouldn't have upset me but it did. \n\nTl;dr: best friend said I was not date able.

If this woman was really just your platonic friend, then hearing that she doesn't want to date you shouldn't bother you at all. In fact, that's precisely what it means to be in a platonic friendship with someone: it means that you don't want to date each other.",
    "base_reply": "I understand why you're feeling confused and a bit hurt. It's natural to feel that way when someone you care about, even if it's just as a friend, makes a comment that makes you question your worth.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your friend's comment was not meant to be a personal attack on you. She was simply expressing her preferences and standards for a partner, which may not align with yours. It's not uncommon for people to have different preferences and standards, and it doesn't define your worth as a person.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your friend's comment was likely not about you as a person, but about her own preferences and what she's looking for in a partner. She didn't say you're not good enough or that you're not worthy of love; she simply stated that you're not what she's looking for.\n\nIt's great that you're aware that you're not attracted to your friend, and that's perfectly okay. It's essential to prioritize your own feelings and desires, and it's wonderful that you're secure enough to know that you're not interested in her romantically.\n\nAs for your confidence, it's normal to feel a bit shaken after a comment like that.

An older woman who was eavesdropping decided to butt in and laugh and tell me I was too young to get married, I tried to laugh it off by saying “Thanks for letting me know my eye cream works!” but she ruined our conversation and put a dampener on my excitement.\n\nI don’t go around broadcasting our engagement as I know people don’t really care and I don’t want to push my personal life in peoples faces.

I'm not sure that's entirely possible or desirable, especially when it comes to people who matter in your life. However, you can work on developing a healthy detachment. Here's what might help:\n\n1. Set clear boundaries: Establish what you're comfortable discussing and what you're not. Be firm but polite when communicating your boundaries to others.\n2. Practice emotional detachment: When engaging with toxic individuals, try to separate their words and actions from your own emotions. Recognize that their behavior is a reflection of them, not you. Repeat a mantra like \"I am not responsible for their emotions\" to help you detach.\n3. Focus on your own emotions: Instead of getting caught up in the drama, focus on how you feel. Acknowledge your emotions, and remind yourself that you have the right to feel whatever you're feeling.\n4. Develop a growth mindset: Believe that people can change, but also acknowledge that it's not your responsibility to change them. Focus on your own personal growth and well-being instead.\n5.

Limit exposure: If someone is consistently draining your energy or causing you distress, it might be necessary to limit your interactions with them or take a break from the relationship.\n7. Seek support: Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you. Having a strong support network can help you feel less isolated and more resilient in the face of toxicity.\n\nRemember, you don't have to \"not care at all\" to protect yourself. It's okay to care about people while also setting boundaries and prioritizing your own well-being. With time and practice, you can develop a healthier approach to dealing with toxic situations.\n\nKeep in mind that you're not alone in this struggle.

Now for the unethicalness...\n\nMy parents have offered to pay for a majority of my rent and put a lease in their name so that i could live there off the lease. I found a place with over 330 different apartments so chances of them even seeing me are slim. The leasing office is at the other end of the complex, most likely wont need to have any contact with them other than a work order and i could easily leave my apartment while that was happening and put that in online. \n\nSO. How big of a deal is this? How likely is it that i will be caught? Two apartment locators have suggested i do this. I live a very quiet life now and i just want to live somewhere safe. Is this a stupid idea?",
    "human": "I don’t see why it would be an issue as long as you don’t cause problems or draw attention to yourself",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad to hear you've turned your life around and are working hard in school. However, I have to advise you that your plan to have your parents lease an apartment for you, while understandable, may not be the best idea.\n\nWhile it's great that you've had a 4-year streak of sobriety and are doing well in school, the fact remains that you have five misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession. This can still raise red flags for landlords and leasing agents, even if you're not using the complex.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Liability concerns: By having your parents lease an apartment for you, they're taking on liability for your actions. If something were to happen, such as a noise complaint or a property damage issue, the landlord might hold your parents responsible.\n2. Disclosure requirements: Most landlords and leasing agents are required to disclose any information that could affect the tenancy. If your parents sign a lease without disclosing your criminal record, they could be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws.\n3. Potential for discovery: Even if you don't have direct contact with the leasing office, there's still a chance that someone could discover your presence in the apartment. For example, a maintenance worker or delivery person might see you, or a neighbor could report suspicious activity.\n4. Long-term consequences: This arrangement could have long-term consequences for your relationship with your parents and your ability to secure future housing. It's essential to be honest and upfront about your past and work on rebuilding your reputation.\n\nInstead of having your parents lease an apartment for you, I recommend exploring other options:\n\n1. Look into apartments that offer second chances: Some landlords and property managers are willing to work with individuals with criminal records. You can search online for \"apartments for people with criminal records\" or \"second-chance apartments.\"\n2. Consider a co-signer: If you find an apartment you like, you could ask a trusted friend or family member who has a good credit score to co-sign the lease with you. This can help alleviate some of the landlord's concerns.\n3. Work on rebuilding your credit: Focus on improving your credit score by paying bills on time, keeping credit utilization low, and avoiding new criminal activity. This will make it easier to secure a lease in the future.\n4. Be honest and open: When applying for apartments, be honest and open about your past. Explain your situation and provide any necessary documentation. This will help you build trust with potential landlords and increase your chances of securing a lease.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize honesty and transparency in your housing search. While it might be tempting to try to circumvent the system, it's better to focus on rebuilding your reputation and securing a lease the right way."

As a child, I always got many toys and everything I wanted, and that caused me to this day, get very excited and pumped for something, and then when I get it, I get bored of it. One time I got a nintendo DS but got very insane buyer's remorse that hurt really bad. \n\nEven as a grown up(22 yrs) I get very wary when I'm going to buy something, and I have a hard time knowing if I will use it or not, no matter how much research I do. For example, I want to buy the new macbook pro because it will help lots for college and jobs(Im a computer science student) but I'm afraid of getting it, then discovering I actually use it very little, making me feel very shitty.",
    "human": "If you want to buy something, don't.  Wait at least a week, but up to a month for major purchases.  (MacBooks would be major.)  While you are waiting, research the hell out of it.  Find several alternatives and research them as well.  Find everything wrong with what you want and try your absolute hardest to find something better.  Strongly consider build quality and how long it will last.  (Can you hand it down to your kids when you outgrow it?)  If at the end of the waiting period you still want the item, you probably won't have buyer's remorse when you get it.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It sounds like you're aware of your tendency to get excited and then disappointed, and that's a huge step in being mindful of your spending habits. Here are some tips that might help you avoid buyer's remorse:\n\n1. **Set a 30-day waiting period**: When you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before making the purchase. This can help you assess if the desire was just an impulsive want or a genuine need. You might find that the excitement wears off, and you're no longer interested in the item.\n2. **Ask yourself the hard questions**: Before buying something, ask yourself:\n\t* What specific problem does this solve for me?\n\t* Will it make a significant impact on my life or goals?\n\t* Can I achieve the same benefits with a more affordable or alternative option?\n\t* Am I buying this to impress others or because I genuinely need it?\n3. **Prioritize experiences over material possessions**: As a computer science student, you're probably aware of the importance of skills and experiences in your field. Consider investing in courses, certifications, or networking events that can benefit your career more than a new gadget.\n4. **Set a budget and track your spending**: Keep track of your expenses and stick to your budget. This will help you make more intentional purchasing decisions and avoid overspending. You can use apps like Mint, You Need a Budget (YNAB), or even just a spreadsheet to stay on top of your finances.\n5. **Consider the opportunity cost**: When you're thinking about buying something, think about what else you could do with that money. Could you use it to pay off debt, invest in your education, or save for a bigger goal? This can help you make a more informed decision.\n6. **Remind yourself that it's okay to say no**: It's okay to pass on something, even if it seems like a great deal. Remember that your time and money are valuable, and you shouldn't feel pressured to buy something just because it's popular or trendy.\n\nRegarding the MacBook Pro, ask yourself if it's truly necessary for your studies and career goals. If you can demonstrate that it will significantly benefit your education or professional development, it might be worth the investment. However, if you're buying it solely because you want the latest and greatest, it might be worth considering alternative options or waiting until you're more established in your career.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and think carefully before making a purchase. By being more mindful of your spending habits and considering the bigger picture, you can make more intentional decisions that align with your goals and values."

    "base_reply": "While it's true that some doctors might be more willing to work with patients who don't have insurance, it's essential to approach this situation with a clear understanding of the potential consequences.\n\nThat being said, there are a few options you could explore:\n\n1. Community Health Centers (CHCs): These centers provide primary care services, including prescription medication, to underserved communities. They often have sliding-scale fees based on income and may offer reduced or no-cost services. You can find a CHC near you through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) website.\n2. Free Clinics: Some cities have free clinics that offer limited medical services, including prescription medication. These clinics usually rely on donations and may have limited availability. You can search online for \"free clinics near me\" or check websites like FreeClinics.com.\n3. Discount Clinics: Some retail clinics, like those found in pharmacies or retail stores, might offer discounted prices for prescription medication. However, be aware that these clinics often have limited services and may not accept all insurance plans.\n4. Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs): Pharmaceutical companies often offer PAPs for certain medications. These programs provide discounted or free medication to eligible patients who can't afford their prescriptions. You can search for PAPs on the manufacturer's website or through the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (PPA) website.\n5. Non-Profit Organizations: Some non-profit organizations, like the Patient Access Network Foundation (PAN) or the HealthWell Foundation, offer assistance with prescription medication costs. You can check their websites to see if you're eligible for their programs.\n\nKeep in mind that these options might have limitations, and it's crucial to prioritize your health and well-being by seeking regular medical care. If you're uninsured, it's essential to explore your options for affordable health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace or your state's Medicaid program.\n\nRemember, while some doctors might be willing to work with you on a case-by-case basis, it's crucial to be transparent about your financial situation and to prioritize your health and well-being above all."

I really didn't have a motive to do so, but I noticed that his chat with his two best friends was especially active lately and I became curious. (FYI, we have each other's phone passwords but are only on the other's when in the car changing the music or something). When I took a look, I saw that his friends had been shit-talking me. Calling my existence \"cringe\" after one of them shared an invitation I had extended to them for a party that I attached a bitmoji to (for jokes, anyway). A few messages up, one of them was shit-talking my band that I am incredibly proud of. All this to say that my boyfriend hadn't reacted to a single comment of theirs. I was 1) hurt that his friends who I have been nothing but kind to were acting like high schoolers, talking down about someone several years younger and degrading me without reason and 2) hurt that my boyfriend did nothing to defend me in the chat. I wound up confronting my boyfriend about it, saying that I had looked at his phone and apologized for doing so, but that the comments I stumbled across hurt me very much. I took accountability for looking at his phone without his knowledge and he forgave me, but he insists his friends like to get a rise out of him and that he just ignores it when they do. I don't think that it is chill under any circumstance to \"roast\" me the way that they do, outright insulting my existence and my passions. I'm not sure what approach to take with my boyfriend if he feels that not defending me was an appropriate reaction to take with his best friends. Thoughts?\n\nTL:DR: Boyfriend's friends insulting me in a groupchat with him, boyfriend insisting it's them trying to get a rise out of him. I don't see anything okay with it, especially since he didn't bother to defend me.",
    "human": "Yeah I wouldn’t put up with this. T’wer it me, I’d be letting him know that his behavior shows me that he’s comfortable with his friends shit talking me and that I’m NOT okay with that.

At least not bothered enough to do something. \n\nDo with that what you will, but when I put myself in your shoes I’m shocked that someone who claims to love you is actually fucking comfortable with hearing anyone talk about you that way, let alone his friends. Fuck.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you came to me with this situation. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and unsure of what to do.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your boyfriend's friends' behavior is completely unacceptable. It's never okay to make fun of someone's existence, especially when they're not even present to defend themselves. It's even more hurtful that they're doing it behind your boyfriend's back, and that he didn't take a stand for you.\n\nAs for your boyfriend's reaction, it's concerning that he's downplaying the situation and saying that his friends are just trying to get a rise out of him. While it's possible that his friends might be trying to provoke him, it doesn't excuse his failure to defend you. As someone in a relationship, it's essential to have each other's backs, and his lack of response sends a message that your feelings and well-being aren't important to him.\n\nHere's a suggestion: have a follow-up conversation with your boyfriend, but this time, focus on how his inaction affected you, rather than the initial incident. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I understand that your friends might be trying to get a rise out of you, but when I saw those messages, it really hurt me. As your partner, I expect you to have my back and defend me when someone is talking negatively about me. Not doing so made me feel like my feelings aren't important to you. Can we work on finding a way to address this together? Maybe we can set boundaries with your friends or have a conversation with them about respecting me and our relationship?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're not trying to attack your boyfriend, but rather, you're looking for a way to improve your relationship and create a safer, more supportive environment. Remember to listen to his perspective and work together to find a solution that makes you both feel comfortable and respected.\n\nLastly, it's essential to consider whether this is a pattern in your relationship. Is your boyfriend consistently prioritizing his friendships over your feelings? Are there other instances where he's ignored your concerns or made you feel belittled? If so, it might be worth re-evaluating the relationship and considering whether it's healthy for you in the long run."

In January we were still talking and I caught her in a lie (although I didn't confront) about where she was one evening. We didn't live together as we were in LDR. Obviously she was on a date and the next communication was she didn't see any hope for us.  I was really devastated by the break up and trying to reconcile what happened.  She turned from my best friend, a sweet caring GF to cold emotionless person.  Even into March we were untangling some financial matters and she got mad when I brought up the relationship and said \"we are just a business transaction\".  A few weeks later, her texts to me were a bit more cordial and she texted \"hope all is ok\".\n\nI loved her 2 girls and my kids loved my ex. I have had no contact with her since January aside from the financial matters and none since April 1. I am trying to move on but I still have feelings for my ex. Well I got a graduation announcement for her daughter. I hold nothing against the daughter but in reality I am not part of her life anymore. Also, part of me thinks that if I send her daughter a grad card and money, my ex may think that I am still the caring sweet guy she loved and may open something up with us again. But that is unlikely I guess.\n\nDo I take the high road and send a card and money or just ignore because I am not in the daughter's life and to passively show that my ex's decision to end our relationship has consequences?

    "human": "Send the card/$$$ to the kid because you care about her, and it’s for the kid. This has zero to do with anything to do with your ex. Zero.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about the pain you're still carrying from your breakup. It's understandable that you're torn between your feelings and the desire to maintain a connection with your ex's daughter.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's natural to still have feelings for your ex, and it's okay to acknowledge those emotions. However, it's also important to prioritize your own healing and well-being.\n\nRegarding the graduation announcement, I would advise against sending a card or gift, at least for now. Here's why:\n\n1. It's not about you: While it's lovely to show appreciation for your ex's daughter, it's essential to recognize that this is her milestone, not yours. Your emotional attachment to her is rooted in your past relationship with her mother, not with her as an individual.\n2. Avoid mixed signals: By sending a card or gift, you might inadvertently send mixed signals to your ex. It could be misinterpreted as an attempt to rekindle a connection or to prove that you're still invested in their lives. This might lead to confusion, mixed emotions, or even more hurt.\n3. Focus on your own healing: Instead of focusing on your ex's daughter, channel your energy into nurturing your own emotional well-being. Use this opportunity to reflect on the lessons you've learned from the relationship, practice self-care, and work on building a stronger sense of self.\n4. Respect boundaries: You mentioned that you're not part of your ex's life anymore, and it's essential to respect those boundaries. Ignoring the graduation announcement might be a necessary step in acknowledging that you're no longer a part of their lives.\n\nIt's not about being passive-aggressive or sending a message that your ex's decision to end the relationship has consequences. It's about prioritizing your own healing, growth, and emotional well-being. You've already done your part by being a caring partner and co-parent during your relationship.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time to process your emotions and grieve the loss of the relationship. You're not obligated to maintain a connection with your ex or their daughter if it's no longer a healthy or positive dynamic for you.\n\nTake care of yourself, and focus on building a brighter future."

I've been trying to help her find work but she's not making an effort.\n\nWhen it was me and my son, I'd put food in the fridge (cooked meats, salads, bread, sandwich wraps etc) and he'd take care of himself but his girlfriend always asks for cooked meals for lunch and dinner and to make it worse, she won't eat left overs or the same thing twice in one day.

    "base_reply": "I understand your concerns and empathy towards your son's girlfriend. It's great that you're willing to help her and want to improve your relationship with her. Here's a suggested approach to address these issues without hurting her feelings:\n\n1. Open and honest conversation: Have a calm and respectful conversation with her about your concerns. Choose a private setting where you both feel comfortable. Start by expressing your appreciation for her presence in your home and your son's life, and acknowledge that you want to work together to find solutions.\n2. Focus on the impact: Instead of criticizing her behavior, focus on how it affects you and your son. For example, you could say, \"I've noticed that when you ask for cooked meals, it puts a lot of pressure on me to cook multiple times a day. I'd love to find a way to make it more manageable for everyone.\" or \"I've noticed that you don't eat leftovers, which means we're wasting food and money. I'd like to find a way to reduce waste.\"\n3. Use \"I\" statements: When expressing your concerns, use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. This helps to own your feelings and thoughts, making it harder for her to become defensive. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed when I have to cook multiple meals a day\" instead of \"You're always asking for cooked meals, it's so annoying.\"\n4. Offer alternatives: Provide alternatives and solutions instead of simply stating what's not working. For instance, you could suggest, \"Would you be open to helping with meal planning and prep? That way, we can find a system that works for everyone.\" or \"Would you be willing to eat leftovers or have a 'leftover day' once a week?\"\n5. Set boundaries: It's essential to set boundaries and communicate them clearly. Let her know what you're comfortable with and what you're not. For example, you could say, \"I understand you like to talk a lot, but I need some quiet time in the mornings. Would you be willing to give me 30 minutes to myself before we start the day?\"\n6. Listen actively: Make sure to listen to her perspective and concerns. Acknowledge her feelings and show empathy. This will help her feel heard and understood, making it more likely she'll be open to finding solutions.\n7. Be patient and consistent: Changing habits takes time, so be patient and consistent in your approach. Avoid being too critical or punitive, as this can create resistance and make the situation worse.\n\nExample script to get you started:\n\n\"Hey [her name], can we talk about some things that have been on my mind? I want to make sure we're all comfortable living together and that we can find a way to make it work. I've noticed that when you ask for cooked meals, it puts a lot of pressure on me to cook multiple times a day. I'd love to find a way to make it more manageable for everyone. Would you be open to helping with meal planning and prep? That way, we can find a system that works for everyone. And in the mornings, I need some quiet time to myself. Would you be willing to give me 30 minutes to myself before we start the day? I want us to be able to find a way to make this work and have a positive living situation.\"\n\nRemember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and try to focus on finding solutions rather than placing blame.

We currently cohabit, and he gives me some money, but the flat is on my name, I pay rent from my account and the bills. In that time, I have also lost both of my parents and some friends, my grandmother moved back to Spain and I had a bad mental breakdown in September of last year, to the point where I was put on antidepressants, anxiety meds and  a sleeping tablet. I also am waiting for treatments for medical conditions I've carried for a bit. I also do all the work in the house, I clean, I cook, I liaise with the landlord whenever something goes wrong, I take care of our cats. When I ask my partner to do chores, his response is that I was the one who got the flat/I was the one who choose to own cats.\n\nMy partner also has struggled with Bipolar Disorder (he has manic and depressive cycles) and I was diagnosed with Cushing's. Cushing's is probably one of the worst things for anyone's sexual life, as my weight ballooned to over 300 pounds. So I became undesirable to his eyes and my own eyes.\n\nI have now started treatment for the Cushing's with medication (and if it doesn't work, I will need surgery) and have already lost 10 pounds, but I want to get back to how it was. I still haven't had sex in three years and I am only 28. I adore my partner and don't resent him, as my weight is largely the reason.\n\nBut it is destroying me psychologically. Our intimacy has fallen so much that right now we only cuddle. We have stopped kissing and making out altogether. I try to initiate, but he never gets hard and of course, he doesn't cum. He masturbates and watches porn, and we had to open our relationship because he wasn't getting sexual fulfillment. We don't even sleep in the same bedroom anymore. I sleep in the sofa in the living room, and he gets the bedroom (it's a one bedroom flat).\n\nToday, I asked him if he wanted anything for lunch. He took one look at me and said \"you look hideous\". He then said that he wanted to help me lose weight and that he would help me. But he's only working odd jobs here and there and I am the one putting the money and taking care of the house. Everything has gone up with inflation. I was so shocked when I heard him that I didn't even know how to react. I know I don't look great because of the weight, but even before I put on weight he would bring me down by saying I was overweight or my looks were average and a \"5/10\". I have always had great insecurity on how I look, as I've always been a chubby kid + socially awkward and not interested in most conversation due to my ADHD. \n\nI know our relationship is shit and I should kick him out. I am painfully aware of that. But I've recently lost my secondment and my salary has fallen to the point where I need the financial help he provides, no matter how insignificant it might be. I could afford my flat before, but the loss of salary + rising inflation in the UK has meant that I am already paying lower rent than average for my city (London) and that if I was to move, I wouldn't even find anything that much cheaper. \n\nTL;DR: Partner called me hideous",

It's understandable that you feel resentful and frustrated about this.\n\nGiven your financial situation, it's not surprising that you're hesitant to leave the relationship.

You might also want to consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about what you're going through.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that you're not alone in this.

I think when the phone call ended the world just seemed a lot more grim and grey to me. I put on an emotional mask while on the phone, and said that I would politely accept her decision to leave me because it would lead to her being happy (even if it was without me). But once the call ended I just felt numb and confused because she didn’t even give me an explanation as to why besides her “just not feeling it anymore”.\n\nI’ve already picked out my some TV shows, couple of movies, video games, and snacks to binge on while I lock myself up for a week to distract myself for a bit. Any advice or tips beyond that?",
    "human": "Talk to people. Hang out with friends and family who will help you get over your breakup. Don't try to hide your emotions, bottling them up never helps but at the same time don't try to dwell on the past.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear about your breakup. It's natural to feel numb and confused after such a significant loss, especially since it was your first breakup. Here are some additional tips to help you cope with the aftermath:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions**: It's essential to acknowledge and process your feelings, even if they're uncomfortable. Give yourself permission to grieve the loss of the relationship and the future you had envisioned with your ex. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or confused.\n2. **Practice self-care**: You've already taken the first step by planning some distractions, but make sure to prioritize self-care beyond just entertainment. Take care of your physical health by eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as meditation, yoga, or reading.\n3. **Reach out to friends and family**: Surround yourself with people who care about you and can offer emotional support. Share your feelings with trusted friends or family members, and don't be afraid to ask for help or advice. You don't have to go through this alone.\n4. **Take time to reflect**: While it's essential to focus on the present moment, it's also important to reflect on the relationship and your feelings. Think about what you learned, what you're grateful for, and what you might do differently in the future. This can help you gain closure and perspective.\n5. **Create a routine**: Establish a daily routine that provides structure and normalcy. This can help you feel more grounded and focused on the present rather than dwelling on the past. Try to maintain your regular schedule, including classes, work, or other activities that bring you purpose.\n6. **Don't rush into anything**: It's natural to feel the urge to fill the void left by the breakup, but resist the temptation to rush into a new relationship or rebound. Take the time to focus on yourself, heal, and learn to love and accept yourself before opening yourself up to someone else.\n7. **Consider journaling or writing**: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a powerful way to process your emotions and gain clarity. Try journaling, writing poetry, or even creating a breakup letter (even if you don't intend to send it).\n8. **Give yourself permission to take time off from social media**: Social media can be a significant source of stress and comparison, especially during a breakup. Take a break or limit your use to avoid feeling overwhelmed or triggered.\n9. **Practice forgiveness**: Forgiveness is a process, and it may take time. Try to work on forgiving yourself and your ex for any perceived wrongs or shortcomings. Holding onto resentment can weigh you down and prevent you from moving forward.\n10. **Remember that it's okay to not be okay**: Breakups can be messy and painful, and it's okay to not be okay. Allow yourself to feel the emotions and take the time you need to heal. You will get through this, and with time, you'll emerge stronger and wiser.\n\nRemember, healing from a breakup takes time, and it's a unique experience for everyone. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to seek help if you need it."

When we make mistakes, it's an opportunity to grow and become better versions of ourselves.\n\nHere are some strategies to help you reduce your mistakes:\n\n1. **Practice mindfulness**: Be more present in the moment, especially when doing tasks that require attention to detail.

This will help build your confidence and motivation.\n\nRemember, it's not about being perfect; it's about learning from your mistakes and becoming a better version of yourself.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. You're not defined by your mistakes, and you're capable of growth and improvement. Keep in mind that it's okay to make mistakes – it's a natural part of the learning process.\n\nHang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this struggle!"

    "sentence": "Parents Should Consider Being a Grinch with Expensive Gaming Systems if Kids Are Struggling with School Pandemic Parenting Pro-Tip: A lot of kids are really struggling with distance learning. If your kid is having a hard time getting grades that are up to your standards already then do not purchase them an expensive gaming computer that they probably really, really want for Christmas this year. And the same goes for a PS5 or other devices. \n\nI work as a cultural liaison at a school with about 1,000 students, I have my own kids, and I work with hundreds of other educators and it's really hard right now for everyone, including the parents who often seem to be left out of these conversations. I'm seeing more and more kids that just aren't mature enough to manage the temptation to game all day and balance it with their other responsibilities. This is causing a lot of problems for them. I have kids who may not graduate on time or at all because of this problem. I'm not saying it's the only problem or even the biggest problem, but it is affecting many of my students and being a Grinch with an expensive gaming system now might be a loving thing to do even if they are dissapointed.  The $200 utilitarian chromebook that your school (probably) provided is enough for them. If you really want to give them an awesome gaming system then put it away every day until they do their schoolwork and let them have it on evenings and weekends if they demonstrate adequate progress. And don't just take their word for it, verify it with the school using the parent portal that comes with your online learning software. \n\nOne technology splurge that would be nice is a good set of headphones with a microphone, but not those silly airpods, they just lose them or forget to charge them. I also think corded is better than bluetooth but if it's not \"cool\" the kid won't be caught dead wearing them. (This ain't my first rodeo).",
    "human": "I read your title and agreed with the message. The further down the post I got the more out of touch you seem. You lost me completely at the headphones. And then in your comments I’m pretty steadfast in disagreement. Instead of taking things away because you don’t think they can handle it, how ‘bout working with them so they can handle it?",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you're speaking from a place of experience and concern for the well-being of the students. I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. It's great that you're considering the potential long-term consequences of giving in to their desires for expensive gaming systems.\n\nI think it's crucial to prioritize setting boundaries and encouraging responsible behavior, especially during these challenging times. By limiting access to expensive gaming systems, you're not only protecting their academic performance but also teaching them valuable skills like self-regulation and time management.\n\nI also appreciate your suggestion to consider a utilitarian chromebook instead of an expensive gaming system. It's a practical and responsible decision that can help them stay on track with their schoolwork.\n\nThe idea of setting aside gaming time for evenings and weekends if they demonstrate adequate progress is a great compromise. It shows that you're willing to listen to their needs and provide some freedom, but also prioritize their academic responsibilities.\n\nRegarding the headphones, I agree that a good set with a microphone would be a thoughtful gift. Corded headphones might not be the most stylish option, but they're often more reliable and practical. Perhaps you could consider a compromise and get a corded headset with a cool design or color scheme that the kid would appreciate.\n\nOverall, your advice is spot on. It's refreshing to see someone prioritizing the well-being of the students and not just giving in to their demands. As a parent, it's not always easy to make tough decisions, but it's clear that you're doing what's best for your kids and the students you work with."

All this chatting and seeing each other happened while I was in a serious 5 year relationship, I made it clear for both my boyfriend (28) at the time and my friend that what I felt was attraction, we obviously had chemistry but never acted upon it.\n\nWhen I broke up with my ex-boyfriend, he reached out and we started chatting even more and we saw each other a couple of times recently, he confessed that he was very attracted to me as well and that he really liked me but, he understood that I was going through a break up and needed time to focus on myself.

It's not an easy decision, but it's a necessary one to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to the situation.

Be careful not to take verses out of context or use them to support an agenda.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, here are a few Bible verses that might be suitable for your Christmas cards:\n\n* \"Love is patient, love is kind.

The key is to learn to care without becoming consumed by it.

Are you catastrophizing or making assumptions? Try to find the humor or the absurdity in a situation.\n3. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" to things that drain your energy or cause unnecessary stress. You can't control everything, so focus on what you can control.\n4. **Find your why**: Connect with your values and passions. When you're doing something you love, you're more likely to stay present and enjoy the journey, rather than getting bogged down in seriousness.\n5. **Embrace imperfection**: Nobody's perfect, and that's okay. Accept that mistakes happen, and that they're an opportunity for growth.\n6. **Laugh at yourself**: Humor is a great way to diffuse tension and remind yourself not to take life too seriously. Watch a funny movie, read a humorous book, or hang out with people who make you laugh.\n7. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, just as you would a close friend. Be gentle with yourself when you make mistakes or have a bad day.\n8. **Take breaks**: Schedule time for relaxation and activities that bring you joy. Whether it's reading, taking a walk, or playing a game, make sure you're giving yourself time to unwind.\n9. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you. Avoid toxic relationships or environments that drain your energy.\n10. **Practice gratitude**: Reflect on the good things in your life, no matter how small they may seem. Focusing on the positive can help shift your perspective and reduce stress.\n\nRemember, it's a process to develop a more carefree attitude. Be patient and kind to yourself as you work on it."

She took me whitewater rafting once and sometimes we play video games together but before now I wouldn’t exactly call us close.\n\nA few months ago I had to be hospitalized for 6 weeks with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. While I was hospital, Selena visited me literally every day (except for the time I spent in the ICU where I wasn’t allowed non family visitors). I’m wasn’t really sure why, because like I said we weren’t all that close (she says she thought I must be feeling pretty scared and alone and that she’d want someone to be there for her).

For example, \"I feel frustrated when...\" instead of \"You always...\"\n4. **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Try to separate the problem from the person. Avoid personal attacks or criticisms. Stick to the issue at hand and work together to find a solution.\n5. **Prepare ahead of time**: If you know a difficult conversation is coming up, prepare by thinking about your goals, concerns, and potential solutions. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.\n6. **Seek common ground**: Look for areas of agreement and try to find a mutually beneficial solution. This can help to diffuse tension and build trust.\n7. **Practice assertiveness**: Learn to express your needs and boundaries assertively, without being aggressive or passive. This can help you feel more confident and respected in your interactions.\n8. **Develop empathy**: Try to put yourself in others' shoes and understand their perspective. This can help you navigate conflicts more effectively and build stronger relationships.\n9. **Take a break if needed**: If the conversation is becoming too heated or overwhelming, it's okay to take a break and revisit the issue when you're both feeling calmer.\n10. **Seek support**: Surround yourself with people who support and encourage you. Having a strong support network can help you feel more confident and prepared to handle difficult conversations.\n\nRemember, improving your ability to handle conflict and confrontation takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With time and effort, you can develop the skills you need to navigate these situations more effectively.\n\nWhat do you think?

The majority of my coworkers either are married w/young children (e.g. they go home right after work and never care to socialize) or they're a couple of years from retirement, whereas I'm in my 20s. All my close friends have moved and/or are busy starting a family. I find myself trying to find new people to hang out with, but not exactly sure how to go about doing that without being a total creeper.",
    "human": "This is a very good question, OP. \n\nI believe it is MUCH harder these days to make new friends as an adult, compared to how it used to be before the internet. \n\nEven I remember when I was young, adult strangers used to talk to eachother in public all the time.  Things were slower in the early 90s, you would go to the grocery store and people would always chat up others about random things in life.  Girls would actually talk to guys too, without immediately giving off the 'go away creeper' vibe. \n\nIt seemed that ever since online dating became mainstream in the early 2000's, all of this changed.  Suddenly everyone just lived their life through the filter of the internet.  Public exchanges were suddenly dangerous.  Everyone was suspect, and it's just best to meet someone online first because you can filter out your dislikes immediately. \n\nYou think it's bad now, you're still in your 20's.  Wait until your mid 30's and onward.   I suggest you hit up college bars around midnight on the weekends.  You will find new friends.  But not when you're 35.   It gets harder and harder, especially when you grew up in a world where strangers actually liked meeting new people in public, and you aren't very savvy or keen with online dating.",
    "base_reply": "The struggles of making new friends as an adult! It can be tough, especially when you're not fitting into the usual social circles. I'm here to offer some advice that's honest and practical, without being too cheesy or pushy.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that making new friends takes time and effort. It's not something that happens overnight, and it's okay to start small. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Join a club or group that aligns with your interests**: This could be a book club, a sports team, a hiking group, or any other activity that you're passionate about. This way, you'll be surrounded by people who share your interests, making it easier to strike up conversations and build connections.\n2. **Attend events and gatherings**: Look for events in your community, such as concerts, festivals, or networking events. These can be great opportunities to meet new people in a casual setting. Just remember to be genuine and respectful in your interactions.\n3. **Volunteer**: Helping others through volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people while doing something good for your community. You can search for opportunities on websites like VolunteerMatch or Idealist.\n4. **Take a class or workshop**: Enroll in a cooking class, language course, or art class. Not only will you learn something new, but you'll also be surrounded by people who share your interests.\n5. **Be open and friendly**: When you do meet new people, be yourself, and don't be afraid to strike up conversations. Ask questions, listen actively, and show genuine interest in others.\n\nAs for being a \"total creeper,\" remember that people are generally more open to new connections than you might think. Just be respectful of boundaries and don't be pushy or overbearing. Here are a few tips to avoid being a creeper:\n\n* Don't try to gather too much personal information too quickly. People appreciate boundaries, so respect them.\n* Don't monopolize conversations. Listen actively and let others share their thoughts and experiences.\n* Don't be overly aggressive or persistent. If someone isn't interested in talking or hanging out, respect their decision and move on.\n\nLastly, remember that making new friends is a process, and it may take some time. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on building genuine connections, and with time, you'll find people who share your interests and values.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you get started on your journey to making new friends!"

You can also check your insurance provider's website or call their customer service to confirm.\n2. **Get a clear understanding of your care team**: Ask your surgeon or primary care physician who will be involved in your care, including assistants, anesthesiologists, and other specialists. This will help you identify potential out-of-network providers.\n3. **Check the hospital's website or patient portal**: Many hospitals have online directories or patient portals where you can search for provider credentials and network status.

Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for out-of-network providers to participate in care without patient consent or notification. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:\n\n* Insurance changes or updates\n* Provider changes or staffing issues\n* Lack of transparency or communication\n\nYou may want to consider the following:\n\n* **File a complaint**: Report the incident to your insurance provider, the hospital, and the relevant state medical board. This can help bring attention to the issue and potentially lead to changes in policies or procedures.\n* **Seek a second opinion**: If you're concerned about the quality of care or the involvement of out-of-network providers, consider seeking a second opinion from an in-network specialist.\n* **Review your insurance policy**: Understand your policy's coverage and network provisions to ensure you're aware of any potential gaps or limitations.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being by being an active participant in your care.

However, it's crucial to address the underlying power dynamics in your relationship.\n\nThe fact that your wife views the household income as \"her money\" and \"her house\" is a significant issue. It's not about being equal-sided, but about recognizing that you're both partners in this relationship. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about how this dynamic is affecting you.\n\nHere's a suggestion: schedule a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your wife. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example:\n\n\"I feel undervalued and unappreciated when I'm not contributing financially. I want to feel like an equal partner in our relationship. Can we find a way to make this work?\"\n\nRegarding the dead bedroom, it's likely a symptom of the deeper issues in your relationship.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.

Given your situation, it's essential to approach this with a nuanced understanding of the underlying dynamics at play.\n\nThe four horsemen of the apocalypse, as described by John Gottman, are a great place to start. These are criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling. It's crucial to recognize when you and your wife are slipping into these patterns and make a conscious effort to avoid them.\n\nTo improve your communication, consider the following:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When your wife speaks, make an effort to truly hear what she's saying, both verbally and non-verbally. Repeat back what you've understood to ensure you're on the same page. This can help prevent miscommunication and reduce defensiveness.\n2. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of blaming your wife for problems, express your feelings and thoughts using \"I\" statements. This helps to avoid criticism and promotes a sense of ownership. For example, \"I feel frustrated when...\" instead of \"You always...\"\n3. **Avoid blaming and generalizing**: Try to focus on specific behaviors or actions that are causing the issue, rather than making broad accusations or attributing blame. This can help to reduce defensiveness and promote a more constructive conversation.\n4. **Show appreciation and gratitude**: Make an effort to acknowledge and appreciate your wife's positive contributions to your relationship. This can help to create a more positive atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of conflict.\n5. **Emotional validation**: Recognize and validate your wife's emotions, even if you don't agree with her perspective.

This can help you both calm down and approach the conversation with a clearer head.\n7. **Seek outside help if needed**: If you find that your conflicts are becoming too frequent or intense, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A professional can provide you with personalized guidance and support to improve your communication skills and work through underlying issues.\n\nRegarding your personalities, understanding each other's love languages and personality types can be beneficial. The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman and the Big Five Personality Traits can provide valuable insights into your individual needs and preferences. However, keep in mind that these frameworks are not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it's essential to approach them with a critical and nuanced perspective.\n\nRemember, improving communication is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with each other, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Focus on building a stronger, more empathetic connection, and you'll be well on your way to improving your communication skills."

I live in the apartment during exams with my younger sister and my parents live in the house with our youngest sister. I was having a video call with my mom (F53), and she thought I had rolled my eyes at her. Truth be told, I was nervous during the conversation and wasn't on my best behavior. She blocked me immediately after the call. Two days later, my mom drove over to the apartment at 3 AM to kick me out.\n\nI called up a friend to pick me up and immediately found a place to live from that point on. I live with two girls at the moment, but I sleep on the couch. I pay for my rent and I take no money from my parents. My parents have invited me back to live with them, and I am grateful for the offer, but I can't afford to have to wonder if I'm going to be kicked out again over some non-existent reason.\n\nI always had a kind of rough relationship with my mom, and the other parent is quite disinterested. She is now trying to pretend that \"getting kicked out\" was never the plan - that she drove 30 mins at 3 AM and that she actually....had no plan? And that getting kicked out was my idea, and that I welcomed the idea with open arms. She claims that she regretted kicking me out instantly and that she sent my little sister after me when I left. My family never wants to speak about these incidents, because they never have any arguments which excuse kicking me out. It happened the first time when I was 18 (to this day I haven't been told a single concrete reason other than: \"You were rude\"), and there were always threats of getting kicked out sprinkled between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFast forward to today, and my question - I am moving in with my boyfriend (22M) of three months. We found a place, planned everything out, even started buying some stuff for the apartment. The move is definitely happening. However, when I told my little sister (19F) about this, she freaked out and even got mad at me for moving in with a boyfriend.

It might be helpful to have a plan in place for how you'll address their concerns and boundaries.\n\nHere's a suggestion: consider having a calm and respectful conversation with your parents when you're feeling centered and prepared. Be honest about your feelings and reasons for moving in with your boyfriend, and be open to listening to their concerns. It's possible they might surprise you and be more understanding than you expect.\n\nRemember, you don't owe your parents an explanation or justification for your choices, but being open and honest can help clear the air and potentially improve your relationship.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being. If your parents do react poorly, be prepared to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. You deserve to be respected and loved, regardless of your choices.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to talk more about how to approach this conversation or any other aspect of this situation?"

    "human": "My advice: Maintain your dignity. Focus on yourself and on things you have always wanted to do but couldn't while in a relationship.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It can be really tough to navigate a breakup, especially when there are still strong feelings involved.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to still care about your ex. It doesn't mean you're not over the relationship or that you're not ready to move on. It's natural to have lingering emotions after a significant investment like a year-long relationship.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that your ex has made it clear that she doesn't feel the same way. The \"friend zone\" label often means that she doesn't see you as a romantic partner, and it's essential to respect her boundaries.\n\nInstead of dwelling on the what-ifs or trying to change her mind, I recommend taking this opportunity to focus on yourself. Ask yourself what you learned from the relationship, what you're proud of, and what you'd like to work on personally. This can be a great chance to grow and become a better version of yourself.\n\nIt might also be helpful to create some distance between you and your ex, not just physically but also emotionally. Try not to constantly reach out or wait for her to initiate contact. This will help you both move forward and give you space to heal.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to take your time to process your emotions, and it's okay to still care about your ex. Just be patient, kind, and compassionate towards yourself as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nRemember, you deserve someone who sees you as a partner, not just a friend. Keep your heart open, and the right person will come along when the time is right."

Here's a simple yet effective approach:\n\nFirst, acknowledge that it's okay to not have control over everything. Life is unpredictable, and sometimes things just happen. Instead of beating yourself up over things that are outside your control, focus on what you can control – your reactions and responses to those situations.\n\nNext, set boundaries. Learn to say \"no\" to things that drain your energy and say \"yes\" to things that nourish your mind, body, and soul. Don't take on too much, and prioritize your well-being.\n\nNow, here's a game-changer: practice mindfulness. When you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, take a deep breath in, and out. Focus on the present moment, and let go of worries about the past or future. You can also try meditation, yoga, or any other mindfulness practice that resonates with you.\n\nAnother strategy is to reframe your thinking. When you catch yourself worrying about something that's outside your control, challenge those thoughts by asking yourself: \"Is this thought serving me?\" If not, let it go. Replace it with a more positive, empowering thought.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as planned.\n\nRemember, my friend, it's a journey, not a destination. It takes time and practice to develop this mindset, but trust me, it's worth it. You got this!"

I usually initiate it and tell her that if there are times she’s in the mood that I haven’t initiated, she is welcome to start something and I will usually be happy to go along. However, she is really bad at it, and then is upset when I “reject her.” Here are some examples:\n\n\nI’m working in the office, GF comes in and says “hey is there anything you want for lunch?” And I say “idk I’ll probably make pasta or a sandwich or something”. She then looks disappointed and leaves. The rest of the day, she is pouty and sad. I ask what’s up and she says that eating lunch was supposed to be code for having sex during our lunch break.\n\n\nAfter work, I usually do chores for a bit before we work on dinner. I was washing dishes when GF came back from the store. She says “I’m gonna go change” because she is wearing normal clothes and prefers to wear sweatpants-type stuff when lounging around the house. I say ok and she goes into the bedroom with the door closed. I do chores for like ten minutes and then she comes out of the room all annoyed, saying that she wanted me to come in while she was changing and start sexy times. How was I supposed to know that? Changing after getting home is not an abnormal thing to me.\n\n\nGF goes for a bike ride and gets home all sweaty. She says she’s going to shower, I’m like ok cool. When she is done, she says that she is disappointed I didn’t come join her in the shower. This is despite our shower not being very roomy and her turning me down for shower activity together in the past, explicitly because there’s not much room for 2 people.\n\n\nI have told her that she needs to be more direct if she wants to signal that she wants sex, but she is not getting better and it is quite frustrating when she starts pouting just because I don’t pick up on the signals. She has said that she wants the person that she is with to just know when she’s in the mood, but I am not a mind reader and feel like she’s saying things that people might say all the time in a normal setting. How can I improve this?\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: GF is not good at telling me she wants sex, saying things like “what do you want for lunch” and thinking that’s a pickup line, then is annoyed when I am not picking up on it.",
    "human": "&gt;I am not a mind reader and feel like she’s saying things that people might say all the time in a normal setting. How can I improve this?\n\nEasy. Respond to everything she says with 'are you asking for sex?'\n\nWhen she's fed up with that, have another conversation about your lack of mind reading abilities, and let her know that if she wants something from you that is not what she is saying it is, she needs to stop beating around the bush and say what she really means.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It can be frustrating when there's a mismatch in communication styles, especially when it comes to something as intimate as sex.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for being honest with your girlfriend about needing more direct communication. It's great that you're acknowledging that you're not a mind reader and that it's not fair to expect you to magically know when she's in the mood.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of simply telling her to be more direct, why not try having a conversation with her about what specifically is not working for you? You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I want to talk to you about our sex life. I've noticed that sometimes you seem to be hinting at wanting to have sex, but it's not always clear to me. For example, when you asked me what I wanted for lunch, I didn't catch the hint. Could we work on finding ways to communicate our desires more clearly? Maybe we could set aside a specific time each week for us to talk about our desires and boundaries around sex?\"\n\nBy framing it as a conversation about communication rather than simply telling her to change her behavior, you're more likely to get a constructive and collaborative response. Additionally, by suggesting a specific solution (setting aside a time to talk about desires and boundaries), you're offering a concrete way for you both to work on improving your communication.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to set boundaries and communicate your own desires and needs clearly. You could say something like:\n\n\"I love you and I value our sex life, but I need you to be more direct with me. When you say something like 'what do you want for lunch,' it's not clear to me that you're looking for something more. Could you please find a way to signal to me when you're in the mood? Maybe we could even set up a code or a specific phrase that we use to initiate intimacy.\"\n\nBy being clear and direct about your own needs, you're giving your girlfriend a chance to understand what you're looking for and to adjust her behavior accordingly.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to have a conversation about what constitutes a \"normal\" or \"normal setting\" for initiating intimacy. What does she mean by that? Is there a specific context or situation that she's looking for? Clarifying these expectations can help you both get on the same page and avoid misunderstandings.\n\nRemember to approach this conversation with empathy and an open mind. It's possible that your girlfriend is not intentionally trying to be confusing or frustrating, and that there are underlying issues or insecurities that are contributing to her behavior. By working together and communicating openly, you can find a solution that works for both of you."

Focus on the facts: Share your concerns about the industry and the company, focusing on the facts rather than personal opinions. For example, you could say, \"I've done some research on multi-level marketing schemes, and I'm concerned about the potential pitfalls and high failure rates. I've also noticed that the products seem to be priced higher than similar products on the market.\"\n3. Avoid being judgmental: Refrain from making assumptions or using language that implies your friends are stupid or gullible. Instead, focus on the specific concerns you have about the business model. You could say, \"I'm worried that the emphasis on recruiting new members and hosting parties might not be a sustainable way to make a living. Have you considered the long-term viability of this business?\"\n4. Encourage critical thinking: Ask your friends to think critically about the opportunity and consider the potential risks. You could ask questions like, \"What are your expectations for this business, and how do you plan to measure its success?\" or \"Have you considered the potential financial and emotional risks involved?\"\n5. Offer support: Let your friends know that you're there to support them, regardless of their decision. You could say, \"I'm here for you, and I want to support you in whatever you decide. If you're not happy with the outcome, I'm here to listen and help you figure out what's next.\"\n\nHere's an example script to help you get started:\n\n\"Hey [Friend's Name], I wanted to talk to you about Younique. I've noticed you're really into it, and I'm happy to see you're exploring new opportunities. However, I do have some concerns about the industry and the company. From what I've researched, multi-level marketing schemes can be tricky, and the products seem to be priced higher than similar products on the market. I'm worried that the emphasis on recruiting new members and hosting parties might not be a sustainable way to make a living. Have you considered the long-term viability of this business? I'm here to support you, and I want to help you think critically about this opportunity. What are your expectations for this business, and how do you plan to measure its success?\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, empathetic, and non-judgmental during the conversation.

Encourage her to explore options for a trip with her loved ones, and offer to help plan and budget as you previously suggested.\n4. **Set boundaries**: It's essential to set clear boundaries and communicate your needs. Let your girlfriend know that you understand her frustration, but you also need to prioritize your family relationships. Explain that you're not trying to exclude her, but you do need to spend time with your family.\n5. **Find a compromise**: Depending on the situation, consider finding a compromise, such as planning a small family gathering or activity with your girlfriend during the vacation, if possible.

Avoid getting defensive or dismissive, as this can escalate the situation. By acknowledging her feelings, reiterating your explanation, and finding a compromise, you can work together to find a solution that respects both your needs and your relationship.\n\nLastly, consider having this conversation when you're both relatively calm and not in the midst of an argument.

Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid making assumptions about her intentions. For example, \"I feel a bit awkward when she looks at me in a certain way/I feel like she's not making an effort to include me in conversations.\" This will help him understand your perspective and potentially work together to find a solution.\n2. **Respect her boundaries**: It's essential to respect his daughter's feelings and boundaries. If she's not comfortable around you, try not to take it personally and avoid pushing the issue. Instead, focus on building a positive relationship with her by showing genuine interest in her life, listening to her concerns, and being respectful of her space.\n3. **Find common ground**: Try to find activities or topics that you both enjoy or have in common with his daughter. This can help create a sense of connection and make interactions less awkward. You could ask her about her interests, hobbies, or passions and show genuine interest in getting to know her better.\n4. **Set boundaries**: Discuss with your boyfriend what boundaries you're comfortable with regarding your interactions with his daughter. For example, you might want to establish some alone time or set limits on how often you spend time together. Communicate these boundaries clearly and respectfully with his daughter and your boyfriend.\n5. **Focus on building a positive relationship with his daughter**: Instead of trying to change her behavior or attitude, focus on building a positive relationship with her. Show her that you're a kind, caring, and responsible person by being respectful, empathetic, and genuine. This might take time, but it can help improve the dynamic between you three.\n6. **Consider a mediated conversation**: If the situation persists and you're not seeing any improvement, consider having a mediated conversation with his daughter, your boyfriend, and a neutral third party (like a therapist or trusted family friend). This can help facilitate open and constructive communication and provide a safe space for everyone to express their feelings and concerns.\n\nRemember, improving relationships takes time, effort, and patience. Focus on building trust, respect, and empathy, and try not to take things personally."

Keep the conversation light and engaging, and make sure to ask follow-up questions about her interests.\n2. **Respect her boundaries**: Don't push for physical intimacy if she's not comfortable. Pay attention to her body language and verbal cues, and respect her boundaries.\n3. **Offer a nightcap**: If the evening is going well, consider offering a nightcap at your place. This can be a great way to keep the evening going and build a connection.\n\nOverlooked details:\n\n1. **Have a plan for parking**: Make sure you have a plan for parking, whether it's a designated spot or a nearby garage.

Own your space and be yourself, but avoid coming across as arrogant or entitled.\n3. **Pay attention to the little things**: Notice the little details about your date, like her favorite drink or the way she laughs. This shows you're paying attention and care about her as a person.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful date night is to be genuine, respectful, and considerate. Focus on building a connection with your date, and don't try to be someone you're not. Good luck!"

    "sentence": "Is my girlfriend toxic or am I just overreacting?\nHello,\n\nMy girlfriend, about 2 weeks ago, asked if I would be interested in going on a trip to Mexico with her. As a young person who doesn’t have the most amount of expendable money to their name and is trying to save up as much money possible over the next couple of years to begin the process of purchasing my own home, I told her I’m not sure it would be the best idea financially for me. Fortunately though, I do have a job that pays out bonuses! An average bonus can be around $2000 after taxes, which so happens to be just about the amount each of us would pay to go to Mexico. Knowing this, I told her if I got a bonus of at least $2000 this quarter, I would be fine going to Mexico! She agreed. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks. I now know that I will be receiving at least $2000 on my bonus. \n\nExpecting her to be happy, as she loves going to Mexico, I told her that I’m willing to go to Mexico since I have the extra cash on hand. Unexpectedly, she said she no longer wants to go due to the fact that “It’s not fair that I’ve been handed a bonus check and that she would have to work to save up the money”. \n\nIn my opinion, it shouldn’t matter how I got the money. If she was perfectly fine with working to get the money before she knew I received my bonus, she should be perfectly fine working after she knew I got the bonus. \n\nPlease tell me if you agree with me or not and why. I’d love to know everyone’s honest opinion.",
    "human": "Sounds like maybe she was hoping you'd pay for both of you to go again. So then when she was told you got the bonus to pay for your half of the trip she realized that wasn't happening? Maybe. Seems pretty entitled at the very least.",
    "base_reply": "I think it's important to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and confused about the situation. It sounds like you're trying to make a responsible financial decision, and you're being transparent about your financial situation.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider your girlfriend's perspective. Her reaction doesn't necessarily mean she's toxic, but it does suggest that there might be some underlying issues in your relationship.\n\nIt's possible that your girlfriend was initially okay with the idea of working together to save up for the trip because she didn't expect you to get a bonus. When you told her you were going to get a bonus, it may have triggered feelings of resentment or frustration because she feels like you're getting a free pass while she's still having to work hard to save up.\n\nIt's not necessarily about the money itself, but about the perceived unfairness and the lack of shared effort. Your girlfriend might be feeling like you're not pulling your weight in the relationship, and that you're not considering her financial struggles.\n\nIt's worth having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling and what you think is fair. You could ask her to explain her perspective and what she's feeling, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nIt's also important to consider whether this is a one-time issue or if it's a pattern in your relationship. Are there other times when you've felt like you're not being heard or considered in your financial decisions? Are there other ways in which you feel like you're not being a team in your relationship?\n\nUltimately, it's not just about whether or not you're overreacting or if your girlfriend is toxic. It's about communicating effectively, being empathetic, and working together to find solutions that work for both of you."

This is one of those times—this year has been extremely hard on me and I’m in a really low spot. I don’t need to be reminded of how inadequate and miserable I am compared to people I share a lot of DNA with. \n\nSo all month I’ve literally been worrying myself sick about an upcoming get-together—I’ll stay up all night worrying, give myself head and stomach aches, and my heart will beat so hard that I can feel and hear it. I have felt nauseated at some point on most days and have had to stop what I’m doing and take deep breaths to get back to “normal.”\n\nI know I’ll start to feel a lot better if I can just avoid this obligation altogether.\n\nHere’s the hard part, though: I live in the house where the get-together is being held. And I can’t use work as an excuse to not be there. What can I do to avoid this situation? I have no problem with staying locked up in my bedroom the whole time—I just need a good excuse to be able to do so.",

I'm here to help you find a solution that prioritizes your well-being.\n\nFirstly, acknowledging that you're struggling with feelings of inadequacy and misery compared to your family members is a huge step forward. It takes courage to admit these emotions, and I'm here to assure you that you're not alone.\n\nGiven your constraints, I understand that using work as an excuse won't work. Here's a more creative approach:\n\nConsider reaching out to a family member, preferably someone you're close to, and have an open and honest conversation about your feelings. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey [family member], I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming gathering. To be honest, this year has been really tough for me, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'm worried that being around everyone might make me feel even more anxious and down. Would it be okay if I take some time for myself during the gathering? Maybe I could stay in my room for a bit, or help out with some tasks around the house? I value our family time, but I need to prioritize my own well-being right now.\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're acknowledging your feelings, taking responsibility for your emotions, and asking for understanding. It's possible that your family member will be more understanding and supportive than you think.\n\nIf you're not comfortable having this conversation, or if you're worried about being judged or criticized, you could consider writing a heartfelt letter or email to your family member(s) explaining your situation. This can help you express your feelings without having to have an in-person conversation.\n\nRemember, taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's essential. By prioritizing your well-being, you'll be better equipped to handle future challenges and maintain a healthier relationship with your family.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your thinking around the gathering. Instead of viewing it as an obligation, see it as an opportunity to recharge and connect with your family in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you. You might find that being honest about your feelings can lead to a deeper understanding and connection with your loved ones."

Here are some tips to help you turn the conversation around and make it more engaging:\n\n1. **Show genuine interest**: When the other person says they're from the same town, respond with something like: \"That's great! What do you like most about living here?\" or \"What's your favorite part about this city?\" This shows you're interested in their experience and opens the door for them to share more.\n2. **Ask follow-up questions**: If you've lived in the city for four years, you must have some favorite spots or experiences. Share those! For example: \"I've been loving trying out new restaurants downtown lately. Have you discovered any hidden gems?\" or \"I've been meaning to visit the local park more often. Do you have a favorite hiking trail?\"\n3. **Find common ground**: If you can't think of something specific to ask about the city, try finding a common interest or experience. For instance: \"I've been trying to get into [hiking/biking/reading]. Are you into any outdoor activities?\" or \"I've been following [local sports team]. Are you a fan?\"\n4. **Talk about your experience as an expat**: Since you're from another country, you have a unique perspective on the city. Share a funny or interesting story about adjusting to life in the city. For example: \"I still get lost in the one-way streets sometimes. How about you, do you have any favorite navigation hacks?\" or \"I've been trying to learn more about the local culture. Have you discovered any great cultural events or festivals?\"\n5. **Keep it light and casual**: Remember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to interview the other person. Keep the tone light and friendly, and be willing to share your own experiences and thoughts.\n\nHere's an example of how you could put these tips together:\n\nNew person: \"I'm from here.\"\nYou: \"That's great! What do you like most about living here?\"\nNew person: \"The food scene is amazing.\"\nYou: \"Totally agree! I've been trying out new restaurants downtown lately. Have you discovered any hidden gems?\"\n\nBy following these tips, you can turn a simple \"where are you from\" conversation into a more engaging and meaningful exchange. Good luck!"

    "sentence": "I am 39 (M), she is 38 (F). No kids in picture yet. We have been married for over 10 years and, specially in the past 5 or so, I feel overwhelmed and not supported on my relationship. \n\nI was not exactly a healthy or organized person when we got married, but adult live grew into me. I became an athlete, got my health together, became a much more focused person in general. If there was a bar test for adulthood, I think I would do it pretty well in general. \n\nOn the opposite side, my wife, who was ADHD, went into the opposite direction. Her lack of focus, discipline and organization reached amazing levels and it has been really hard to deal with. This increase first angered me, but now I can't even get angry anymore. I just feel desolated, not supported and overwhelmed - as if I was constantly taking care of her. \n\nWe have reached a point in our lives in which we have to decide wether we are going to have kids or not. And everything I hear from people who are married with ADHDs is that it really gets worse when the person with ADHD has kids. Today, I already feel overwhelmed beign the main person responsible for the chores, for waking her up, for stopping her from buy too much junk food, for helping her control her weight, for let her spend too much money, for taking care of feeding and cleaning our pets. When I think of adding a kid to this mix, I just feel paralyzed. \n\nWe have tried in many different ways and forms to take care of this situation (she does not take meds), had lots of talks, tried lots of strategies, but it simply doesnt work. If I have a business trip of over a week, I come back to a house with clothes everywhere, piles of dish and a generally not clean environment. If I don't actively supervise her finances, she will blow our combined sallaries in the most irrational ways possible. \n\nI will not lie, this also affects my attraction for her. Since I do take care of myself, I look much younger than my age. I'm fit, I go to the gym everyday, I run half-marathons. By not taking care of herself, my wife, on the other hand, looks like a much older person. \n\nSaying all of that, you probably think I really dislike or hate my wife, but I do not. We have amazing memories together, she is very kind and loving to me. She also went through a disease that deeply scarred her body, so I know she would feel very abandoned and insecure with other people if I left her. And the thought of making her sad eats me from the inside. But all these years of feeling unsupported really wore me out. I don't feel like I love her, I feel like I take care of her. \n\nI am struggling to have a real talk with her. To let her know I plan to give us some time or to end this relationship. But I also feel some sort of pre-suvivor's guilt, like I am abandoning a helpless individual. \n\nI'm sorry, I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice. I just wanted to share these thoughts and hear back from people who went through the same. \n\n**TLDR**: wife of + 10 years has ADHD, beign getting worse. I feel alone, overwhelmed and I want to have kids, but I don't think I could do it with her.",

    "base_reply": "Wow, thank you for sharing your story with me. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about your feelings and struggles. I'm here to offer you a listening ear and some perspective, not to judge or tell you what to do.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people in similar situations struggle to find a balance in their relationships, and it's okay to admit that you're overwhelmed. It's not about not loving your wife; it's about feeling like you're carrying the weight of the relationship on your shoulders.\n\nRegarding your concerns about having kids, it's understandable that you're worried about adding to the stress and chaos. It's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and consider what's best for you. You deserve to have a partner who is equally invested in your life and willing to work together to maintain a healthy relationship.\n\nAs you consider having a conversation with your wife, I want to suggest a few things:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires.\n2. **Focus on your feelings**: Instead of blaming your wife or her ADHD, try to identify how you feel and what you need from the relationship. This can help you communicate your needs more effectively.\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: When discussing your concerns with your wife, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming language. For example, \"I feel overwhelmed when I come home to a messy house\" instead of \"You're always leaving the mess for me to clean up.\"\n4. **Explore solutions together**: Instead of focusing on what's not working, try to find ways to work together to improve your relationship and daily life. This might involve seeking couples therapy, setting boundaries, or finding ways to support each other's strengths and weaknesses.\n5. **Consider your own needs**: If you feel like you're sacrificing your own happiness and well-being for the sake of the relationship, it may be necessary to re-evaluate what's best for you. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires.\n\nRemember, you're not abandoning your wife by considering your own needs. You're taking care of yourself and your relationship by being honest and open about what you need to thrive.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" your wife's ADHD or make her take medication. You can't control her choices or behavior, but you can control how you respond to them. By prioritizing your own well-being and communicating your needs, you're taking a crucial step towards a healthier, more balanced relationship.\n\nTake your time, be patient, and remember that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your relationship."

    "base_reply": "The eternal conundrum! It's great that you're taking a step back to reassess your approach. I'm here to help you make sense of it all.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for being honest about your efforts and intentions. That takes a lot of courage. Now, let's break down what's been going on.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to lose interest, especially in the early stages of dating. It's possible that the girls you've been interested in haven't been the right match for you, or maybe you're not yet ready to receive what you're looking for.\n\nBefore we dive into specific advice, I want to ask: Have you noticed any patterns or common traits among the girls you've dated? Are there any specific reasons why they might have lost interest? Was it something you did, or was it something about them?\n\nRegarding your current situation, I'd say it's worth taking a closer look at the girl you're interested in now. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you genuinely connecting with her on a deeper level, or is it just surface-level attraction?\n2. Are there any red flags or warning signs that might indicate she's not interested or compatible?\n3. Have you been too focused on the excitement of the new relationship and not paying attention to the signs?\n\nIf you've been genuinely connecting with this girl, it might be worth exploring the relationship further. However, if you're sensing any of the same patterns or red flags from your previous experiences, it might be wise to take a step back and reevaluate.\n\nAs for taking a break from dating altogether, I'd say it's not necessarily a bad idea. Sometimes, we need to take a step back and focus on ourselves, our own growth, and what we want from a relationship. Use this time to reflect on what you're looking for in a partner, what you're willing to compromise on, and what you're not willing to settle for.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and focus on yourself. It's better to wait for the right person than to settle for someone who doesn't align with your values or goals.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself. You're not a failure just because you haven't found the right match yet. Everyone goes through ups and downs in dating, and it's all part of the journey.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything specific that's been holding you back or anything you'd like to add to this conversation?"

I accepted, kinda feeling maybe it was too fast but excited.\n\nThe day he asked me to be his girlfriend he asked for us to go on vacation together and I respectfully said i was not comfortable with that at this point. We have been oficialy gf/bf for a week and he has jokingly said he wants to marry me, he also said (not jokingly) he wants me to be forever with him, and that he loves me. I was pretty taken aback with him saying he loves me.\n\nSo, this friday he was coming to my state. I asked if we were gonna see each other and he said yes and that I should sleep over at his place, I respectfully declined because I am not comfortable with that yet as I am only getting to know him (important: I live in with my parents and I have a very conservative family, I am pretty conservative too). \n\nHe kinda got angry so I called him over the phone and explained that I like him a lot and I enjoy him being my boyfriend but I am not comfortable with that yet. He answered \"yea, I get it, I understand, Im not dumb huh\" pretty rudely to my explanations. He also got annoyed that the call was having some issues and ended it abruptly. I told him I didnt appreciate how he talked to me and he got annoyed and told me I was too gripped on a little thing and that I should just let it go. \n\nFriday came and he stopped texting me in the morning, never told me if he had arrived nor made an effort to see me.\n\nI am pretty confused. I do not like to be made to feel as if I am crazy or exagerating when explaining my point of view or disagreeing. I feel that I was reasonable and kind. Also, he is telling me really intense things and we dont know each other that well.\n\nI think at this point it is easier to break up, than figure out what is happening.\n\nI want advice on what possible actions I can take or what your outake on this is\n\nTLDR: boyfiend of a week has been joking about marriage, asking me to go on vacations and sleep over.

It's also understandable that you're hesitant to compromise on your values and boundaries, especially considering your conservative upbringing and family dynamics.\n\nIt's concerning that he got angry and dismissive when you expressed your concerns. His reaction suggests that he may not be respecting your boundaries or valuing your feelings. When someone says they \"understand\" but then gets defensive and annoyed, it often means they're not truly listening or willing to compromise.\n\nIt's also noteworthy that he stopped texting you after your disagreement, which may indicate that he's not interested in working through the issues or communicating openly.\n\nGiven these red flags, it's not unreasonable to consider ending the relationship. You've already tried communicating your concerns, and he's shown that he's not willing to listen or respect your boundaries.\n\nBefore making a decision, take some time to reflect on what you want and need from a partner. Ask yourself:\n\n1. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? Are you comfortable with the level of intimacy and commitment he's proposing?\n2.

Here's the thing: it's not about being an \"A-Hole\" or trying to one-up your friends, but rather, it's often a sign of insecurity or a need for validation.\n\nTo be less of a \"bragger\" and more of a genuine friend, try this:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When your friends share their experiences, truly listen and show genuine interest. Ask follow-up questions and acknowledge their accomplishments. This will help you focus on others and build deeper connections.\n2. **Reframe your conversations**: Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own experiences and what you've learned. Share your stories, but do it in a way that's humble and relatable. Avoid using superlatives like \"best\" or \"most\" when describing your accomplishments.\n3. **Celebrate others' successes**: When your friends share their good news, genuinely congratulate them and show enthusiasm. This will help you shift your focus from yourself to others and create a more positive, supportive environment.\n4. **Be aware of your body language**: Make sure your nonverbal cues are on point. Avoid crossing your arms, leaning away, or making other defensive body language that can give the impression you're trying to one-up others.\n5. **Take a step back and reflect**: After conversations, take a moment to reflect on how you came across. Ask yourself if you were trying to impress or prove something. If so, try to identify the underlying reasons and work on addressing those insecurities.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Remind yourself that it's okay to have accomplishments and be proud of them. Acknowledge your feelings, but also recognize that bragging is not an effective way to build meaningful relationships.\n\nRemember, it's a process to change habits, so be patient and kind to yourself. With time and effort, you can develop a more balanced and genuine approach to sharing your experiences with your friends."

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through a tough spot. It's great that you're taking steps to improve your situation. Getting a reliable car can be a huge game-changer.\n\nGiven your situation, I'd recommend exploring a few options:\n\n1. **Co-signer or joint application**: If you have a trusted friend or family member with good credit, consider asking them to co-sign or be a joint applicant on a car loan. This can increase your chances of getting approved for a loan and a decent interest rate.\n2. **Subprime lenders**: Companies like Capital One, Santander, and LendingPoint offer subprime car loans with more lenient credit requirements. Be prepared for higher interest rates and fees, though.\n3. **Used car dealerships**: Look for dealerships that cater to people with poor credit. They might have a wider range of options and more flexible financing terms. Be cautious of high-pressure sales tactics and make sure to read reviews before choosing a dealership.\n4. **Online lenders**: Companies like LendingTree, AutoCreditExpress, and DriveTime offer online car loan applications and may be more willing to work with people with poor credit.\n5. **Government programs**: If you're a veteran, student, or have a low income, you might be eligible for special financing programs or grants. Research government initiatives like the Department of Veterans Affairs' Auto Buying Program or the National Federation of Federal Employees' Car Buying Program.\n6. **Consider a longer loan term**: If you can't get approved for a shorter loan term, a longer loan might be an option. However, be aware that this can increase the total amount you pay over the life of the loan.\n7. **Save up for a down payment**: If you can, try to save up for a down payment. This can help reduce the amount you need to borrow and lower your monthly payments.\n8. **Negotiate and be prepared to walk away**: Don't be afraid to negotiate the price of the car and the interest rate. If you're not comfortable with the terms, be prepared to walk away from the deal.\n\nRemember to always read the fine print, ask plenty of questions, and prioritize your financial well-being.\n\nWhich of these options resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas you'd like to explore?"

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Maintaining a good conversation can be tough, especially if you're not used to it. First, let's break it down and identify the main reasons why people might struggle with this. Here are a few common issues:\n\n1. **Fear of saying something wrong**: You might be worried about saying something that'll make you sound stupid or offend the other person. This fear can lead to awkward silences or feeling like you're not contributing to the conversation.\n2. **Lack of common ground**: You might not know much about the topic or the person, making it hard to find something to talk about.\n3. **Social anxiety**: You might feel nervous or self-conscious in social situations, making it hard to relax and engage in conversation.\n4. **Lack of listening skills**: You might not be actively listening to the other person, which can lead to feeling like you're not sure what to say next.\n\nNow, here are some tips to help you improve your conversation skills:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When someone is talking, make an effort to really listen to what they're saying. Show you're engaged by nodding, making eye contact, and asking follow-up questions.\n2. **Find common ground**: Ask open-ended questions to learn more about the other person. This can help you find topics you both have in common and create a sense of connection.\n3. **Prepare ahead of time**: If you know you'll be in a situation where you'll need to have conversations, think about current events, popular books or movies, or common interests that you can use as conversation starters.\n4. **Be yourself**: It's okay to be a little awkward or unsure sometimes. People are more understanding than you think, and being genuine is often more attractive than trying to be someone you're not.\n5. **Start small**: Don't feel like you need to solve world hunger in one conversation. Start with simple, lighthearted topics and gradually move on to more substantial discussions.\n6. **Ask for help**: If you're really struggling, consider taking a course or workshop on communication or public speaking. These can help you build confidence and develop your skills.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to be the most charismatic person in the room. It's to be yourself, be respectful, and show genuine interest in the other person. With practice, you'll get more comfortable and confident in your ability to maintain good conversations."

I asked her if everything was okay and she said “Not really, he smashed my head against a tile wall and choked me a couple days ago and I want to know if he abused you too?” \n\nMy ex was a textbook narcissist (NO empathy, isolated me from family, abusive, used my family and me for money, aggressive, stalking, unfriendly to people, etc.) We dated for 3.5 years. It was complicated to leave for financial reasons, dogs together, and I was mentally torn completely down and just didn’t know how to ask for help. Honestly, I had no self esteem then. He told his new girlfriend that I just got up and left him out of the blue and caused him to have abandonment issues. What actually happened was I told him I was breaking up with him and I moved completely out the following day. It wasn’t random, I fought with him and tried leaving for at least a year. I broke up with him at the end of December 2019. \n\nSo, I met her at a restaurant to talk with her because I didn’t want anything to be typed out and I felt genuinely concerned for her. I’m a very empathetic person which is usually my weakness. My friend told me not to get involved, but I didn’t want this girl to feel alone like I did. I didn’t tell her what to do, but I shared my experience and just gave her advice from what I’ve learned. She showed me bruises from him on her arm and shared with me negative things that I also experienced.\n\nI’m not getting any more involved and just told her to be safe. We all live in the same area right now, unfortunately, but she said he might move away. She mentioned wanting to hang out sometime, but I don’t want to even consider that unless it’s later on and he is NOWHERE in the picture. They literally broke up this morning. It took me so long to finally get out of that relationship with him and I’ve never spoken or seen him since. She seemed like a very nice girl, though, and we had a lot in common since she grew up here too.\n\nWas it a bad move to talk to her or did I do the right thing to help her? Like I said, empathy is a weakness for me sometimes. I remember how hard it was for me to leave a narcissist. I ended up just losing my whole identity and support system in that relationship and I really don’t want her to experience that too. My friend thinks I was being too nice, but it felt like the right thing to do. I don’t have anything against this girl and have no attachment to my ex.\n\nTL;DR Ex’s new girlfriend wanted to talk to me and I don’t know if it was a good decision on my part.",

On one hand, you wanted to help her and show empathy, which is a kind and compassionate thing to do. On the other hand, your friend thinks you were being too nice, and you're worried about getting involved in your ex's life again.\n\nIn this situation, I think you did the right thing. You showed empathy and concern for someone who is going through a similar experience, and you shared your own story to help her understand what she's going through. By doing so, you're not only helping her but also potentially preventing her from making the same mistakes you did.\n\nIt's great that you're aware of your own weaknesses, including your empathy, and that you're taking steps to protect yourself from getting too involved. By setting boundaries and not wanting to hang out with her unless her ex is no longer in the picture, you're prioritizing your own well-being.\n\nRemember that you don't have to be friends with this girl or have a close relationship with her. You can still show empathy and support from a distance, and you can do so without sacrificing your own well-being.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that you've come a long way since your own experience with your ex. You've gained insight, self-awareness, and a stronger sense of self. You're in a better position to help others now, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. If you feel like you're getting too involved or feeling overwhelmed, it's okay to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. Remember to take care of yourself and prioritize your own healing and growth."

    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It can be frustrating to feel like you're stuck in a cycle of friendly acquaintanceships that don't quite translate to deeper connections.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of focusing on trying to \"move past\" the shallow interactions, try to identify what's actually holding you back from taking the next step. Is it:\n\n1. Lack of common ground or shared interests?\n2. Fear of rejection or feeling like you're imposing on someone's time?\n3. Not knowing how to initiate meaningful conversations or activities?\n4. Something else entirely?\n\nOnce you pinpoint the barrier, you can start working on addressing it. For example, if it's lack of common ground, you could ask more open-ended questions to find out what the other person is passionate about. If it's fear of rejection, remind yourself that it's okay to take small risks and that the worst that can happen is they say no.\n\nAnother strategy is to look for opportunities to \"triangulate\" with someone – that is, find a mutual friend or shared interest that can help facilitate a deeper connection. For instance, if you have a friend who's also close with the person you're trying to get closer to, you could ask your mutual friend to introduce you or set up a group outing.\n\nLastly, be patient and don't be too hard on yourself. Building strong bonds takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on showing up consistently, being genuine, and being willing to put in the effort, and the rest will follow.\n\nWhat do you think might be holding you back, and how do you think you can start addressing it?"

There were many things about their relationship that were challenging for me and the rest of our friends—their obsession with each other, the time they spent together to the exclusion of all others in their life, their need to constantly be touching when we were out in public together. However, we’ve all mostly gotten over it and are genuinely happy for them.\nBut now my other friend just saw Jared on a dating app. This friend is male and the dating app is meant for guys only. I know for a fact that Rue and Jared don’t have an open relationship. In fact, Jared is super religious and has only ever dated women. Rue and Jared are planning to not have sex until marriage.\nShould I say something to Rue? I know she’d be devastated to hear Jared is on a dating app. At the same time, what if he was just on there as a joke, or what if someone else is impersonating him and he’s not actually looking for male partners? I feel sick with guilt over keeping this secret, as Rue tells me they are quickly moving toward engagement. What should I do?",
    "human": "One of my go-to rules in this sort of situation is to assess whether you have direct evidence that you can report to your friend. Since you didn’t see Jared’s account yourself, I think your best move—if any—is to encourage your other friend to speak to Rue. As you say, there’s a slim-but-real chance that it wasn’t Jared (although I’m not really sure what the “joke” would be if it were a joke, beyond the straightforwardly homophobic “Wouldn’t it be funny if I were gay?”), and since you didn’t see his profile yourself or have any sort of dating-app interaction with him, you wouldn’t be able to clarify or answer follow-up questions should Rue have any.\nIf anything, I think you have grounds to try to talk to her about the fact that you miss spending time one on one, instead of avoiding talking about the things that have bothered you in the past year in favor of “A friend of mine saw Jared on Scruff, so you should probably ask him about it.”",

Are you telling Rue because you genuinely care about her well-being, or is it because you're worried about being seen as complicit in keeping a secret? Be honest with yourself.\n\nSince you're unsure about Jared's intentions, it might be wise to gather more information before approaching Rue. You could try to subtly ask your friend who saw Jared on the app if they have any evidence or if they're certain it's really Jared. If your friend is hesitant or unsure, it might be better to wait until you have more concrete proof.\n\nIf you do decide to tell Rue, be prepared for a potentially devastating conversation. Approach her with empathy and compassion, and avoid making accusatory statements. You could say something like, \"Hey Rue, I need to talk to you about something that's been bothering me. I overheard [friend's name] mention seeing Jared on a dating app. I know this might be a sensitive topic, but I want to support you and be honest with you. Can we talk about this?\"\n\nRemember that Rue might not take it well, especially given their strong commitment to their relationship. Be prepared for her to be angry, hurt, or defensive. Your goal should be to support her, not to judge her or Jared.\n\nLastly, consider the possibility that Rue might already know about Jared's infidelity or might have a good reason for not wanting to confront the issue. It's essential to approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to her perspective.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but prioritize being honest and empathetic in your approach."

Choose a setting where you're both comfortable and can have a brief, casual conversation.\n2. **Find a conversation starter**: Prepare a simple, light-hearted question or comment that shows you're interested in getting to know them better.

This will help them feel more comfortable and encourage them to open up.\n5. **Keep it brief (at first)**: Don't try to tackle too much in one conversation. Start with a simple question or topic and see where it takes you. You can always follow up later with more questions or topics.\n6. **Be patient and flexible**: It's okay if the conversation doesn't flow immediately. Don't stress if it feels awkward at first. Just relax, and remember that it's normal to take a little time to build momentum.\n\nSome additional tips to avoid awkwardness:\n\n* Avoid interrupting or dominating the conversation\n* Show genuine interest and curiosity\n* Don't overthink it – just be yourself\n* Keep the conversation light and casual\n* Be open to learning about them, and don't be afraid to share about yourself\n\nRemember, the goal is to start a conversation, not to become best friends overnight. By being genuine, respectful, and interested, you can break the ice and start building a connection with this person. Good luck!"

    "sentence": "Not to make this overly long and detailed, but I've been with my partner for almost 1.5 years. He's the first healthy, long-term commitment after years of avoiding commitments.\n\nThing is, I know this is irrational but once I found myself in a secure relationship, my old body image insecurities came back and hit me like a ton of bricks. It took many years but I did grow to appreciate my appearance, and to be confident in my body and my sexuality, and now I feel like all that work has crumbled or that maybe I deluded myself into false self-love.\n\nThe fact that I know he's slept with/dated hotter women (I essentially asked him to confirm this) has reignited those old insecurities. I am surprised by how much this has triggered my anxiety, I haven't obsessively compared myself to other women like this for years, and this feels self-destructive especially given it's to faceless beauties or women I've never met.\n\nThis culminated in a serious anxiety spiral triggered when I inadvertently saw a text from his friend referencing the greatest night of sex he'd had with the hottest woman he'd ever fucked. Between us, I have the higher libido, but when I saw that text about him having multiple rounds of sex with this girl from 5 years ago, I irrationally spiralled. (Unfortunately) the conversation led to him confirming that this was an exception because she was THAT attractive, not something I could achieve how I am. \n\nSadly, I have been unable to forget this sense of sexual inadequacy I've gotten since. Didn't help when I learnt he had a photo of this girl still on his phone, a relic from before we met that he hadn't remembered he'd kept until that incident. \n\nI don't know how to regain my confidence again, this feels like I've released something I barely managed to overcome the first time. It's starting to impact our relationship, I can't help but see flashes of this mystery girl and him when he touches me which makes me turn in shame.This is irrational because I know he loves me and finds me attractive.\n\nTL;DR: I learnt from my partner's friend about my partner's best night of sex with the hottest girl he'd ever met. Unfortunately led to his explaining that was a one off because she was THAT unbelievably hot, and my learning a photo of her was still in his phone. It's re-triggered some old irrational insecurities about my body and new ones about my sexual performance.\n\nIs there a way I can get past this irrational shame before it detrimentally impacts my relationship? Any advice for dealing with old insecurities in healthy relationships, or with comparing myself to his past? I don't want to and shouldn't put down women I have never met.\n\nEdit: sorry, just to clarify, I am and have been in therapy for some years and do have diagnosed anxiety. I recognise how irrational, and thus self-harmful, my own actions and my own insecurities have been. I do plan to discuss this with my therapist when I see her soon. I appreciate the advice of professional help, and would always advocate for therapy. I guess I'm just shocked by how much this affects me in this healthy commitment, when it wasn't an issue in my last relationship. I guess I was wondering if anybody has advice to help with what feels like self-sabotage, but I know it has to start and end with me.",
    "human": "&gt;(Unfortunately) the conversation led to him confirming that this was an exception because she was THAT attractive, not something I could achieve how I am. \n\nHow did this exchange go? It SEEMS like this is your perception of it which is coloured strongly by your own filter. What were the actual words said?",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with this. It's completely understandable, given the circumstances. First, let me acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share this with someone, and I'm here to offer support and guidance.\n\nIt's not uncommon for old insecurities to resurface when we're in a new relationship, especially if it's a healthy and committed one. It's as if our minds are testing the waters, making sure we're not settling or compromising our standards. In your case, it's clear that this incident has triggered a lot of emotions and self-doubt.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you regain your confidence and move forward:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and accept your feelings**: It's essential to recognize that these feelings are valid, even if they're irrational. Don't beat yourself up over them or try to suppress them. Instead, acknowledge the emotions and accept that they're a natural response to the situation.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, just as you would to a friend in a similar situation. Remind yourself that you're not alone, and that it's okay to feel this way. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or journaling to help you cultivate self-compassion.\n3. **Reframe the situation**: Try to reframe the conversation with your partner in a more positive light. Instead of focusing on the other woman's physical appearance, focus on your partner's appreciation for your unique qualities and the reasons why they chose you. Remember that everyone has their own preferences, and it's not a competition.\n4. **Communicate with your partner**: Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling. Let them know that you're struggling with these insecurities and that you need their support and reassurance. They may not even realize the impact their words had on you, and a conversation can help clear the air.\n5. **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of dwelling on what you can't control (your partner's past or other women's physical appearance), focus on what you can control – your own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Practice self-care, engage in activities that make you feel good, and work on building your self-esteem.\n6. **Work on building your self-acceptance**: This might be a good opportunity to revisit your self-acceptance work. Remember that you're more than your physical appearance, and that your worth and value come from who you are as a person. Practice affirmations, work on building your self-esteem, and focus on your strengths and accomplishments.\n7. **Discuss with your therapist**: As you mentioned, it's essential to discuss this with your therapist. They can help you work through these feelings, identify any underlying issues, and develop coping strategies to manage your anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time to process these emotions, and it's normal to feel like you're taking a step backward. But with self-compassion, communication, and support, you can work through this and regain your confidence."

First of all, I would like to say thank you for all the kind words and genuine advice, though it was all things I had heard before, it made a massive difference hearing it from strangers who don't even know me. All of that and my friends giving me some tough but much needed love, I finally got the courage to talk to my husband.  \n\nNot long after I posted my original post my husband called me to tell me he had ended up *LOSING* the job he abandoned me for. He doesn't have a good track record with work (Just in general has been seen as \"lazy\" ect.) so this wasn't shocking but was a *COMPLETE* slap in the face. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I felt let down *again*. As soon as he lost the job, he immediately started talking about how he was going to move in with me, I became sick to my stomach because *I DID NOT* want him here. I felt and still feel like a fall-back option. I wasn't his priority in the first place but now that he is down on his luck, it's just \"easier\" for him to move here and start over with my help. I told him to not look at jobs here right away and look where he is, and he somewhat agreed.\n\n After about a week of us not talking he messaged me out of nowhere telling me that he had found a job in my area that \"Was a great opportunity\", he used the same wording he had used with the job he had just lost. I was talking with a friend when he sent the message, she told me point blank 'Talk to him now, or he is going to show up on your doorstep and you are going to be stuck in this situation for another few years, and you promised yourself you would talk to him this week.\" She was 100% right, so I went and talked to him. \n\nI told him everything, how I felt, how I am feeling, how heartbroken I am, how his issues and his treatment of me have pushed me over the edge. He realized that a lot of what I said was things I had already brought up, he did own up to somethings, yet not everything. I had given him a million chances during the conversation to tell me the things I should improve on because I am well aware I am not blameless. I should have talked to him more etc. The only thing he could think of was the fact that I don't incite/participate in sex with him. I brought up my issues with sex and my insecurities, he said he understood but I don't think he understood how much it affected me (from my past trauma and other bad experiences), and how he never made me feel better. I then brought up how I hate how much porn he watches (side note: I don't hate porn, I just think excessive use can be bad), and how it gave him an unrealistic expectation of sex, he said, \"I feel like I have to watch it to get turned on to have sex with you\", that comment made my stomach drop, and my already low self-confidence deep dive even lower. Also, I knew this was a complete lie, as he NEVER initiated sex after watching porn- not once. I knew right then I was ***done***. How could I even consider repairing this when he feels like he needs to watch other people to get turned on enough to have sex with me?! Mind you, he would casually watch porn without jerking off or anything, this man always had porn open like a Spotify playlist. \n\nHe is trying *DESPERATELY* to keep me, messaging me constantly how much he loves me, making YouTube playlists of songs, sending me flowers etc. but it's all too little, too late in my eyes. He's also downplaying the situation to his closest friends and family, just chalking it up to me being upset with him. All of this just makes me more upset, anxious, on edge, and quite frankly mad.\n\n I already started filling out paperwork to file for divorce when I am 100% ready and will be asking him to stop texting me as much (particularly all the lovey dovey out of character stuff) and sending me things this week.  This whole thing has been a lot, but I am grateful for everyone who took the time to send me words of encouragement. I have realized, and am continuing to realize, my self-worth and I know I am worth so much more than a man who never tried in our whole 8 years of a relationship up until now. There's more I could get into, but I think I'll leave it here. Thank you all again for all your kind words and advice. Feel free to comment on the original post if you’d like to say anything, or would like to give words of wisdom or advice.\n\nTL:DR: I finally talked to my husband about everything and will be leaving him soon.

It's not an easy decision, but it sounds like it's what's best for you.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was his comment about needing to watch porn to get turned on to have sex with you. That's a huge red flag, and it's not okay for him to make you feel like you're not enough for him. It's clear that he has some deep-seated issues and is not willing to work on them.\n\nRemember that you deserve so much better than someone who is willing to settle for a relationship that's so clearly lacking in intimacy and emotional connection. You deserve someone who is willing to work on themselves and prioritize your needs.\n\nI'm so proud of you for taking control of your life and making decisions that align with your values and priorities. You got this, and you deserve all the happiness and fulfillment that comes with being in a healthy, loving relationship."

That's the first step!\n\nNow, let's break it down. It's not about being perfect or achieving immediate results, but rather building habits and momentum. Here's a suggestion:\n\nInstead of focusing on the end goal, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, instead of \"gain muscle,\" try \"do 10 push-ups every morning\" or \"cook a healthy meal for dinner tonight.\" Make them ridiculously simple and achievable.\n\nAlso, instead of using timers or withholding comforts, try incorporating positive reinforcement. Reward yourself for small wins, like taking a relaxing bath or reading a chapter in a book after completing a task. This can help create a sense of accomplishment and motivation.\n\nAnother thing that might help is to identify the underlying reasons behind your lack of motivation. Is it fear of failure, perfectionism, or something else? Acknowledge those feelings and work on addressing them.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to have off days and it's not a failure if you don't meet your goals. Life is unpredictable, and it's normal to have ups and downs. The key is to learn to adapt and adjust.\n\nLastly, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. You're not alone in this struggle, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Take small steps, celebrate small wins, and be patient with yourself.\n\nHow does that sound?"

Combating judgmental thinking requires self-awareness, empathy, and intentional practice.

Label it as \"judgment\" and gently let it go. This helps you become more aware of your thoughts and can help you detach from them.\n2. **Empathy training**: Put yourself in others' shoes and try to understand their perspective. Ask yourself, \"How would I feel if I were in their situation?\" or \"What might be driving their behavior?\" This helps you develop compassion and understanding.\n3. **Challenge your assumptions**: When you notice yourself judging someone, ask yourself, \"What's my evidence for this judgment?\" or \"Is this assumption true?\" Be willing to reframe your thoughts and consider alternative perspectives.\n4. **Practice gratitude**: Focus on the good qualities and strengths of others. Express appreciation and acknowledge the positive aspects of people's actions or behaviors. This helps shift your attention away from judgment and fosters a more positive attitude.\n5. **Self-reflection**: Identify the underlying reasons for your judgments. Are you feeling insecure, anxious, or threatened? Are you projecting your own fears or biases onto others? Addressing these underlying issues can help reduce judgmental thinking.\n6. **Develop a growth mindset**: Recognize that everyone is a work in progress, including yourself. Treat others with kindness and understanding, just as you would want them to treat you.\n7. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with others, focus on understanding their words, tone, and emotions. Avoid interrupting or mentally preparing your response while they're speaking. This helps you stay present and avoid jumping to conclusions.\n8. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and avoid those who fuel negative or critical thinking.\n9. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding when you slip up and catch yourself judging. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to make mistakes.\n10. **Cultivate a sense of curiosity**: Approach people and situations with an open mind, curious about their experiences and perspectives. This helps you stay engaged and focused on understanding, rather than judging.\n\nRemember, it takes time and effort to change ingrained habits. Be patient and consistent in your practice, and you'll see progress over time. With time and dedication, you can minimize and eventually eradicate judgmental thinking, replacing it with a more compassionate and understanding mindset."

However I can no longer ignore the fact that he has changed in a way I find negative and sometimes he makes me cringe hard.\n\nBasically he had a change that's been slowly ongoing for years, he got really into a specific scene/community that I do not like or understand but I was willing to just ignore it because you don't necessarily need to share everything. It has become harder to ignore though since it seems to be pretty much overtaking his life. Nowadays IMO we have a huge maturity gap between us, which to some degree was always there, but it's like he has become even more immature and childlike. We are in different stages in life and it gets a bit tiring. And recently he invited me to something together with a few of his friends that he knows from that community, and I found them all pretty weird (but I was friendly and polite the whole evening to them) and my friend acted in a different way around them than he does when its just us 2, and it was just a very strange offputting behaviour to me. I am pretty sure that if I met him nowadays as a 'new' person and he acted like that I would not even consider being friends with him. I had always hoped that maybe his obsession with that community and the immaturity was a phase that would eventually end but we're closing in on 30 and he's still like that and I really don't think its normal anymore. But on the other hand I feel some kind of loyalty towards him and memory of the fun times we've had. I also don't wanna be overly judgy as long as it doesn't concern me but like I said it's become hard to ignore because he is so open about it and its clearly his biggest priority.\n\nI've already decided I have no interest in meeting with him again if any of the other friends that I don't like are around as well. If its just us 2 then I think it can be fine. But even then, sometimes he says stuff that makes me cringe or talks about stuff from his community when were in public and I just feel embarassed in the moment. He also sometimes, but not always, neglects his hygiene and it can be a little gross.\n\nIdk, I just wonder what to do with this friendship since I don't really feel the want to cut contact or anything but he shows behaviour that really weirds me out. I feel like I still haven't fully registered that he's not the same person as 8 years ago anymore. He's also made comments in the past indicating he's perhaps noticed that I've been a bit more distant. \n\n---\n\n**tl;dr**: I feel loyalty towards my friend of 8 years but he has changed and often makes me cringe nowadays.

It's not about being judgmental; it's about being honest with yourself about your feelings.\n\nGiven your concerns, it's wise to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Since you've already decided to avoid social gatherings with his community friends, that's a good start. If it's just the two of you, you can still maintain the friendship, but with some adjustments.\n\nConsider having an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling. Approach the conversation with empathy and avoid being accusatory or critical. Express your concerns and feelings in a non-judgmental way, focusing on your own experiences and emotions. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about us. I've noticed that you've changed in ways that make me feel uncomfortable, and I'm struggling to connect with you as much as I used to. I value our friendship, but I need some space and clarity on what's important to you. I feel like we're growing apart, and I'm not sure how to bridge the gap.\"\n\nThis conversation might help your friend understand your perspective and potentially spark a deeper discussion about his priorities and values. Be prepared for a range of reactions, from defensiveness to introspection.\n\nIf the conversation doesn't lead to a significant shift or improvement, it may be time to reevaluate the friendship and consider distancing yourself or setting clear boundaries. Remember that you can't control your friend's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it.\n\nLastly, acknowledge that you've grown and changed as well, and it's natural for friendships to evolve over time. It's okay to acknowledge that this friendship may not be sustainable in its current form. Prioritize self-care and focus on nurturing relationships that uplift and support you.\n\nRemember, loyalty doesn't mean sacrificing your own well-being."

Some banks might have lower or no fees for certain currencies or cards.\n2. **Use an ATM**: Withdrawal fees from your bank's ATM network are often lower than currency exchange offices or airports. Look for ATMs affiliated with your bank's network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, or Plus) to avoid extra fees. You can also use an ATM locator app like Allpoint or Global ATM Alliance to find participating ATMs.\n3. **Exchange rates**: Compare exchange rates among banks, currency exchange offices, and ATMs to find the best deal. You can use online tools like XE.com or Oanda.com to check rates. For Canada, you can also check the Bank of Canada's website for exchange rates.\n4. **Convert at your bank**: If you need a larger amount, consider converting some cash at your bank before leaving. They might have better exchange rates than airport exchange offices. However, be aware that they might charge a fee for the service.\n5. **Airport exchange offices**: If you prefer to exchange cash at the airport, look for authorized currency exchange offices like Travelex or Western Union. They often have competitive rates, but be prepared for higher fees and less favorable exchange rates.\n6. **Cash withdrawal limits**: Check with your bank to see if they have daily withdrawal limits for international transactions. You might need to notify them of your travel plans to avoid any issues.\n7. **Korean Won**: Since you'll be traveling to Korea, you might want to exchange some cash for Won upon arrival. Many currency exchange offices at airports or major train stations in Korea have competitive rates.\n\nFor your specific situation:\n\n* For Japan, you can exchange some cash at your bank before leaving, as you mentioned. You can also withdraw Japanese Yen (JPY) from an ATM at the airport or in major cities.\n* For Korea, consider exchanging some cash for Won (KRW) upon arrival, as mentioned earlier. You can also withdraw Won from an ATM using your Canadian debit or credit card.\n\nTips:\n\n* Always keep some local currency (JPY and KRW) for small purchases and transportation, especially at the beginning of your trip.\n* Avoid exchanging large amounts of cash at airports, as rates might be less favorable.\n* Keep your receipts and records of currency exchanges, as you might need to declare the cash when returning to Canada.\n* Inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with your account or transactions.\n\nI hope this helps you navigate the cash conversion process. Safe travels, and enjoy your trip to Japan and Korea!"

    "sentence": "To the people in corporate who stammer, how do you handle calls I am 26 years old who has stuttered for as long as I can remember. I find it extremely difficult to run calls and I am ashamed of my stammer, I am looking for advice on how I can fix it or make it better.\n\nI was bullied a lot in school for my stutter and I feel my colleagues not saying anything just makes me scared that I’ll be fired. I work 2x or 3x harder than my peers but I  am unable to back it up in calls. I’m extremely ashamed of myself and I feel my life is never going to get better\n\nPlease help",
    "human": "Great question! How to keep from stammering? For me I work on tonality and repetition! Put your finger in your ear when no one is Home! Join public speaking groups such as toastmasters! Practice makes better and don't beat yourself up! Also, when you are brave enough listen to a 3 good, 2 bad and one ugly call!",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're struggling with feelings of shame and inadequacy due to your stutter. It's not just the stutter itself, but also the fear of being judged and rejected by others.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people stutter, and it's not a reflection of your intelligence, competence, or worth as a person. It's essential to reframe your mindset and focus on your strengths and abilities.\n\nRegarding your calls, I want to emphasize that it's not about \"fixing\" or \"improving\" your stutter. Instead, it's about finding ways to manage your anxiety and build confidence. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Practice relaxation techniques: Before calls, try deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization to calm your nerves. You can find many resources online or work with a therapist to develop a personalized relaxation routine.\n2. Prepare, prepare, prepare: Make sure you're well-prepared for calls by researching the topic, practicing your responses, and having a clear understanding of the agenda. This will help you feel more confident and in control.\n3. Focus on the content, not the stutter: Instead of worrying about how you're speaking, focus on the conversation itself. Concentrate on the topic, the other person's perspective, and the value you're bringing to the conversation.\n4. Find a supportive environment: Share your concerns with a trusted colleague or mentor who can offer guidance and encouragement. They may be able to provide valuable insights or suggest accommodations to help you feel more comfortable during calls.\n5. Consider accommodations: If you're struggling to communicate effectively, consider requesting accommodations such as a note-taker, a communication assistant, or a modified call format. Your employer may be willing to work with you to find solutions that meet your needs.\n\nRegarding your fear of being judged or fired, I want to assure you that it's not a realistic concern. Employers are obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, including stuttering. If you're concerned about stigma, consider having an open and honest conversation with your HR department or supervisor about your needs and any accommodations you may require.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not defined by your stutter. You're a capable, talented, and valuable individual with so much to offer. Don't let your stutter hold you back from pursuing your goals and aspirations.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to face this alone."

    "sentence": "I (22F) met a really great guy (25M) on a dating app in December. We instantly clicked and I had a great time with him and saw him again the next week. We both admitted we liked eachother a lot and that we were feeling very strongly about one another right away. It was both our first times meeting someone we really liked in a while. And I haven’t been in a relationship for 3 years, and he hasn’t in 7 years. Both high school relationships that didn’t end well. After that on Boxing Day I went to Cuba for a week w family and we texted constantly really lovey dovey and I honestly couldn’t wait to get back and see him! We both said how much we missed eachother. \n\nI came back and we slept together for the 1st time and it was amazing. I didn’t feel pressured or rushed which was great. He would talk to me about the future, like going places together, potentially living together, how he was crazy about me and could see himself falling in love. Everything was great, I saw him once sometimes twice a week and when I didn’t see him we would message eachother a couple times through the day which was nice :) then…\n\n A few weeks later, near the end of January I could tell something was up. He was txting me a bit less and he told me that he wants to slow things down because he was getting a bit scared and it was moving fast. I must’ve used the word boyfriend or girlfriend and I guess it made him realize it was moving fast. I was upset but agreed cuz I really like him and want it to work. After that though he texted me way less and I was normally the one initiating plans. And when we hung out it was still amazing but I’d get a little sad thinking that I wouldn’t hear from him for who knows how long unless it was asking to hangout or me asking. \n\nThe last time I saw him was last weekend, and during that week he didn’t txt me once. I normally initiate the texting even if it’s a small “hope you have a great day :)” so I didn’t and I heard nothing from him. Finally I caved and asked to see him on the weekend &amp; when I saw him I asked if I would have heard from him at all if not for me texting him. And he said no cuz he’s busy during the week and had plans on the weekend. I asked why he never txts me and he said he’s really busy with work which is true, he doesn’t like texting or social media which is also true. and he said it felt like I was interrogating him and he got defensive / annoyed Since then I’ve been debating ending things because that hurt. \n\nI called him today and told him I’m not sure we should continue if he reacted that way over a small issue. He apologized and said when he heard it coming from my mouth he realized how hurtful what he said was. We had a long talk and he was honest and said what he’s giving me is all he can give right now and he’d still like to see me but right now this is all it can be. We also live far, like 45min to 1 hr and I normally take a train to see him so we can’t really just meet up whenever. He said it’d be different if we live close and could hangout anytime but it’s not the case :( \n\nSo Reddit I turn to you for advice. Based on what I’ve said should I end it or stick around and be hopeful that it will turn into something more one day? I wasnt ready or wanting a relationship until I met him. I’ve never liked someone so much, we are crazy similar and have the same sense of humor I’ve never felt so comfortable around someone :( &amp; he really makes me feel so special and beautiful. I don’t want to regret ending it and make a huge mistake. I also live at home and don’t enjoy being there &amp; I get lonely so I like going out to see him. What do you think?\n\nTl:dr - guy I really like doesn’t text me unless it’s to hangout, don’t know if I should keep seeing him and hope for a relationship one day or end it.",
    "human": "End it. He sounds like a basket case. I know it's hard in situations like this because you have all these feel-good chemicals floating through your system convincing you he's this amazing guy, but please please please save yourself the emotional turmoil and just end it.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so glad you're seeking advice from Reddit!\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and consider the pros and cons of the situation. It's clear that you have strong feelings for this guy, and it's natural to want to hold onto that.\n\nHowever, it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries. The fact that he didn't initiate contact for a week, and then got defensive when you asked him about it, is concerning. It's not okay to make someone feel like they're interrogating you, especially when you're in a budding relationship.\n\nConsidering the distance and the lack of effort he's putting into the relationship, it might be worth reevaluating whether this is the kind of relationship you want to be in. You deserve someone who is willing to put in the effort to communicate with you regularly, even if it's just a simple \"hello\" or \"how was your day?\".\n\nIt's also important to consider that he's giving you \"all he can give right now,\" which is a red flag. Relationships are about compromise and mutual effort, not one person giving and the other taking. If he's not willing to put in the work to make the relationship more substantial, it might be a sign that he's not invested in making it work long-term.\n\nI'm not saying you should end it immediately, but I do think it's worth having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. You've already expressed your feelings and concerns, and it's time for him to step up and show you that he's committed to making this work.\n\nIf he's not willing to make changes and meet you halfway, it might be time to reevaluate whether this is the right relationship for you. You deserve someone who is willing to work with you to build a strong connection.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this decision. Take your time, and trust your instincts. If you're feeling uncertain, it might be helpful to take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. You deserve someone who will prioritize your feelings and well-being."

However, it's essential to approach this with sensitivity and tact.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Check with the groom**: Before deciding to give a speech, have an open and honest conversation with the groom. Let him know how you feel and ask if he'd be comfortable with you speaking. This will help you gauge his feelings and avoid any potential awkwardness.\n2. **Keep it brief and respectful**: Since you mentioned you want to keep it short and sweet, aim for a 2-3 minute speech at most.

Avoid making it all about your own experiences or feelings. Instead, focus on celebrating the groom and his relationship with his partner.\n4. **Be genuine and authentic**: Speak from the heart, and be sincere in your words. Share a funny anecdote or two, but also make sure your speech is respectful and considerate of the occasion.\n\nIf you do decide to give a speech, I'm sure your friend will appreciate the effort you put into it.

Now, let's work on some strategies to help you manage those nerves.\n\nSince imagining everyone naked doesn't work for you, let's try something else. Have you considered focusing on your own internal experience instead of the audience's? Instead of worrying about what others think, bring your attention to your own breath, your physical sensations, or a calming phrase. You can even silently repeat a mantra to yourself, like \"I've got this\" or \"I'm prepared.\"\n\nAnother approach is to reframe your thinking. Instead of thinking \"I'm going to make a fool of myself,\" try reframing it to \"I'm sharing my thoughts and ideas with others, and that's okay.\" Remember that everyone else is probably just as nervous as you are, but they're not showing it.\n\nLastly, practice, practice, practice! The more you put yourself in situations where you have to speak up, the more comfortable you'll become. It's like building up your mental muscles – the more you exercise, the stronger you get.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to talk to your professor or a trusted friend about your anxiety.

The prices are way expensive (overpriced) compared to the market price, and I was very passive and signed up anyway because I didn't wanna miss out on the opportunity. I could have argued with her that her prices are too expensive for students, but I kept my mouth shut (not that my argument would change her mind, all I wanted was to speak up my mind). \n\nHow can I have confidence in myself? and my abilities to convince others?",
    "human": "I think a lot of it boils down to knowing whether you're right or wrong. If someone's been an asshole to you, first of all, do you care about this person?

They're a nobody, I save my time for my family and friends. Someone that's enough of a loser to yell something at a stranger on the street isn't enough to be part of my life. I know that sounds arrogant, but someone has to filter out the shit people from the good ones, and no one can do it for you.\n\nIf it's someone you need to get along with like a relative or coworker, just civilly bring up whatever it is and ask them about it. Just be like \"That thing earlier, what was that? Were you just having a bad day or something?\" That'll let them know you're paying attention to how they're treating you and you're calling them on their shit. If the person is an overt dickhead who wouldn't respond well to something like that, point out their insecurity. Reduce their power. Cut to the heart of it. Just be like \"Aww, are you showing off to your friends?\" then carry on doing what you're doing. Because at the heart of every asshole, there's insecurity, always, and they don't like being called out on it. Just be as condescending as possible and treat them like a kid. They're being an asshole for ego and having the room hearing them get patronised will make them stop.\n\nWith regards to negotiating, etc., I know this sounds simple but, don't worry about it. Just don't, you're not being rude. Business owners have to deal with all kinds of people FAR less courteous than yourself, and if their product/service is as good as they say it is, they'll be happy to tell you how much it is and why it's that.

Instead of trying to tackle a big, intimidating situation like negotiating with the fitness club owner, try practicing assertive communication in smaller, low-stakes interactions. For instance:\n\n1. Ask a friend or family member to role-play a scenario with you. Practice asserting your needs or opinions in a calm, respectful manner. This will help you get comfortable with speaking up and feeling heard.\n2. Start small in everyday conversations. For example, if someone cuts you off in line or takes your parking spot, calmly but firmly express your concerns. You might say something like, \"Excuse me, I was here first. Could I please have the spot back?\" or \"I was next in line. Could you please let me go ahead?\"\n3. Practice mindfulness and self-compassion. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel nervous or uncertain. Acknowledge those feelings, take a deep breath, and focus on your values and goals. You got this!\n\nWhen it comes to the fitness club, here's what you could do:\n\n1. Take a deep breath and approach the owner calmly. You could say something like, \"Hi [Owner's Name], I really appreciate the opportunity to join your club, but I have to be honest with you – the prices are a bit steep for me as a student. Would you be open to discussing possible discounts or alternatives?\"\n2. Remember that it's okay if the owner says no. You're not trying to \"win\" or prove a point; you're simply expressing your concerns and being honest. If they're not willing to budge, you can still decide if it's worth it for you to join or not.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that confidence comes from within. It's not about convincing others; it's about being true to yourself and your values. When you prioritize your own needs and well-being, you'll feel more confident and empowered to speak up.\n\nYou got this, friend!

I've been able to get in contact with someone who can prescribe meds - again, this provider has a loose affiliation w/my university and is quite cheap (not free tho). \n\nThe big question - how can I hide meds? I've put forth a few ideas below and my thoughts about them, but I'd like to see if y'all can come up with something better, please 🥺\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\n* rent a locker at university, and put meds in there. \n   * Pros - very safe, I have access to the only key and I can just take 'em as needed. \n   * Cons - Idk what I'll do during summer/winter/spring/thanksgiving break.\n* leave my meds in an obscure (indoor) spot @ the campus\n   * Pros - if it's obscure enough, only I will know where that spot is. Don't need to splurge for a locker. \n   * Cons - Might be illegal since someone might find it / eat it (it's a controlled substance probably)? Might get stolen. I might forget where said spot it. It might be thrown away by cleaning staff. bad idea probably. \n* put the meds in my backpack.\n   * Pros - I don't need to worry about timing. I have it with me all the time. \n   * Cons - My mom always thinks my backpack is too heavy for my back and wants to see what's in it. Usually it's just a laptop/ipad/charger stuff but if they see the meds I'm toast. Also, the meds might make a \"clinking\" sound as I walk which will definitely give them away.\n* Hide it in another medication bottle at home.\n   * Pros - I have it with me all the time. My parents aren't *looking* for it / aren't suspicious of anything so it might just skip their notice. \n   * Cons - I read about this in a TIFU post so it might not be a good idea lol (OP there had their parent accidentally take too much ADHD meds instead of zinc or whatever). \n\nAs y'all can see, my ideas seem to get progressively worse, so any help would be appreciated, tysm!",

    "human": "A couple of things that come to mind:\n* Wear a fairly thick rubber band on your wrist; every time you catch yourself saying it, snap the rubber band.\n* If your friends also curse a lot, start holding each other accountable; if they don't have them start yelling at you every time you cuss.\n\nDo Not use substitute words (ex: frack, frick, etc) - you're just trading one crutch for another. \n\nGood luck!",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're acknowledging the issue and wanting to make a change! It's great that you're aware of how your language is impacting your life, especially in your relationships.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that using curse words is often a habit that's deeply ingrained in our language patterns. It's not something that you're doing on purpose, but it's become a reflex for you. So, instead of beating yourself up over it, let's focus on developing a strategy to help you break this habit.\n\nHere's a suggestion: become more mindful of your language. When you catch yourself about to use a curse word, pause for a second, take a deep breath, and substitute it with a more neutral phrase. It might feel awkward at first, but it's a great way to become more aware of your language.\n\nAnother approach is to replace curse words with alternative expressions that still convey your emotions effectively. For example, instead of saying \"Oh, for F's sake!\", you could say \"Oh, goodness gracious!\" or \"Good grief!\" These phrases still convey frustration or surprise, but in a more constructive way.\n\nAdditionally, try to identify the emotions that are driving your use of curse words. Are you stressed, frustrated, or angry? Once you're aware of your emotions, you can work on finding healthier ways to cope with them. Maybe you need to take a break, go for a walk, or practice some deep breathing exercises.\n\nLastly, surround yourself with people who support you in your efforts to change. Share your struggles with a trusted friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. Having a support system can make a significant difference in your progress.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and effort, but it's worth it. You're already taking the first step by acknowledging the issue and wanting to change. Keep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up – just acknowledge the setback and keep moving forward.\n\nLastly, I want to reassure you that being single doesn't define your worth as a person. You are more than your relationships, and you deserve to be happy and fulfilled regardless of your romantic status. Focus on building a fulfilling life, and the right relationships will follow.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to add?"

It's better to be upfront and clear about your past relationships rather than leaving room for misunderstandings or assumptions.\n2. Avoid awkwardness: Not mentioning your ex or downplaying the relationship can lead to awkwardness and potentially even jealousy or insecurity on your current partner's part. By being open and honest, you can diffuse any potential tension and show that you're committed to your current relationship.\n3. Set a good example: As a responsible and considerate partner, you want to set a good example for your current partner. Introducing your ex as your ex demonstrates that you're willing to be open and honest about your past, which can help build trust and strengthen your current relationship.\n\nOf course, there may be situations where it's better to not mention your ex at all, such as if it's a casual, one-off encounter.

Here are some tips to help you navigate and potentially extinguish narcissistic behavior:\n\n1. **Set clear boundaries**: Establishing healthy boundaries is crucial when dealing with narcissists. Be direct, firm, and assertive in communicating your needs and expectations. Make it clear what you're comfortable with and what you're not.\n2. **Don't feed their ego**: Avoid giving excessive praise or attention to narcissists, as this can fuel their self-absorption. Instead, focus on having genuine conversations and show interest in others.\n3. **Don't take it personally**: Remember that narcissistic behavior is often a defense mechanism or a coping mechanism. Try not to internalize their words or actions as a personal attack. Keep in mind that their behavior is not about you, but about their own insecurities.\n4. **Practice active listening**: When engaging with narcissists, listen attentively to what they're saying, but avoid getting drawn into their grandiose stories or debates. Show empathy and acknowledge their feelings, but don't validate their self-importance.\n5. **Don't enable their behavior**: Avoid rescuing or covering up for narcissists' mistakes or flaws. This can create a cycle of dependence and reinforce their sense of superiority.\n6. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who are genuinely supportive, empathetic, and respectful. This can help counterbalance the negative effects of dealing with narcissists.\n7. **Take care of yourself**: Dealing with narcissists can be emotionally draining. Make sure to prioritize self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation or exercise.\n8. **Re-evaluate relationships**: If you find that you're consistently feeling drained, anxious, or unhappy in a relationship, it may be time to reassess whether it's a healthy and sustainable connection.\n\nTo avoid being narcissistic yourself:\n\n1. **Practice humility**: Recognize your limitations and acknowledge that you're not always right. Be open to feedback and willing to learn from others.\n2. **Focus on others**: Make an effort to listen actively, show empathy, and ask open-ended questions to encourage others to share their thoughts and feelings.\n3. **Avoid constant self-promotion**: Refrain from dominating conversations or seeking attention solely for your own gain. Instead, share your accomplishments and experiences in a humble and authentic way.\n4. **Be aware of your emotions**: Recognize when you're feeling anxious or insecure and take steps to address those emotions in a healthy way. Avoid using aggression, manipulation, or self-pity to get attention.\n5. **Seek feedback and criticism**: Encourage constructive feedback and criticism from trusted friends and mentors. Use this feedback to grow and improve, rather than becoming defensive or dismissive.\n\nRemember that dealing with narcissism requires patience, empathy, and self-awareness. By setting boundaries, practicing active listening, and prioritizing self-care, you can navigate these challenging situations and maintain your own emotional well-being."

Empathy is a vital human trait that helps build strong relationships and fosters a sense of community. The issue arises when it becomes overwhelming or blinding, leading you to compromise your own well-being.\n\nTo strike a balance, try these strategies:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" without feeling guilty. Prioritize your own needs and allocate your emotional energy accordingly. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Acknowledge your emotions and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect.\n3. **Develop emotional detachment**: Focus on understanding the situation, not getting emotionally entangled. This doesn't mean being uncaring, but rather, it allows you to maintain a healthy distance.\n4. **Limit exposure**: Establish a healthy distance from people who consistently drain your energy or engage in toxic behavior. Your mental well-being is important, too.\n5. **Cultivate self-awareness**: Recognize your triggers and patterns. When you feel yourself becoming overly invested in someone else's problems, take a step back and assess the situation objectively.\n6. **Focus on solutions, not just emotions**: Instead of solely empathizing with someone's feelings, try to help them find solutions or offer practical support. This can help shift your focus from being solely emotional to being solution-oriented.\n7. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and avoid those who drain your energy.\n8. **Practice mindfulness and meditation**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you develop emotional regulation skills, making it easier to manage your emotional responses.\n9. **Reframe your thinking**: When you feel the urge to apologize for someone else's mistakes or shortcomings, reframe it as \"I understand you're going through a tough time\" or \"I'm here to support you, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being.\"\n10. **Seek support**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.

We became friends very quickly and he felt like a friend I had known forever. On runs, he used to tell me very personal things.\n\nIt started to become sexual and felt like he wanted more. We met up for runs twice a week and he would tell me his relationship issues with his ex wife and his ex (I thought) girlfriend at the time. I was beginning to date girls and wasn’t interested in him romantically, but sexually it had been a while and we used to banter back and forth.\n\nWe did hook up, and then I realized I wasn’t really into what happened. I had told him I enjoyed his friendship but that’s what it was going to be: nothing more. He had previously expressed that he didn’t want to be boyfriend/girlfriend but seemed to treat me like one. He was very possessive of me and always wanted details of my sexual past and experiences with women. And men. It was off putting. \n\nA few months later, we reconnected. We did have a falling out after we hooked up. He told me he broke up with his girlfriend, but he actually had lied and never broke up with her while we were running buddies.

Here's the thing: confidence isn't just about speaking loudly or quickly, it's about speaking authentically and assertively. And the good news is that you can work on building that!\n\nFirst, start by practicing mindfulness and self-reflection. Get comfortable with your own thoughts and feelings. What are your opinions, values, and beliefs? What makes you tick? When you're more in touch with yourself, you'll be more likely to speak up without feeling like you're putting on a show.\n\nNext, identify your strengths and accomplishments. You might be surprised at how much you've achieved in your life, even if it's not necessarily in the spotlight. Focus on those strengths and remind yourself of them often. This will help boost your confidence and make it easier to speak up.\n\nNow, when it comes to speaking up, start small. Find a low-stakes situation, like a casual conversation with a friend or a small group, and practice sharing your thoughts and opinions. Don't worry too much about being \"right\" or \"wrong,\" just focus on being clear and respectful. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually work your way up to more challenging situations.\n\nAnother trick is to use positive self-talk. Instead of beating yourself up over your shyness, try reframing it as a strength. You might say to yourself, \"I'm taking my time to think before speaking, that's a sign of thoughtfulness and consideration.\" Or, \"I'm not rushing into things, I'm taking the time to make sure I'm saying what I mean.\"\n\nLastly, remember that confidence is not the absence of fear or uncertainty, but the willingness to take action despite those feelings. You don't have to be 100% confident all the time, but you do have to be willing to take the leap and speak up. And trust me, the more you do, the more confident you'll become!\n\nSo, take it slow, be kind to yourself, and focus on building your inner strength. You got this!"

She's turned it around, but I my doubts and resentment are  inhibiting me from fully loving my wife.\n\nMy long story below:\n\nMy   wife and I had been suffering from a semi-dead bedroom for a long  time.   When we had sex, it was ok.  But then we would go weeks without  sex.   Often it was only 1 or 2 times a month.  I would get turned down  often.   We had many, many talks...some of them very emotional about it.   She  would promise to change, and things would get better for awhile,  but  then things would go right back to where they were.\n\nBut  it wasn't  just sex that was missing.  It was intimacy.  I distinctly  remember  getting a haircut in Japan, and the woman did a quick scalp  massage  afterwards.  I remember being surprised by how nice it felt to  be  touched like that.  Then I realized that I hadn't been touched like  that  by my wife in a long time.  She always said it was because she was  just  so stressed out all the time between working and the kids.  So I  tried  to take as much off her plate as I could.  I started doing all  the  dinners and grocery shopping.  I became the primary driver of the  kids  to sports, etc.  Nothing changed.\n\nThen I started seeing the signs:  \n\\- She was distant  \n\\- low affection  \n\\- peck kisses  \n\\- low interest in family  \n\\- more interest in how she looked, putting on make-up more  \n\\- working late (she is a teacher)  \n\\- suddenly stopped wanting to receive oral sex\n\nThen   I noticed weird signs.  She changed the passcode on her phone. I   discovered it when I picked it up for something random.  We share   everything, so it wasn't unusual to use each other's phones.  She gave   me the password right away, and said she changed it because the kids   figured it out.  But it was just weird, you know?  And she didn't enable   her car to read her texts outloud...which is something she always  liked  about my car before she got the new one.\n\nBut  what really bothered  me was her absolute lack of effort for big  events.  Mother's Days were  elaborate.  Homemade poached eggs and  strawberry waffles in bed.   Picnics to every botanical garden withing  100 miles of our home.   Father's days were meh.  On our 20th  anniversary, I surprised her with a  trip to Paris and a diamond  necklace.  I started planning and saving  for it the day after our 10th  anniversary.  I worked with her boss to  schedule her time off and  ensure she had a substitute.  A week before  our 20th, she said she  still didn't know what she was going to get  me...ugh.  She did almost  nothing for my retirement after 25 years in  the military.\n\nI  became convinced she was cheating on me.  And once  I got that in my  head, it just wouldn't leave.  I kept it to myself,  but I was slowly  dying inside.  One day she had to work on Saturday (new  parent's).  She  got all made up.  Then, she called me from work and  told me she was  going to meet an old girl friend for lunch afterwards.  I  drove to the  restaurant and camped out...and then she came out...with  the girl  friend.  She didn't see me, but I was ashamed for having  doubted her.   But I still felt like something wasn't right.\n\nI  got  to go to Hawaii for a work trip and we decided to make a  mini-vacation  out of it.  I figured that this was our chance to  reconnect.  Away from  the stress of our daily lives.  After the second  time she turned me down  for sex, I finally lost my temper.  I blurted  out, \"Are you having an  affair?\"  She appeared shocked, then she cried.   But she swore up and  down no.\n\nWhen  we got back, she went to IC.  (I thought that was  weird, since I  finally agreed to MC, but she said that she needed IC  first).  Almost  immediately, everything changed.  She became crazy  intimate and crazy  sexual.  And it didn't seem forced.  She touched my  arm at dinner one  night, and I was amazed at how nonchalantly flirty it  was.  I was like,  where has this been for the last 10 years?  I thought  it may be the  zoloft she had started taking, but it turns out that  zoloft actually  reduces libido.  It honestly felt like she was  love-bombing.  It felt  like to me that she had been caught and was  trying to fix things.\n\nOne other thing I would like to mention.  \nOne  day a couple of years  ago, my wife mentions that she rode with a (guy)  parent (we'll call him  \"B\") to one of the field trips.  She works in a  private school, so they  rely on parent volunteers for field trips.   She talks about how nice  the guy is and how she thinks he and I would  get along.I tell her that I  am uncomfortable with her driving with male  parents, and I ask her to  avoid doing so if possible.  She agreed.   One of her co-workers was once  really aggressive in trying to have an  affair with me, and I built real  barriers to limit our interaction. (I  would never tell my wife, but I  was really tempted by the coworker). My  wife felt it was fair for her to  do the same thing.\n\nA  year later, we are at a school picnic, and  she introduces me to this  same guy \"B\" and his wife \"S\".  Over the last  year, our daughters had  become best friends.  But, the energy was just  weird.  He was really  awkward towards me, which I felt was odd since we  both had military  backgrounds.  But he seemed comfortable talking to my  wife.  And my  wife, who is pretty shy, seemed comfortable talking to  him.  Big red  flag for me.\n\nThen I find out he  was a firefighter  (my wife has a thing for firefighters).  Then I find  out (from my  daughter) that his station is literally within walking  distance of my  house.  Alarms are going off big time.  Again, no  personal emails.  No  texts.  1-2 emails about school work.  I remain  silent but vigilant.   One day when S and B's daughter is being dropped  off at my house for a  playdate, I spy through our ring doorbell the  interaction between B and  my wife.  (How crazy is that?!)  I wanted to  see how they interacted  when I wasn't around.  Nothing weird.  He  actually didn't even get on  the porch.  (but then again, it's obvious  we have a ring...see how my  mind is spinning?!)\n\nThen  this year, B and S withdraw their  daughter from the school.  Awesome, I  think.  Now my wife has absolutely  no reason to see him at all.  Then  my mom asks my wife to start a Girl  Scout troop.  My wife tells me, she  is going to ask S to help since S  and B are experienced campers.  The  thought of B being on a camping trip  with my wife is just something I  can't stand.\n\nLater, after a good   day, and after everything blows up and is getting better, I tell her my   concerns and ask her to cut them out of our life.  She has asked me to   cut out a few ex-girlfriends that I had remained friends with.  And I   did it willingly.  I felt it was fair for me to ask the same thing.\n\nI   must say, I was a bit disappointed in her response.  She said it felt   like I didn't trust her.  And she was sad to cut out two of the only   parents that supported her in her first year at that school.  I guess, I   was hoping she would say, \"sure honey\".  A couple of days later, she   agreed to do it, but I relented...mostly because I didn't want my   daughter to lose her best friend.\n\nMy  wife now tells me everytime  she sees B (due to their son still being  at my wife's school, but not in  her class).  My wife has refused to  drop off my daughter at their house  and instead sends me.  So I guess  it's ok.  But I still remember the  weird energy my wife and B had at  that school picnic.  And I am  resentful that that energy wasn't being  directed at me at a time when it  was missing in our relationship.\n\nShe  has continued to swear up and down  that there has never been anyone  else.  She even had me go to a session  with her therapist so that I  could maybe understand why she had been so  closed off.  And I have  found NOTHING.  I consider myself pretty tech  savvy, but I have found  nothing suspicious.  No text messages, no weird  phone records, no  emails, no weird locations...nothing.  But she is a  pretty smart girl  too, so I'm unsure what this proves.\n\nThe  fact  remains that I FEEL like she cheated on me.  I feel it in my  core, and  it is killing me.  The attention now is great, but I am so   resentful...and it is growing.  We attended my buddy's military   retirement last week, and his wife did so much for him.  It really   triggered all those negative feelings I had from before.  I'm just so   hurt and angry, and I can't come to grips with the fact that I won't   ever really know for sure.  To be honest, she told me that she feels   like she is suffering from having to regain my trust, even though she   never cheated.\n\nI just can't go on  like  this.  I feel like I deserved better, and I'm disappointed in  myself for putting up with so much for so long.  I had made up my mind  to leave  after the Hawaii incident, but didn't tell her.  Seeing the  work she has  put in made me stay.  But now I don't know if its enough.   Or maybe its  too little, too late.  But it would also be ridiculous  for me to split  up our family over actions she did over the last decade  when she is making so much of an effort now.",
    "human": "Sounds to me like you should go see a therapist as well.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, you've been through a lot, and it's no wonder you're feeling hurt, angry, and uncertain about your marriage. It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of resentment and doubt for a long time, and it's affecting your ability to fully love and connect with your wife.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you felt the need to accuse your wife of cheating, given the lack of intimacy and affection you were experiencing in your relationship. It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're not being heard or seen in their relationship, and that can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.\n\nHowever, I also understand why your wife might feel hurt and defensive about being accused of infidelity, especially when she's been working hard to improve your relationship. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it's clear that there's been a lot of hurt and misunderstandings on both sides.\n\nIt's great that your wife has been working on herself and making an effort to improve your relationship. However, it's also important to recognize that rebuilding trust takes time, effort, and commitment from both partners. It's not just about your wife \"fixing\" things, but also about you being willing to work through your feelings and doubts with her.\n\nI want to encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings and concerns. It's okay to express your hurt and anger, but also try to listen to her perspective and understand where she's coming from. It's possible that there were things going on in her life that she wasn't aware of or didn't communicate effectively, and it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you can't control what happened in the past, but you can control how you respond to it. Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on building a stronger and more open relationship with your wife moving forward. This may mean setting boundaries, communicating openly and honestly, and working through your feelings and doubts together.\n\nRemember, relationships are about growth, communication, and compromise. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. I encourage you to take things one step at a time, focus on the present, and work towards building a stronger and more loving relationship with your wife."

Unfortunately we both graduated and found jobs in different places so we are firmly long distance now. He’s visiting my new place which we were both super excited about! And before he came, he told me his feelings and said he wants me to be his girlfriend despite the distance. I thought about it and was down to give it a try. \n\nWe both have little experience in dating/relationships. \n\nWell, now he’s here, it’s been a week. We have a lot of fun as always, and we’re getting a little physically intimate. But then, he drops the bomb on me that he’s actually NOT sure he wants me to be his girlfriend anymore! He thinks the distance might be too scary, and he’s not sure about his feelings, and he might not want kids in the future…\n\nBut he still wants to date me exclusively. And he wants to think more about his feelings. \n\nI am so confused. And confused is not a good place to be! Apparently he’s had feelings for me for a year, and I literally just agreed to give this a try, and suddenly he’s like nope?\n\nHe says he is really sorry about this and he can leave if that makes me more comfortable. I don’t want him to leave, he makes me happy when he’s here, but what should I do with him?\n\nI think for me, you either date non exclusively, or you are exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend. Or you’re friends, of course.

    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling confused, upset, and scared.\n\nFirstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that his sudden change of heart is not your fault. It's okay to acknowledge your feelings and boundaries, and it's reasonable to expect clarity and commitment from someone who's considering a relationship with you.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think you have a few options:\n\n1. **Have an honest conversation**: Sit down with him and express your concerns and feelings. Let him know that you're hurt and confused by his sudden change of heart. Be clear about your boundaries and what you're looking for in a relationship. You can say something like, \"I understand that you're unsure about your feelings, but I was really excited about the possibility of being in a relationship with you. I need more clarity and commitment from you before we can move forward. Can we talk about what you're looking for in a relationship, and what you're willing to work on to make it work?\"\n2. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take some time to reflect on what you want from a relationship. Are you willing to date someone who's still unsure about their feelings? Are you comfortable with the uncertainty and potential for him to change his mind again? If not, it might be better to re-evaluate your feelings and consider whether you're better off as friends.\n3. **Set boundaries**: If you decide to continue seeing him, set clear boundaries around intimacy. You mentioned you don't feel comfortable with physical intimacy without a commitment, so it's essential to communicate that clearly. You can say, \"I care about you, but I don't feel comfortable with intimacy without a clear commitment from you. Can we focus on building a connection and getting to know each other better before we take things to the next level?\"\n4. **Consider a temporary pause**: If you're not ready to continue the relationship in its current state, it's okay to suggest a temporary pause. You can say, \"I need some time to process my feelings and figure out what I want. Can we take a break from seeing each other for a little while and focus on our own growth and clarity?\"\n\nRemember, your feelings and boundaries are valid. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take the time you need to figure out what you want.\n\nAs for your concerns about his potential to change his mind again, it's understandable to be wary. However, you can't control someone else's feelings or actions. What you can control is how you respond to the situation and what you're willing to accept in a relationship.\n\nLastly, try not to blame yourself for his actions. This is not a reflection of your worth or attractiveness. It's simply a sign that he's not ready for a commitment, and that's okay."

That's a huge step in building a stronger bond with your brother and creating a more comfortable viewing experience for both of you.\n\nHere's a suggestion: before you start the game, you could casually bring it up in conversation. You could say something like, \"Hey bro, I wanted to talk to you about the game we're about to play. I know it has some mature themes and suggestive content, and I want to make sure we're both comfortable with that. Have you given any thought to how you feel about that kind of stuff?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation, and it allows your brother to share his thoughts and feelings without feeling judged or pressured. You might be surprised by what he has to say, and it could help you both feel more at ease when those moments come up during the game.\n\nIf your brother is okay with the content, you could also discuss some ground rules for how you'll handle those scenes. For example, you could agree to skip over them or pause the game if either of you feels uncomfortable. Having a plan in place can help reduce the awkwardness and make the experience more enjoyable for both of you.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and boundaries, too. If you're not comfortable with certain types of content, it's perfectly fine to speak up and set those boundaries.

He has numerous times this week looked at a coworker's Facebook and instagram profile, searching for her on Google and stuff just to see what comes up. He went on a work trip just recently with her and other coworkers and it started after that. We live together and have a shared computer. That’s how I found out. We’ve been together for a year and a half and we’re in a very happy relationship, but I find this really off-putting. Makes me question things about him and his feelings towards me.\n\nThis saddens me as it’s a reoccurring behaviour of his. He’s done this before with other girls, like girls he used to date and a girl that worked at the same gym he went to, but now it’s his coworker. I’ve talked to him about this before when he was googling his ex a lot. I told him that it made me uncomfortable and he was very regretful. He won’t seem to stop this behaviour and it’s always girls or women he’s looking at, never male coworkers or so. How should I approach this?

Let's break this down and explore some possible approaches.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your boyfriend's behavior is not okay, regardless of his intentions. It's crossing a boundary and can be perceived as disloyal. It's not about being overly possessive or controlling, but rather about respecting your feelings and the commitment you've made to each other.\n\nSince you've talked to him about this before and he's been regretful, it's clear that he's not taking your concerns seriously enough. This time, it's crucial to have a more direct and specific conversation with him. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Choose a calm and private setting where you both feel comfortable.\n2. Start by expressing your feelings and concerns, using \"I\" statements. For example: \"I feel hurt and uncomfortable when I see you looking up other girls on social media. It makes me wonder if you're still interested in me or if you're just going through the motions.\"\n3. Be specific about the behavior you've observed and how it's affected you. You can say something like: \"I noticed you've been looking at [coworker's name] on Facebook and Instagram, and it's making me feel like you're not fully present in our relationship.\"\n4. Avoid accusatory language or blaming tone. Instead, focus on how his behavior is impacting you and your relationship.\n5. Ask him to reflect on his actions and how they might be perceived. You can say: \"Can you understand why this behavior might be hurtful to me? How do you think it would make me feel if I were in your shoes?\"\n6. Set clear boundaries and expectations. Let him know that you expect him to prioritize your relationship and respect your feelings. You can say: \"Going forward, I'd like us to focus on our relationship and not engage in activities that make me feel insecure or uncomfortable.\"\n7. Listen to his perspective and be open to understanding his thought process. However, be firm in your stance and don't settle for excuses or minimization.\n\nAs for how worried you should be, it's essential to consider the bigger picture. While his behavior might not be a deal-breaker in the short term, it can erode trust and create long-term issues if left unchecked. You deserve a partner who respects your feelings and prioritizes your relationship.\n\nIt's also worth considering whether you're willing to work through this issue with him or if you're willing to re-evaluate the relationship. Remember that you deserve someone who values and respects you, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n\nRemember to prioritize self-care and take time for yourself during this conversation. It's okay to take a step back and assess whether this relationship is truly healthy and fulfilling for you."

The fact that you're aware of your anxiety and want to change it is a huge step forward.\n\nNow, let's work on strategies to help you separate your work and personal life. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish a clear distinction between your work and personal time. When you're not working, avoid checking work emails, taking work calls, or engaging in work-related activities. This will help your brain associate work-free time with relaxation.\n2. **Practice mindfulness**: When you feel anxious about work, take a few minutes to breathe deeply and focus on the present moment. Ask yourself, \"Is this thought based on fact or assumption?\" and \"What can I control in this situation?\" Mindfulness apps like Headspace or Calm can help you get started.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: When you catch yourself worrying about the worst-case scenario, try reframing the thought to a more balanced perspective. For example, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" as you mentioned, or \"What's the best possible outcome?\" This can help shift your focus from catastrophic thinking to more constructive possibilities.\n4. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation outside of work. This could be exercise, hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or simply taking a relaxing bath. Schedule these activities into your daily or weekly routine to help you unwind and recharge.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your anxiety. Sometimes sharing your concerns with someone who cares can help you gain a new perspective or feel supported in your efforts to manage your anxiety.\n6. **Learn to accept uncertainty**: Recognize that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and it's impossible to eliminate all anxiety. Instead, focus on developing a growth mindset, being adaptable, and trusting that you'll navigate challenges as they arise.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits and thought patterns. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Celebrate small victories and acknowledge your progress along the way.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges, and it's okay to ask for help.

    "base_reply": "I sense a mix of frustration and vulnerability behind your question. It's understandable to want to protect yourself from the potential pain of emotional investment. However, completely avoiding connections with others might not be the most fulfilling or healthy approach. Here's a more balanced perspective:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establishing healthy boundaries can help you maintain a sense of control and emotional distance. Be clear about your needs and limits with others, and prioritize self-care.\n2. **Practice self-awareness**: Recognize your attachment patterns and triggers. Identify what makes you invest so deeply in others, and work on addressing those underlying needs. This might involve developing a stronger sense of self-worth, self-compassion, or exploring underlying fears and insecurities.\n3. **Focus on shared interests**: Instead of getting overly attached to individuals, focus on shared interests, hobbies, or activities. This can create meaningful connections without the emotional burden of intense attachment.\n4. **Maintain a sense of autonomy**: Keep your own identity and interests separate from your relationships. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, regardless of whether others are involved.\n5. **Develop emotional resilience**: Cultivate emotional intelligence, self-regulation, and emotional resilience. This will help you navigate the inevitable ups and downs of relationships with more ease and less attachment.\n6. **Practice detachment with kindness**: When necessary, learn to detach with kindness. Acknowledge the other person's value and worth, but recognize that you can't control their actions or emotions. Focus on your own well-being and growth.\n7. **Seek healthy relationships**: Surround yourself with people who respect your boundaries, communicate openly, and prioritize mutual growth. Healthy relationships can be a great way to build connections without the risk of overwhelming attachment.\n8. **Practice mindfulness and self-reflection**: Regularly reflect on your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Mindfulness can help you stay present and aware, reducing the likelihood of getting too caught up in attachments.\n\nRemember, it's not about completely avoiding connections or emotions; it's about finding a balance that works for you. By acknowledging and addressing your attachment patterns, you can develop healthier relationships and maintain a sense of emotional well-being."

The fact is tho you're most attractive when you're being yourself and don't give a fuck of it fits someone else's mold. I'm not implying that you should be an asshole. Just don't compromise who you are to get someone's attention.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Starting a conversation online can be tough, especially when it feels like everyone's got a formula down pat. But, I'm here to tell you that there's no one-size-fits-all approach. What works for someone else might not work for you, and that's okay.\n\nFirst, let's talk about why starting with \"hi\" might not be the most effective way to begin a conversation. It's a bit too generic, and it doesn't really give the other person a reason to engage with you. Think about it like this: if someone sends you a simple \"hi\" out of the blue, wouldn't you be a bit curious about what's behind it? You might be thinking, \"What's the context? What's the purpose of this message?\"\n\nInstead, try to find a way to connect with the other person on a more meaningful level. Here are a few strategies you could use:\n\n1. Find a common interest: Look at the other person's profile or posts and see if there's something you both have in common. It could be a hobby, a favorite TV show, or even a shared sense of humor. Use that as a conversation starter.\n\nExample: \"Hey, I saw that you're a fan of [insert shared interest here]. What do you like about it?\"\n\n2. Ask an open-ended question: Instead of asking a yes/no question, ask something that encourages the other person to share more about themselves. This can help keep the conversation going and give you more to work with.\n\nExample: \"What do you like to do in your free time?\" or \"What's been the highlight of your week?\"\n\n3. Make a thoughtful comment: If you're commenting on a post or article, take a moment to read through the conversation and add something thoughtful to the discussion. This shows that you're actually paying attention and care about what the other person has to say.\n\nExample: \"I completely agree with [other commenter's point]. I've been thinking about [related topic] a lot lately too...\"\n\n4. Show your personality: Don't be afraid to be yourself and let your personality shine through in your messages. This can help you stand out and make the other person more likely to want to keep talking to you.\n\nExample: \"I just watched the funniest video and I had to share it with someone. Have you seen [insert video here]?\"\n\nRemember, the key is to be genuine and authentic in your approach. Don't try to be someone you're not or use cheesy pickup lines. Just be yourself, and see where the conversation takes you.\n\nAs for jumping into a conversation, that's not a bad idea! Sometimes, adding your two cents to an ongoing discussion can be a great way to get involved and show your interest in the topic. Just make sure you're not dominating the conversation or interrupting others. Be respectful of the other people's opinions and thoughts, and try to add something valuable to the discussion.\n\nI hope these tips help you feel more confident in your online conversations!"

It's like your brain is trying to reconcile the old context with the new one.\n\nTo help you feel more comfortable, I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with your sister. Let her know how you're feeling and why. You can say something like, \"Hey sis, I've been feeling a bit weird about playing with your hair lately.

It's possible that she's not even aware of the sexual connotations you're experiencing, and a conversation can help you both find a new understanding.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, you could also have a conversation with her about your feelings. Let her know that you appreciate her asking for this gesture, but you're feeling a bit weird about it now. You can say something like, \"Hey, I love that you enjoy it when I play with your hair, but to be honest, it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable now that I've started doing it with my sister too. Can we find another way to connect and relax together?\"\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship. By being open and honest, you can work through these feelings and find new ways to connect with both your sister and your girlfriend that feel comfortable and respectful for everyone involved."

Thanks! :)",
    "human": ">I hate awkward silence in talkings\n\nThe word is *conversations*.  You dislike awkward silence in *conversations*...\n\nWhy is that?  \n\nYou could try to listen more and when you do, think about what the other person is saying.  Who is talking, what are they talking about (subject), where are they talking or where are they talking about, when is the story about (past, present, or future), and why are they talking to you about it?  While they are talking, think about a question you would like to ask them, like \"How did you become interested in that?\" or \"How do you feel about what happened?\" \n\nNow when you speak, think about what you want to say before you say it.  Engage your brain before your mouth says the words.  Ask those same questions to yourself, (who/what/when/where/why/how) and try to get it together in a sentence or two instead of a run-on paragraph.   Pretend you have to write what you say instead of just saying it.  That should cut down a lot of your excess verbiage (words).  You also might try recording yourself when you speak and if you notice you repeat yourself, or say a lot of filler words like \"um, ah, like\" make it a point to delete them from your conversations.\n\nI hope that helps.

That's already a huge step!\n\nTo help you reduce your talking and create more space for others, here are some tips that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When engaging in conversations, make an effort to focus on the other person. Give them your undivided attention, and try to understand their perspective. This will help you pause and let them share their thoughts instead of jumping in with your own.\n2. **Pause before responding**: When someone asks you a question, take a brief pause (even if it's just a few seconds) before responding. This allows you to gather your thoughts, and it also gives the other person a chance to fill the silence.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions or ones that can be answered with a simple \"fine,\" ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more. This will help you get to the point and reduce the need for lengthy explanations.\n4. **Use the \"3-second rule\"**: When you feel the urge to jump in and talk, count to three in your head before speaking. This tiny pause can make a big difference in allowing others to share their thoughts.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Being mindful of your thoughts and emotions can help you become more aware of your tendency to talk a lot. Take a few deep breaths, and acknowledge your feelings before responding. This will help you stay present and focused.\n6. **Set a goal for yourself**: Challenge yourself to let the other person talk for a set amount of time (e.g., 2-3 minutes) before you respond. This will help you build the habit of listening more and talking less.\n7. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up and start talking too much. Instead, acknowledge the mistake, take a deep breath, and refocus on the conversation.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to try new approaches until you find what works best for you!\n\nHow do these tips sound? Do you have any specific situations or conversations where you find yourself talking a lot?"

My partner and I have been together for 3 years, friends for over a decade beforehand, and his parents are paying for all of their adult children and adult children’s spouses/long-term partners, so I’m not the only person getting their way paid. Of course I did the whole thing of offering to pay for myself and they refused. At that point, I graciously accepted. No need to start an argument about money and frankly I (technically my partner and I) can’t afford to pay for this vacation anyway. That’s the entire reason why his parents are paying (that, and they are very well off). I mentioned this to my mom [50F] and she got angry. To her, it’s inconceivable that I am not paying for this vacation. She is going to “have a chat” with my partner’s family and insist that they either set up a payment plan with me or that she pay for her own daughter’s vacation (and my mom also said, in that scenario, I should pay her back). I feel very uncomfortable with my mom interfering in a financial agreement I’ve already made with someone else. They’ve already bought tickets and booked lodging. What should I do in this situation? Or what could I have done to avoid it? Should my partner and I give his parents a heads up for what is to come? Should I get into another argument and ask my mom to back off? Should I just ride it out?\n\nTl;dr - My partner and I are going on a vacation with his entire family; his parents are paying for everyone, including me. My mom is upset by this and is going to confront them in order to convince them to make me pay for myself.\n\nEdit/Update: I firmly told her to back off — that she should not involve herself in financial decisions of other adults. She said no and will proceed with her plan. I think she will only contact them via email; i don’t think she would go as far as to show up at their house, but i also didn’t think she would get involved in the first place. I’ve informed my partner’s parents about my mom’s stance and intent.\n\nEdit 2: i also just want to say that i appreciate everyone’s input! I know I have trouble setting boundaries when it comes to my mom. Everyone’s replies helped me have the confidence to stand up to her — it you all confirmed to me that she is the crazy one, not me, and that I’m not being rude or disrespectful by setting this boundary.

I want to make it clear that I appreciate their generosity, and I'm happy to accept their offer. Can we talk to your parents together and clear the air about this?\"\n\nAs for your mom, it's essential to maintain your boundary and not engage in an argument with her. You've already made it clear that you're not willing to discuss this further, and it's important to respect your own decision. If she continues to push the issue, it might be necessary to set some consequences, such as limiting your communication with her during the trip or taking a break from the relationship. Remember that you're an adult, and you have the right to make your own financial decisions.\n\nRemember, you're not being rude or disrespectful by setting boundaries. You're simply prioritizing your own well-being and autonomy. Keep in mind that your mom might not understand this initially, but it's essential to be firm and consistent in your boundary-setting.\n\nLastly, try to focus on the positive aspects of the trip and the opportunity to spend time with your partner and his family. You've already accepted their generosity, and it's essential to appreciate the effort they're putting into making this trip special. By setting a clear boundary and communicating openly with your partner and his parents, you can minimize any potential conflict and enjoy the trip without any added stress."

She's really nice and down to Earth, she immediately let me know she was into me and started sitting next to me during classes and being very friendly to me. I kinda look like Ian Somerhalder, false modesty aside lol.\n\nWe even argued in March. She basically did something very flirty (touching my belt) and I rejected her. I find her cute, but idk.. I'm not into her despite her being cute and super sweet. No rational reason really. Of course the fact I have a girlfriend is the main reason I'm not cheating, but what I'm saying is that I would've turned her down anyway. She started insulting me, I understood why she was acting like that.. she was mad because she'd been rejected. I told her something like ''you're really cute and sweet. And it's okay you hit on me, there's nothing wrong with this. But just because I'm a guy doesn't mean I like every cute girl. Plus, I have a girlfriend'' and she took it well. \n\nAnyway, we've stayed friends and despite knowing I'm not into her, she really likes being around me because  she's into me and she... I don't know how to say it? She sort of likes being taken care of because of that. Like, she wants me to be like a brother or something and every time I do something nice for her she's like ''awwwwww, I love you'' I enjoy it too because I like the fact she's into me even though this whole thing is platonic. \n\nI realize I sound like I'm looking for approval, but I'm genuinely curious. Is this whole thing wrong, unhealthy or whatever? Is this even considered cheating?\n\nTL;DR I have a girlfriend and I'm friends with a girl who finds me attractive and I enjoy the fact she likes me despite our friendship being very platonic",
    "human": "She's boundary-busting and trouble-making.\n\nShe will make trouble again.\n\nYou're choosing drama and validation, not friendship.\n\nAsk your GF is she considers this cheating/a violation of your agreement with her.",
    "base_reply": "I appreciate your honesty and self-awareness. It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on this situation and seeking advice.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your intentions are pure, and you're not looking for approval or trying to manipulate the situation. You're genuinely curious about whether this dynamic is healthy or not.\n\nIn my opinion, your situation is not unhealthy or wrong. You've set boundaries and been clear about your relationship status, which is important. You've also maintained a platonic friendship with this girl, which is great.\n\nIt's understandable that she finds you attractive and enjoys your company, but it's crucial to respect her feelings and boundaries. Since she knows you're taken, it's essential to ensure that your interactions with her don't lead her to feel like you're leading her on or giving her false hope.\n\nTo maintain a healthy dynamic, I would suggest being mindful of the following:\n\n1. Continue to prioritize your girlfriend and maintain open communication with her about your interactions with this other girl.\n2. Be respectful of your friend's feelings and boundaries. If she ever feels like you're not being genuine or is uncomfortable with the dynamic, listen to her concerns and adjust your behavior accordingly.\n3. Remember that it's okay to enjoy someone's company without romantic feelings. You can still appreciate her as a person and enjoy her friendship without compromising your values or relationship.\n4. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend about your intentions and boundaries. This can help clear the air and prevent any misunderstandings.\n\nAs for whether this is considered cheating, it ultimately depends on how you define cheating. Since you're not physically or emotionally intimate with this other girl, it's not a traditional form of infidelity. However, it's essential to be honest with yourself and your partner about your feelings and interactions.\n\nRemember, relationships are built on trust, communication, and mutual respect. By prioritizing these values, you can maintain a healthy dynamic with your girlfriend and this other girl, while also being true to yourself."

Now I've tried to learn English again since last year. Actually, I'm not sure if you can understand my writing. I guess this is filled with so many mistakes. I had a few chances to talk with someone who talk English, but I was so nervous and I couldn't say anything in the end. What if they tease me or ignore me? I want to be more confident.

I'm here to help you build your confidence and offer some tips to improve your English skills.\n\nFirstly, please don't worry about making mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's a natural part of the learning process. The most important thing is that you're taking the initiative to learn and improve.\n\nAs a Korean speaker, you have a great foundation in English already, and it's wonderful that you're revisiting your studies. What's holding you back from speaking, do you think? Is it fear of being judged or worried about making mistakes? Remember, the people you talk to are likely to be more interested in getting to know you than in correcting your grammar or pronunciation.\n\nWhen conversing with native English speakers, try to focus on the content of the conversation rather than the language itself. Ask questions, share your thoughts and experiences, and listen actively. This will help you build connections and establish a rapport with the other person.\n\nHere's a small exercise to help you build confidence: practice speaking with a language exchange partner, a tutor, or even a recording device. Start with short conversations, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. You can also join online language exchange communities or forums to practice writing and speaking with others.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself and celebrate your small victories. Every small step forward is a success, and it's okay to take your time. Remember that confidence grows with practice and patience.\n\nI understand that it may take time to overcome your fears, but I believe in you. You're already taking the first step by seeking help, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or encouragement.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm here to help you, not to judge you. I'm not perfect either, and I'm here to learn and grow alongside you. Let's work together to build your confidence and improve your English skills!"

It was complicated (with periods of international long distance) and it ended for complicated reasons (start of the pandemic), and I haven't dated anyone since. One of my nieces \\[7\\] asked me, in front of the whole family, why I wasn't married, to which my sister answered that maybe I didn't want to be and that's ok. Overall I thought that was a positive message to give to a child, so I didn't say anything else. Besides, it was a painful topic for me to discuss at the time as it had only happened recently.\n\nBut now they feel a bit too comfortable sharing memes and jokes about me not wanting kids, being perpetually single, being a cat lady... like they're too confident in their assessment that if this happened, it's because this is what I wanted to happen. That this is the situation I want. And it's not true. I feel like they're being too light and casual about something that was very difficult for me, and it's kind of a sensitive topic to just make it the butt of jokes. Sure, maybe that relationship went on for longer than it had to, and sure, I haven't been too proactive in dating again, but that's... none of their business, right? not something to joke about, right? \n\nAnyway, the jokes/snide comments have become way more frequent and way more casual and to my face, so... what do you say?

You can do this in a way that's not confrontational or aggressive, but still sets the tone for how you'd like to be discussed.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\nNext time someone makes a joke or comment about your relationship status, you could say something like: \"Hey, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not make light of something that was a difficult experience for me. I'm still processing and figuring things out, and it's not something I'm comfortable joking about.\"\n\nOr, if you feel more comfortable, you could add: \"I understand that you might think it's funny, but for me, it's not a topic I'm ready to joke about. I'd appreciate it if we could focus on more positive things.\"\n\nBy doing so, you're setting a boundary, but also showing that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings. This approach can help your niece and the rest of the family understand your perspective and be more considerate in the future.\n\nRemember, it's not about being overly sensitive or dramatic; it's about being honest and respectful of your own emotions and boundaries."

Here are some tips that might help you cope with your flight anxiety:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: Sometimes, knowledge is power. Research the plane you'll be flying on, its safety record, and the weather conditions for your route. Knowing what to expect can help calm your nerves.\n2. **Get familiar with the plane**: Take a virtual tour of the aircraft, learn about the safety features, and understand the emergency procedures. This can help you feel more comfortable with the environment.\n3. **Use relaxation techniques**: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your nervous system. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n4. **Choose a seat wisely**: If possible, opt for a seat over the wing, which tends to experience less turbulence. Avoid seats near the engines or in exit rows if you're prone to anxiety.\n5. **Use positive self-talk**: Instead of catastrophizing (\"I'm going to die!\"), remind yourself that flying is still the safest mode of transportation. Repeat positive affirmations like \"I've done this before and survived,\" or \"I'm prepared and capable of handling this.\"\n6. **Consider a support system**: Share your anxiety with a trusted friend or family member and ask them to be your \"flying buddy.\" Having someone you trust nearby can provide emotional support and distraction.\n7. **Medication or therapy**: If your anxiety is severe, consider consulting a therapist or discussing medication options with your doctor. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you reframe your thoughts and develop coping strategies.\n8. **Distract yourself**: Bring a book, puzzle, or deck of cards to keep your mind occupied during the flight. You can also download movies, TV shows, or music on your tablet or laptop.\n9. **Talk to the flight attendants**: Let the flight attendants know about your anxiety. They're trained to handle emergency situations and can provide reassurance and support during the flight.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you fly, the more comfortable you'll become with the experience. Try to gradually expose yourself to flights, starting with short trips and gradually increasing the duration.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean you're weak or irrational. By using these strategies, you can learn to manage your fear and develop a more positive relationship with flying."

Some employers may offer additional support for employees with high deductibles or offer a more comprehensive plan at a lower cost.\n\nSince you were previously on Medicaid, you might want to look into re-enrolling or exploring other Medicaid options. You can check your state's Medicaid website or contact your local health department to see if you qualify for coverage. Additionally, you can also check if you're eligible for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans, which may offer more affordable options.\n\nAnother option to consider is a short-term health insurance plan. These plans typically have lower premiums but may not provide the same level of coverage as a comprehensive plan.

When you're clear about what drives you, you'll be less swayed by others' opinions that don't align with your values.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries around what you're willing to share with others. This will help you maintain a sense of control over what you do and don't share.

Celebrate your small wins and acknowledge your efforts, even if others don't notice or care.\n4. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can.\n5. **Develop a growth mindset**: Embrace the idea that your worth and value come from within. Focus on learning, growth, and self-improvement, rather than seeking external validation.\n6. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who support and encourage you, and avoid those who bring you down or make you feel bad about yourself.\n7. **Develop a sense of purpose**: When you're doing something for the right reasons, you'll be less concerned about what others think. Find activities that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.\n8. **Reframe negative self-talk**: Challenge those critical inner voices by reframing negative thoughts into positive, empowering ones. Instead of \"I'll never be good enough,\" try \"I'm learning and growing every day.\"\n9. **Take calculated risks**: Step out of your comfort zone and take calculated risks. This will help you build confidence and develop a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on others' opinions.\n10. **Practice mindfulness and self-reflection**: Regularly take time to reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and actions.

Let me share some strategies that might help you overcome your fear:\n\n1. **Prepare, prepare, prepare**: The more you know your material, the less room there is for anxiety to creep in. Practice your presentation until you can deliver it smoothly, and make sure you're familiar with the content.\n2. **Focus on your message, not yourself**: Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the value you're trying to convey to your audience. Remember, you're speaking to share your ideas, not to impress anyone with your speaking skills.\n3. **Use positive self-talk**: Before you go on stage, take a few deep breaths and tell yourself you've got this! Remind yourself that you're well-prepared and that you're capable of doing a great job.\n4. **Visualize success**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself delivering a confident, smooth presentation. Visualize the audience listening attentively and responding positively. This can help calm your nerves and boost your confidence.\n5. **Get comfortable with imperfection**: Nobody's perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. Instead of fearing failure, focus on learning from it and moving forward.\n6. **Join a public speaking group or club**: Joining a group like Toastmasters can help you get comfortable with public speaking in a supportive environment. You'll get feedback, encouragement, and practice, which can help you build confidence.\n7. **Record yourself**: Record yourself presenting, and then watch the video. This can help you identify areas for improvement and build confidence in your abilities.\n8. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating well. Taking care of your physical health can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n9. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can all help calm your nerves. Experiment to find what works best for you.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: After each presentation, take time to reflect on what went well and what you could improve. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nRemember, overcoming public speaking anxiety takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. With time and effort, you can build your confidence and become a more effective public speaker."

    "sentence": "How to attract positive attention to yourself in a group. I've always felt left out when hanging out with a group of friends. I never seem to have anything to add, and since nobody talks to me, I end up saying weird things just to get their attention.",
    "human": "Probably the best Life Pro Tip is \"Don't worry about getting their attention\". Why do you need to? You can be the quiet one. That's okay. A lot of people feel insecure about this but they don't need to. And there are other ways than talking to include yourself. If you're smiling (genuinely) with the conversation, you're participating by listening.\n\nBut if you're really uncomfortable about that, here's a couple tips that I used.\n\nThink of non-weird things that you can say BEFORE you get into the group situation. Assuming you have something in common with the people in your group, try to remember a couple things you did about that sort of thing before you go out the next time with them. Then during a pause when a previous conversation has died off a little, insert it. \"Hey, I marathoned Show X on the weekend, thought it was awesome. Anyone see it?\" (And recognize that some people might diss that show in the follow-up chatting, and that's okay. They're hopefully judging the show and not you.)\n\nUse your google-fu to search out a few not-too-obscene jokes. Rip one out during those little quiet moments and you'll get cr",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. Feeling left out and trying to get attention can be really tough. First, let's break it down. You're feeling like you're not contributing to the conversation, and when you do try to join in, you're coming across as awkward. That's a tough spot.\n\nHere's the thing: you don't need to be the center of attention to feel valued and included. But, you do need to find ways to contribute and engage with the group in a way that feels authentic to you.\n\nInstead of trying to force conversation or say weird things to get attention, try this: focus on being an active listener. When others are talking, make eye contact, nod along, and ask open-ended questions that show you're interested in what they're saying. This will help you build connections and make others feel heard.\n\nAlso, think about what you're interested in and what you have in common with the group. Share your thoughts, experiences, or opinions in a way that feels natural to you. It might be as simple as commenting on a movie or TV show you both watched, or sharing a funny story that happened to you.\n\nAnother thing to try is to find a common ground with one person in the group. Build a connection with someone, and then gradually expand it to the rest of the group. This can make you feel more included and give you a sense of belonging.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take time to observe and absorb before contributing to the conversation. Don't feel like you need to be the first one to speak up. Sometimes, the best way to get attention is to be quiet and let others take the lead.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to find your footing. But by focusing on being a good listener, building connections, and being yourself, you can start to feel more included and valued in the group."

Before I never used them as an escape; I could enjoy them even tho sometimes I just did it because I was bored.

    "base_reply": "I get it. You're feeling like you're missing out on the simplicity and carefree nature of your younger self, while also knowing that giving in to old habits wouldn't be a healthy choice for you. It's a tough spot to be in.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing the negative impact those habits had on you and making conscious choices to abstain from them. That takes a lot of self-awareness and discipline.\n\nNow, about your question: can you live a happy life while maintaining bad habits? The answer is, it's possible, but it's unlikely to be a sustainable or fulfilling happiness. When you're aware of the negative consequences of those habits, it's natural to feel conflicted. You're trading short-term pleasure for long-term regret and potential harm.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that you're not just a one-dimensional person. You have multiple aspects to your personality, and it's okay to acknowledge that you miss certain aspects of your younger self. You're not just a self-improvement project; you're a person with desires, emotions, and needs.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to force yourself to be completely happy with your current habits, consider finding ways to integrate some of the things you miss into your life in a healthier way. For example:\n\n* If you miss gaming, try setting aside time for it, but with boundaries. You could play for a set amount of time each day or week, and prioritize other activities that bring you joy.\n* If you miss fapping, consider exploring other forms of relaxation or stress relief that don't involve those habits. You could try meditation, journaling, or creative activities.\n* If you miss drinking, you could try finding healthier alternatives, like having a glass of wine with friends or trying new non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nRemember, it's about finding balance and moderation. You don't have to cut out everything you enjoy; you just need to be mindful of your habits and make choices that align with your values and goals.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you don't find immediate happiness. Self-improvement is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Focus on progress, not perfection."

Choosing gifts can be tough, especially when you want to make it special and meaningful.\n\nFirstly, let's break down what's not working for you. You mentioned giving flowers, gift cards, and romantic dates, which are all lovely gestures, but you feel like they're becoming repetitive. This is a great opportunity to mix things up and get to know your partner better.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you become better at choosing gifts:\n\n1. **Pay attention to your partner's interests and hobbies**: What are they passionate about? What do they enjoy doing in their free time? Look for gifts that align with those interests. It could be a book by their favorite author, a piece of equipment for their hobby, or even an experience related to their passion.\n2. **Take note of their style and taste**: Does your partner have a specific aesthetic or style? Do they prefer classic and elegant or modern and trendy? This can help you narrow down gift options and make something more tailored to their taste.\n3. **Communicate with your partner**: Ask them about their preferences, even if it's just a casual conversation. You can say something like, \"Hey, I'm having trouble thinking of a gift for your birthday/anniversary/Christmas. Can you give me some ideas or tell me what you've been eyeing lately?\"\n4. **Experiences over material gifts**: Consider gifting experiences rather than physical items. This could be a cooking class, a wine tasting, a concert ticket, or even a weekend getaway. Experiences create memories, and your partner will likely appreciate the thought and effort you put into planning something special.\n5. **Personalize the gift**: Add a personal touch to the gift by including a handwritten note, a photo, or a special message. This shows you're putting thought and effort into the gift, making it more meaningful and unique.\n6. **Don't stress too much**: Remember, the most important thing is the thought and love behind the gift, not the price tag or how \"perfect\" it is. Your partner will likely appreciate the effort you put into choosing something special, even if it's not exactly what they wanted.\n\nLastly, consider setting a budget and sticking to it. This will help you feel less overwhelmed and more focused on finding a gift that fits within your means.\n\nI hope these tips help you become better at choosing gifts for your partner!"

Before we dive into technical solutions, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're frustrated with the slow internet speeds.\n\nAs for limiting your roommate's bandwidth without them noticing, I must advise against it. Here's why:\n\n1. Trust and communication: It's essential to address the issue directly with your roommate. They might not be aware of the impact their streaming habits are having on the others. Have an open conversation about the problem and see if you can find a mutually agreeable solution, such as setting aside specific times for streaming or finding a compromise on data usage.\n2. Technical limitations: While it's possible to limit bandwidth, it's not always easy to do so without your roommate noticing. They might have an idea of their data usage or notice changes in their streaming quality. Moreover, some methods might not be foolproof, and you might inadvertently create more problems.\n3. Potential for conflict: Implementing technical measures without your roommate's knowledge or consent can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. It's essential to prioritize transparency and respect in your living situation.\n\nInstead, I recommend focusing on finding a solution that works for everyone. You could:\n\n1. Set up a data usage tracking system: Use a tool that tracks internet usage, and discuss the results with your roommate. This can help identify areas where changes can be made.\n2. Establish a data plan: Create a plan for data usage that works for everyone. This might involve setting aside specific times for streaming or allocating data allowances.\n3. Encourage alternative activities: Suggest alternative activities that don't rely on high-bandwidth internet, such as board games, reading, or outdoor activities.\n\nRemember, effective communication and compromise are key to resolving this issue.

Now, let's work on moving forward.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to feel a sense of loss and grief after a long-term relationship ends, especially when you've invested so much time and emotions. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or confused. Allow yourself to process these emotions, but don't get stuck in them.\n\nTo put the past behind and find happiness again, focus on the present moment. Here are some tips to help you:\n\n1. **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, whether it's exercise, reading, or spending time with friends and family.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish a healthy distance from your ex, if needed. This will help you avoid unnecessary contact and allow you to focus on yourself.\n3. **Explore new interests**: Try new hobbies, take up a new sport, or join a club/group that aligns with your passions.

Reflect on what you want to achieve in life, and make a plan to get there.\n5. **Forgive yourself and your ex**: Holding onto resentment can weigh you down. Practice forgiveness, not for their sake, but for yours. Let go of the need to be right and the need to control the situation.\n6. **Create new routines**: Break free from the old routine and create new ones. Try new places, foods, and activities. This will help you feel like you're moving forward.\n7. **Give yourself time**: Healing takes time, and it's okay to not be okay immediately. Be patient with yourself, and don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over it\" by a certain time.\n8. **Surround yourself with positivity**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you. Avoid negative influences that might hold you back.\n9. **Practice mindfulness**: Focus on the present moment, and try to let go of worries about the past or future. Mindfulness exercises can help you stay grounded and centered.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small achievements, like trying a new recipe or completing a challenging task. This will help you build confidence and momentum.\n\nRemember, happiness is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take your time, and it's normal to experience ups and downs.

There were some costs involved in prep (around $800) that I fronted. I am VP of a tech company.

Your partner should understand that you can't just drop everything to attend the gallery opening.\n\nIt's interesting that your partner is now saying he's known the exact date and time for a month. This lack of transparency is concerning, and it's no wonder you're feeling upset.\n\nHere's what I would suggest: have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how his lack of communication has affected you. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example:\n\n\"I feel frustrated and disrespected when you don't communicate important details with me. I understand that you're excited about your gallery opening, but I need to prioritize my work commitments. Can we find a way to make this work, or is it possible to reschedule the event?\"\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge your partner's feelings and concerns.

Can we brainstorm ways to promote the event or attract more attendees?\"\n\nRemember to listen actively to your partner's concerns and work together to find a solution. It's possible to find a compromise that works for both of you.\n\nLastly, it's essential to recognize that this is not just about the gallery opening, but about the underlying issues in your relationship.

If you're not comfortable with direct eye contact, a slight head tilt or a gentle nod can work.\n4. **Redirect the conversation**: When she's on a roll, try to steer the conversation back to the topic at hand or a more relevant issue. You can say, \"That's interesting, but let's focus on [specific topic].\"\n5. **Limit meeting time**: If you're in a meeting or discussing a specific topic, set a timer or establish a time frame for the conversation. This can help keep her on track and prevent her from dominating the discussion.\n6. **Schedule separate meetings**: If possible, schedule one-on-one meetings with her to discuss specific topics or issues.

Explain how her behavior affects you and the team, and ask her to be more considerate of others' time and opinions.\n\nRemember to stay calm, patient, and professional when dealing with this situation. Avoid being confrontational or dismissive, as this can escalate the issue. By setting clear boundaries and being respectful, you can help create a more productive and respectful work environment."

    "base_reply": "The age-old temptation to relate! While it's natural to want to connect with someone by sharing a similar experience, doing so too frequently can indeed become a barrier to genuine connection. Here's why:\n\n1. It can shift the focus from the person telling the story to you and your own experiences.\n2. It may come across as a way to one-up or compete with the other person's story, rather than truly empathize with them.\n3. It can make the other person feel like they're not being heard or validated in their unique experience.\n\nSo, how do you agree and relate without making it about you? Try these tips:\n\n1. **Active listening**: Focus on fully understanding the other person's story, asking clarifying questions, and acknowledging their emotions.\n2. **Reflective listening**: Reflect back what you've heard to show you understand and care. For example, \"I can imagine how frustrating that must have been for you.\"\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Encourage the person to share more by asking open-ended questions that begin with what, how, or why.\n4. **Avoid giving unsolicited advice**: Unless the person explicitly asks for advice, focus on offering emotional support and validation instead.\n5. **Show empathy without comparing**: You can express empathy without sharing a similar experience. For example, \"That sounds really tough. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to show you care and understand the person's feelings, not to turn the conversation into a competition or a platform for your own stories. By following these tips, you can build deeper connections and create a safe space for others to share their experiences."

It's like being stuck in a never-ending cycle of unresolvable conflicts.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges in their relationships. It's essential to recognize that your wife's behavior is not about you, but about her own emotional struggles and coping mechanisms.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you navigate these issues:\n\n1. **Set clear boundaries**: Since your wife is unwilling to engage in therapy or anger management, it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Establish a boundary by telling her that you're willing to discuss specific issues, but you need concrete examples and concrete solutions. If she's unwilling to provide those, it may be necessary to re-evaluate the relationship.\n2. **Practice active listening**: When discussing issues, focus on understanding her perspective without getting defensive or accusatory. Ask open-ended questions to clarify her concerns, and try to paraphrase what you've understood. This can help her feel heard and validated, which may reduce tension.\n3. **Avoid taking the bait**: When she says \"Try to be a better husband\" or \"You should just figure it out,\" recognize that these statements are not constructive. Refrain from taking the bait and instead, ask for specific examples or guidance. This can help you avoid getting stuck in a cycle of blame and resentment.\n4. **Focus on what you can control**: Since you're already contributing equally to household chores and spending quality time with the kids, focus on what you can control: your own reactions and responses. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n5. **Re-evaluate the relationship**: It's essential to assess whether this relationship is healthy and sustainable for you. Consider seeking support from a therapist or trusted friends and family to gain a different perspective. If you feel consistently drained, unhappy, or unfulfilled, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and consider what's best for you.\n\nRemember, you can't force someone to change or engage in therapy. However, you can control how you respond to the situation. By prioritizing your own emotional well-being and setting clear boundaries, you may be able to create a more positive and constructive dynamic in your relationship."

Label it as \"worry\" and let it pass. Don't engage with it.

This helps to anchor you in the present.\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: When you're worried about something, try to reframe it as a \"what if\" scenario.

This can help distract you from worrying and provide a sense of control.\n7. **Seek support**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend or family member.

Start with small changes and be patient with yourself. You got this!\n\nWhich one of these strategies resonates with you the most, or is there something else that's been working for you?"

My boss at job #2 is a complete and utter prick. I want to quit without a two weeks notice because I don't need/want that stress and negativity in my life, and I know stress and negativity are unavoidable in life, but removing this particular form of it from my life would be a great release. Since I have a second job I can afford to quit, and pick up a new job some point later (I only need minimum wage.) Along with that, they (and my primary job) have me scheduled for the Fourth of July (which is also the birthday of one of my youngest family members). If I actually didn't mind the job, I'd have no issue working that day, but since I absolutely loathe it, I'd rather not miss out on my baby nieces birthday. Any tips for this?

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're considering your long-term well-being! Quitting a job without notice can be a big decision, and it's great that you're thinking carefully about the potential consequences.\n\nFirstly, it's understandable that you want to quit a job that's causing you so much stress and negativity. It's essential to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially at a young age.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consider the potential impact on your future employment prospects. Quitting without notice can leave a bad impression on your previous employer and potentially harm your reputation. It's essential to weigh the benefits of quitting against the potential costs.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your boss: Instead of quitting without notice, you could try having a conversation with your boss about your concerns and see if there's anything they can do to improve the work environment. This might help you feel heard and understood, and who knows, it could even lead to positive changes.\n2. Offer to train someone else: If you're concerned about leaving your colleagues in the lurch, offer to train someone else to take over your responsibilities before you leave. This shows that you're considerate of the impact your departure might have and willing to make the transition smoother.\n3. Be prepared for the potential consequences: If you do decide to quit without notice, be prepared for the potential consequences. You might face negative reviews on your social media profiles or difficulty getting future employment. However, if you're willing to take the risk, you can use this as an opportunity to focus on your well-being and find a job that's a better fit for you.\n\nRegarding your second job, it's great that you have another source of income. You might consider discussing your schedule with your primary job and seeing if they can accommodate your Fourth of July plans. If not, you could try to find a temporary replacement or take a day off without pay.\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. It's better to take a break and recharge than to burn out and potentially harm your long-term prospects. Take your time, weigh your options carefully, and make a decision that aligns with your values and goals.\n\nWhat do you think about these suggestions?

It doesn't make you better, it just makes you more produced, \n\nThen, realize that all the most exciting ideas which have never been spoken; could be stuck, twisted around the tongues of people who have perhaps not had the same privileges, who lack the academic frills which inspire you to listen and respect them. Perhaps they can't find the words, perhaps they talk in riddles, perhaps they are onto something... Now are you arrogant; so that you blow these people off, with no intent to find out what they are thinking? Or are you actually really smart...are you the guy that can decipher another person's unique genius?\n\nRealize that there are other types of intelligence.

Recognizing the impact of your words and actions is a huge step forward.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the issue of treating people with respect and understanding. You've already acknowledged that you've been nice to your friend, which is great. To take it to the next level, try to focus on the person's effort and dedication rather than their natural aptitude. Acknowledge the hard work they put in, and show appreciation for their unique strengths. This will help shift your perspective from comparing intelligence to celebrating individual achievements.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"is he/she smart?\" question, it's essential to reframe your response. Instead of directly answering whether someone is \"smart\" or not, try to focus on their strengths and abilities. You could say something like:\n\n* \"I think [name] is really good at [specific skill or subject].\"\n* \"I appreciate [name]'s unique perspective on [topic].\"\n* \"I've learned a lot from [name]'s experiences and insights.\"\n\nThis approach shows that you value the person's contributions and abilities without making judgments about their intelligence. Remember, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's essential to recognize and appreciate those differences.\n\nTo further develop your empathetic skills, try to put yourself in others' shoes. Ask yourself:\n\n* How would I feel if someone made me feel inferior or stupid?\n* What would I want someone to say to make me feel more confident and valued?\n\nBy practicing active listening, showing genuine interest in others, and focusing on their strengths, you'll become more attuned to their feelings and concerns. This will help you build stronger, more meaningful relationships and create a more positive environment for everyone involved.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to acknowledge and celebrate your own achievements, but do so in a way that doesn't make others feel left out or inferior. You've worked hard for your 3.9 GPA, and that's something to be proud of! Just be mindful of how you share your accomplishments and make sure to include others in your celebrations.\n\nKeep working on your self-awareness, and you'll become a more empathetic and understanding individual."

Acknowledge his feelings: While it's not your fault that you're taller, it's important to acknowledge your brother's emotions.

Don't push him to talk or confront him if he's not ready. Let him know that you're there for him when he is.\n5. Consider having a mediated conversation: If things don't improve, consider having a mediated conversation with your brother, possibly with a family therapist or counselor. This can help you both express your feelings and work through the issue together.\n\nRemember, your brother's reaction is a reflection of his own insecurities and struggles, not a reflection of your worth or value as a person. You are still the same amazing sister you've always been, and your height doesn't define your relationship or your worth."

Is the issue a matter of personal opinion or a fundamental principle? If it's the latter, it might be worth speaking up, as it can spark important discussions and learning opportunities.\n2. Are you speaking up to genuinely contribute to the conversation or to prove a point? Make sure your intentions are pure and not driven by a desire to \"win\" an argument.\n3.

Instead of directly contradicting someone, try framing your thoughts as questions or observations, which can help to spark a more collaborative discussion.\n\nIn your example with the professor, it's understandable that you felt uncomfortable sharing your opposing thoughts, especially since you received opposition in return.

Playing it cool is a great approach, and I'm happy to help you with that.\n\nFirstly, let's break it down:\n\n**When someone is being rude to you:**\n\n1. **Stay calm**: Take a deep breath, count to 10, or step away for a sec to collect your thoughts. This helps you respond more rationally.\n2. **Avoid taking the bait**: Don't engage with their negativity or try to match their level of aggression. This can escalate the situation.\n3. **Use \"gray rock\" technique**: Remain neutral and unemotional, like a gray rock in the middle of a river. Don't react or show emotions, and don't take the bait.\n4. **Use \"I\" statements**: If you need to respond, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and thoughts without attacking the other person. For example, \"I feel uncomfortable when you speak to me that way\" instead of \"You're being really rude.\"\n5. **Set boundaries**: If the person continues to be rude, it's okay to politely but firmly set boundaries. You can say, \"I'd appreciate it if you could speak to me respectfully\" or \"I'm not comfortable discussing this topic.\"\n\n**When someone is being rude to someone else:**\n\n1. **Intervene if necessary**: If the person is being targeted and you feel comfortable doing so, you can step in to defuse the situation. Use the same techniques above.\n2. **Support the person being targeted**: Offer words of encouragement and support, but avoid taking on the role of the \"hero\" or trying to fight the person being rude. This can escalate the situation further.\n3. **Don't engage with the rude person**: Avoid arguing or matching their level of aggression, as this can lead to a physical confrontation.\n\n**When you're with a significant other or someone weaker:**\n\n1. **Stay calm and composed**: As the \"protector,\" it's essential to remain calm and composed to de-escalate the situation.\n2. **Support your partner**: Offer words of encouragement and support, but don't take on the role of the \"hero.\" Let your partner know you're there for them and willing to help if needed.\n3. **Don't try to fight the rude person**: Avoid physical confrontation, as this can put everyone involved in danger. Instead, focus on de-escalating the situation and removing yourself from the situation if necessary.\n\n**When someone is bigger, weaker, or smaller than you:**\n\n1. **Use your words**: Remember that physical size, strength, or age doesn't dictate your ability to defend yourself. Use your words and assertive tone to stand up for yourself.\n2. **Don't underestimate anyone**: Never underestimate someone based on their physical appearance. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.\n3. **Stay calm and focused**: Keep your cool and focus on de-escalating the situation.\n\nRemember, playing it cool and staying calm is key. Avoid physical confrontations, and prioritize your safety and the safety of those around you."

As you're getting married, it's essential to have open and honest conversations about your expectations and boundaries.\n\nI would suggest having a calm and non-accusatory conversation with your fiancé about your feelings and concerns. Explain how his behavior is making you feel and ask him to consider your perspective.

I lost all my confidence to talk to strangers, I started hating myself more and more, I'm scared that I might have social anxiety.\n\nSo in this upcoming semester I really hope that I could start fresh.

Many people struggle to make connections and build friendships in college, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed.\n\nAs for striking up a conversation with a stranger, I want to tell you that it's not about being \"paranoid\" or thinking you're being rude. It's simply a skill that takes practice, and it's okay to start small.\n\nHere's a simple tip: try to find common ground with someone. It could be a shared interest, a class you're taking, or even a funny meme you both saw online. The goal is to find something you both have in common, and then build from there.\n\nWhen introducing yourself, try to focus on the other person rather than yourself. Ask them questions about themselves, and actively listen to their responses. This shows that you're genuinely interested in getting to know them, and it can help take the spotlight off yourself.\n\nAnother tip is to start with small, low-stakes interactions. Try saying hello to someone in your class or dorm, or striking up a conversation with a friend of a friend. These small interactions can help you build confidence and get comfortable with talking to others.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to make friends or have a certain number of acquaintances. Focus on building meaningful connections with people who share your interests and values, and don't be afraid to take time for yourself when you need it.\n\nRemember, social anxiety is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are worthy of connection and friendship, regardless of how many people you know or don't know. Keep being kind to yourself, and don't give up.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these tips out? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to add?"

I've been talking about wanting to own a dog since I met my husband, but I wanted to wait until we got a house, which was recently.  My husband told me he wasn't excited to to have a  dog, but he'd be okay with getting one for me and would help out. I'd take the walks, the training, the playing, the potty breaks, and he'd take a potty break or two. No worries. That's fine with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got a puppy. We've had her for two months now, and husband told me he doesn't like her and she is stressing him out, which boy, do I see! He wants to rehome her because she doesn't make our house feel like a home but a second job anymore. I'm not too worried about rehoming her. If we do go down that route, she's the cutest thing in the world and finding a good home for her will be easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe talked about why the puppy was stressing him out so much. Turns out my husband has lots and lots of bad memories about dogs. He had an abusive ex right before we started dating, and she was an animal hoarder who constantly asked him to dogsit, and her family did too. He thought he would be okay with a dog, but now isn't sure he could ever live with a dog, but I have found having a dog to be the most rewarding thing in the world. I don't want kids, so I treated the dog like a kid. I loved making frozen kongs for her, teaching her tricks, seeing her learn how windows work, all that stuff! I even wanted to get into dog sports with her. I was ready to become a capital D Dog person. But it looks like my husband might never be okay with a dog. And that sucks. But I love my husband and also want him to be happy. We have cats, and he loves them so much and sings them silly little songs and picks them up and dances with them, and he's never shown that kind of interest in the puppy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Husband and I got a dog. I have never found anything as rewarding as having a dog, but husband is finding that he can't stand dogs and doesn't want to come to one everyday, so uh, this sucks. Any advice?",
    "human": "I grew up with both dogs and cats. Our dogs were well-trained, not destructive, got along with our cat... and let me tell you. I am NOT a dog person. I don't hate dogs, but being around puppies just makes me stressed out. I hate slobber, I don't like the energy, just... I probably sound like the worst sort of person to someone who likes dogs! \n\nThat being said, your husband did say he'd be willing to try and that is on him. Making the decision to get a pet is a big commitment. I definitely think you should not have gotten a puppy and that was a disaster in the making but, what's done is done. \n\nWhat helped me with dogs growing up is having spaces that were mine that I could retreat to, and not having caretaking responsibilities the majority of the time (I did help when needed without issue). On the flip side, I was 100% responsible for cat caretaking, which I didn't mind at all. No dogs in my room, no walking/backyard crap responsibilities unless someone was sick or out of town. I was much happier and more willing to play with them and pet them and stuff when I was in the mood and they were ofc super friendly. The only pet dog we had that I never luke-warmed up to was the one that chased my cat. :( \n\nTherapy probably would be helpful, but the goal shouldn't be to address trauma (I highly doubt that's the issue and if you go in expecting him to magically like dogs afterwards, prepare to be disappointed because it doesn't sound like being triggered is his issue), but to help you guys figure out what his biggest issues are and if there are any compromises. My guesses are dog-free spaces, boundaries, professional training (especially if you are first time dog owners... my god a puppy without very structured training sounds like an actual nightmare to me). I think my biggest issue with dogs, come to think of it, is that so many are poorly trained. I thought that I liked dogs well enough till I met other people's dogs, since ours were so well behaved. I'm rambling now, so to sum it up...\n\nTL;DR: Couples therapy focusing on what you guys both need and want in your living spaces. Does he need boundaries and dog free spaces? Toddler gates work wonders. Less caretaking responsibilities? And dog training, with someone who knows what they are doing! He should be involved too so he understands how to communicate with your dog effectively.",

It's clear that you're deeply invested in your new furry family member and have found a sense of joy and fulfillment in caring for her. It's understandable that you're disappointed that your husband is struggling to adjust to having a dog.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your husband's past experiences with an abusive ex and animal hoarding are likely having a significant impact on his feelings about dogs. It's not uncommon for people to have emotional baggage that resurfaces when faced with situations that trigger memories or emotions. It's crucial to approach this situation with empathy and understanding.\n\nSince you've already had this conversation with your husband, it's essential to have an open and honest discussion about your feelings, concerns, and expectations. It's great that you're willing to prioritize his happiness, but it's also important to express your own needs and desires. You might consider asking your husband what specifically is causing him stress and anxiety around the dog, and see if there are any compromises you can make to alleviate those feelings.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore ways to make the dog's presence more comfortable for your husband. For example, could he have a designated \"me time\" or \"dog-free zone\" in the house? Are there specific tasks or responsibilities related to dog care that he's struggling with, and could you take on more of those responsibilities? Are there any dog-related activities or training exercises that he might find enjoyable or relaxing?\n\nIt's also crucial to acknowledge that rehoming the dog might not be the only solution. Have you considered exploring other options, such as doggy daycare, dog-walking services, or hiring a dog-sitter? These alternatives might allow your husband to have more freedom and flexibility while still allowing you to continue caring for the dog.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to prioritize your relationship and communication with your husband. It's clear that you both love each other, and it's possible to find a compromise that works for both of you. Remember that relationships are about growth, compromise, and understanding, and it's okay to work through challenging situations together."

    "sentence": "Tl;dr: met potential, surprising love interest on random long train journey; sibling who picked me up was extremely unfriendly and rude to them. It think it maybe killed the spark. Should I address directly, wait to see how the texts play out or just chalk it up to a nice travel moment and move on? I'm bummed!\n\nI had a really wonderful time with a seatmate on a train I took a few days ago. We were randomly next to each other, single, had surprising chemistry and spent several hours talking about everything under the sun. It's safe to say I'd never felt a connection like that before with a person traveling. We said goodbye and even hugged and he texted me immediately after I had left the terminal saying how much he enjoyed it and asking me to send a playlist I promised.\n\nI walked away on cloud 9 and met my younger sibling (27) inside the station. I hadn't had a chance to tell them what happened yet before my seatmate also bumped into us. He was excited to meet them (we had talked a lot about our families and siblings) and was also clearly on cloud 9 and my sibling was just  honestly openly unfriendly and hostile. When I introduced him by name, they asked how we met with an eye roll. When this fellow said \"on the train!\" with enthusiasm my sibling said coldly \"Yeah, she meets tons of people on trains. She's very chatty.\" and proceeded to ignore him completely while trying to hustle me away.  This isn't untrue, I do meet all kinds of people randomly, but nothing like what had just happened. It was so awkward. His energy immediately shifted and his face kind of fell. We said a second goodbye that wasn't as warm.  I was surprised and honestly really sad about my sib's reaction. My sibling later explained they thought maybe he was harassing me and as they were excited to see me they didn't want the interruption of a stranger, plus they just don't love meeting new people in general. They’re otherwise super warm and kind; we’re close.\n\nI texted him back warmly when I made it home that night several hours later, and followed up the next evening with the playlist. He wrote back the next morning (second morning home) with a nice note but nothing to really keep going on.  I don't know -- I think if he were excited he would have responded sooner. Is it worth saying something directly about the awkward encounter and being up front that I really liked our conversation and would love to continue it and say my sibling sends their apologies for being rude (they feel bad once I explained)? Me and this guy don't live in the same city but honestly I felt such a click that I'd explore further if he were interested.  I meet people I truly like about once every 5 years so this made an impression on me.\n\nUpdate #1: Wow, thx fam for all the replies and encouragement. And a Silver! I'll try to respond to the comments, but: \n\n1) I texted! I wrote a couple careful concise drafts and then they got deleted and I just said fuck it and wrote from the heart. Not as polished but sincere...it'll land or it won't. I'll keep you guys posted if it works out lol. I've had some really tough knocks with relationships, so if anything it was just nice to feel something like this and know that my heart is still capable of feeling a spark.  \n\n2) Sibling is a lovely person. I'm purposely avoiding gender for my own reasons, but they really aren't usually snarky. Just had a long day and in their defense they are not super social, saw an unknown man beelining for me and getting pretty physically close with no context, and are kind of tired of people chatting me up all the time when it's supposed to be our time together. They were super apologetic later when we talked. It was an irritable and careless mistake, not intentional. I told them not to worry.\n\nUpdate #2: Got a sweet reply saying the spark was mutual, no worries with sib, and that while it was lovely the distance is too much to really conceptualize what building something would look like. We live on opposite ends of the country. I hadn't really thought that far ahead but it was such a thoughtful reply. No hard feelings. Like I said above I am mainly happy that I could feel something in the ol' cold heart again and remind myself that good folks are out there.

But first, let's acknowledge that it's not going to be easy, and it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nHere's the thing: you can't just \"stop\" overthinking, but you can learn to rewire your brain to be more balanced and rational. It's all about developing healthy habits and strategies to cope with anxiety.\n\n1. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness meditation, even just 5-10 minutes a day. This can help calm your mind and bring you back to the present moment. You can use apps like Headspace or Calm to get started.\n2. **Reframe your thoughts**: When you start spiraling into worst-case scenarios, try to catch yourself and reframe those thoughts. Ask yourself, \"Is this thought really true?\" or \"Is there another way to look at this situation?\" Challenge those negative thoughts by reframing them in a more realistic and positive light.\n3. **Break things down**: When faced with a situation that triggers anxiety, try to break it down into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on one step at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture.\n4. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself! Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.\n5. **Exercise and physical activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, yoga, or dancing, and make it a part of your daily routine.\n6. **Talk to someone**: Share your struggles with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. Sometimes just talking through your thoughts and feelings can help you gain perspective and feel less alone.\n7. **Gradual exposure**: Gradually expose yourself to the things that trigger your anxiety. For example, if you're anxious about taking tests, start by taking practice tests or working on smaller assignments. This can help you build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n8. **Self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath. Prioritize your well-being and make self-care a non-negotiable part of your daily routine.\n\nRemember, my friend, it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

    "sentence": "I (F21) have entered a traumatic event today with my mom (43) and step dad (idk his age but mom is older by a few years)\n\nSo a couple of hours ago, I went out to the kitchen to make myself a homemade hot compress for my cramps. I was grabbing rice from the cupboard when my mom told me to stop wearing shorts when I know my step dad is around and told me that he isn’t my father so I shouldnt be comfortable walking around with what I was currently wearing (shorts and a tank top). I started to get uncomfortable so I quickly finished the hot compress I was making and went to my room. A couple of minutes later, my mom entered my room and told me that my step dad was staring at my butt and that she noticed it before too so I need to stop wearing tank tops and shorts when he is around. So I replied to her saying “why am I the problem? Why am I at fault?” And she said “thats why I called him out on it because I also noticed it when we were at the beach he was looking at the girls wearing two pieces. I know you can feel it sometimes” my mom also said she told his mom. I replied “I dont. Because I shouldn’t feel uncomfortable or that way around him” I didn’t want to argue because if I did I would cry so I just said id stop wearing it. The thing is I’ve always felt it. I always had a gut feeling. I was never comfortable around him at all so that feeling was confirmed today and I have never felt more traumatized in my life and I just want to bawl my eyes out. We all live in the same tiny apartment so I don’t know how I will be able to avoid him or how I will go on about this. I have nowhere else to go. I have no one to talk to about this except for one friend who isnt online rn. Please someone give me a solution before this becomes worst\n\nTL;DR - my mom told me to stop wearing shorts and tank tops around my step dad because he was looking at my butt\n\nEdit: Hey all. Thanks for the comments. Just to address everyone saying my mom should leave/shouldve left — I know it sounds like an excuse but it isnt but my mom can’t leave because she doesn’t have the money. If she leaves, we wouldn’t have a house to live in. We dont have any near family members (theyre all like in California and we are in the east coast or they’re all back in our home country). She wouldn’t be able to pay for an apartment because she doesn’t earn enough and she cant work for a week straight even if she wanted to because no one is going to take care of my 4 year old sister. I’ve asked her before to leave him before because he isnt just the best husband (financial problems, not responsible with house chores, not taking care of his daughter, etc) and this is her reason\n\nEdit: (UPDATE) Hey all, I just talked to my mom about how I plan to move out and she got mad at me saying I cant afford it and that I wouldn’t be able to save money because I’ll be working my whole life to just pay off bills. I offered that she leaves and we can just pay 50/50 for the bills and she said she can’t because she cant afford it and that her application for her citizenship will be harder to obtain and everything she worked for to get to the U.S will be gone. She said she cant afford the health insurance and everything if she divorced him and she didn’t have money for divorce anyway. So I insisted I can just leave myself for now and she got mad at me saying her husband isnt really like that and that something is just wrong in his brain and so I told her I dont want to wait for something to happen or for it to escalate and she said “nothing will happen he wont do anything” and that went on back and forth. She doesn’t want me to also tell it to my dad and his family. And now she’s threatening me that we go back home to the Philippines because “she cant do it anymore” and that she’s tired of tending to all of us and thinking about us. She called her husband and put me on the phone with him to tell him myself the problem and now she’s blaming me that we are gonna go back home to our home country and that her dreams were crushed. Also when I told her i was uncomfortable and didn’t wanna see her husband she told me i was overreacting just because of this one incident and that she wished she didn’t just say anything earlier so this/my reaction now didn’t happen. Edit: She said the only solution right now is for me to cover up when I go out of my room",
    "human": "I just read your edit. I’m so sorry you are in this situation. It’s very common for women to not be able to leave an abusive situation (which this is) because of finances. Now that she admits it, I would be very loud about his behavior. If he’s staring, say it. If he’s being inappropriate, say it. It’s going to be uncomfortable but you need to know there are more eyes on you to create at least some safety. Leaving it in the dark makes you more vulnerable. And keep it up till she is able and willing to leave. Hang in there.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you're feeling traumatized and overwhelmed. First, please know that you're not at fault for feeling uncomfortable or upset. It's not your responsibility to adjust your behavior to make someone else feel more comfortable.\n\nIt's also not okay for your mom to put you in this situation and then blame you for reacting the way you did. It's not your responsibility to \"cover up\" or change your behavior to accommodate someone else's inappropriate behavior.\n\nIt's clear that your mom is not taking your feelings or your safety seriously, and it's not okay for her to be putting you in this situation. It's important for you to prioritize your own well-being and take steps to protect yourself.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member who is not in the same situation as you. It might be helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer emotional support and validation.\n2. Look into local resources for domestic violence support groups or counseling services. It's possible that you may be experiencing emotional abuse or trauma, and seeking help from a professional can be beneficial.\n3. Consider talking to your friend who is online and is available to listen. It might be helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and advice.\n4. If you feel safe doing so, you might consider talking to your dad and his family about what's been going on. It's possible that they may be able to offer support and help you come up with a plan to get out of the situation.\n5. Remember that you don't have to stay in this situation. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and take steps to protect yourself. You don't have to live with someone who is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nRemember that you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it."

    "sentence": "How to start conversations with people? Strangers, friends, acquaintances, that cute girl that always gets the same kind of coffee, et cetera\n\nI have social anxiety so anytime I consider saying something, I think I'm being weird.  I would overthink everything, and then I realized I was overthinking so then I thought I'd relax and try to talk naturally.\n\nRecently asked a girl what she does in her free time and she said that's a weird question.  I thought that seemed like a normal question, so now I'm *totally* confused.\n\n\nAlso, how would I approach a stranger?  That's probably the strangest one for me.  No pun intended.",
    "human": "The only way I see that question as being weird is if you were stroking your genitals while you asked. I used to have the same social anxiety disorder. It always amused me that the acronym is SAD. But slowly I've overcome my fears, I still have problems making phonecalls, thank god for email lol. You've already started on a good path, asking questions and showing interest in what people have to say. You'll find not all people are like that girl and most are friendly and cordial. \n\nKeep at it, it gets easier.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! Social anxiety can be overwhelming, and it's great that you're acknowledging it and wanting to work on it.\n\nFirstly, let's tackle the \"what do you do in your free time\" question. It's not a weird question, but I can see why you'd think that. It's a great question to ask, actually! It's a way to show interest in the other person and find common ground. Maybe the girl you asked just wasn't in the mood to talk about her free time, or maybe she was having a bad day. It's not a reflection of you or the question itself.\n\nAs for approaching a stranger, it can be tough, but here's a tip: start small. You don't have to go in for a full-blown conversation right away. Try making small talk, like commenting on the environment or the weather. You could say something like, \"Hey, how's your day going so far?\" or \"Wow, this coffee shop is really cozy, have you been here before?\"\n\nIf you're feeling more comfortable, you could try asking a question that's more specific to the situation. For example, if you're both waiting in line, you could ask, \"How was your weekend?\" or \"Have you tried this coffee shop before?\"\n\nThe key is to be genuine and authentic in your approach. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to be interested in something you're not. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it can be off-putting.\n\nAs for your social anxiety, remember that it's okay to take your time and feel nervous. It's normal! Just acknowledge those feelings and take a deep breath. Remind yourself that the other person is probably just as nervous as you are, and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nLastly, try to focus on the present moment and the conversation itself, rather than worrying about how it's going to go or what the other person will think. Just be present, be kind, and be yourself."

    "sentence": "Edit: Thank you everyone for all the responses. Just being heard and validated has meant a lot and has allowed me to be in a better mental space. I will respond to as many as I can ❤️. \n\nI apologise for the long post but I feel like all the details are relevant. \n\nMy GF (30F) and I (30F) have been living together for almost three years. I recently graduated (after going back to university) and am looking for work in the field. I do however work as a freelancer and have done so for the entirety of my studies. The job is monotonous and repetitive but the standards are high and the margin for error is zero. Other than that it’s not a stressful job. \n\nMy GF works full time as a manager in a niche marketing company. She didn’t study anything related to marketing but got a job at the company right after she graduated and worked her way up to manager. Her job is stressful, time sensitive and she is constantly under pressure. \n\nI get that her job is stressful and empathise with the difficult position that she is in but the issue is that she constantly complains about her job to me. Constantly. We both work from home and so no time of day is off limits. If someone does something I get to hear about it and how pissed off she is in real time. I have moved out of our home office and into the living room behind a makeshift desk in hopes that it would stop but it didn’t. Last year while I was in the midst of studying for exams she would interrupt me to complain. If I tell her I’m busy at work and can’t listen to her right now she literally paces in front of me until I’m finished. \n\nThe worst part is she is constantly asking me what she should do, to help her, to give her advice. Just listening to her ranting and raving is not enough, she demands answers from me. I do not have a background in management, I have no experience in it. I have no experience in marketing and have never worked at her company. There are so many issues and problems that I have no idea how to tackle let alone solve. Sometimes I feel utterly helpless. \n\nThe worst thing for me is that she seems to constantly have a problem with everyone in the office. If anyone says anything ambiguous to her she immediately interprets it as criticism or some comment on her aptitude. I worked with her for months to try and understand and work with one of her coworkers (a more senior manager that she doesn’t answer to but is a textbook micromanager) instead of just getting angry at everything he says. \n\nWhen her she finally got on the same page as the previous manager, she started having a problem with another coworker (another senior manager). I get to hear about every little comment, every little email, every action he does and how it pisses her off. I’ve met this man, we have mutual friends with him so I’ve spent some time with him. While I’m sure he can be an asshole he just seems like a moron to me. If I was in her situation I would just roll my eyes at the things he said and correct any misconceptions he had with facts, statistics and a paper trail. \n\nI’ve told her to speak to her boss about being overworked and understaffed. Her company constantly pays for courses if it’s useful to the business and I’ve told her to ask her boss about enrolling in a management course but she just says she’ll think about it. I’ve told her to seriously consider looking for a new job but she says then she’ll just feel likes she’s giving up. I’ve literally googled the issues she has and then gave her the advice I found online. I got a friend of mine’s old management and HR textbooks for her to read and set her a schedule for 20 minutes everyday to go through them, but she doesn’t read them. She’s a workaholic and probably works 50 hours a week. I’ve told her that she needs to take work less, set boundaries, get some exercise and pursue other hobbies to break away from the constant work stress and just replenish her coping mechanisms. Her response is to double down and work more hours. I wake up early to go on a walk with her around the neighbourhood just so she can get some balance but she refuses saying she has too much work. \n\nIt seems to me that she doesn’t implement any of the solutions I provide. I’m starting to suspect that she’s using me as therapist to make her self feel better about the issues at work instead of actively working on the problems. Of course I don’t know what is happening at the company everyday because I only ever hear her side of things so I don’t know if things are truly that horrific or if she’s just misunderstanding or catastrophizing things. \n\nI cannot take it anymore. Maybe I’m selfish but I don’t want to listen to her complaining every single day multiple times a day. Every time she starts up I just get this feeling like I just want to run away. I loathe exercise and going to the gym but I’ve literally starting going for two hours everyday just so that I could have a space where she can’t reach me, where I’m free from her complaining (the only positive to this is that I’m in the best shape of my life.)\n\nI am constantly anxious. I never know if I’m giving her the right advice or if it’s making things worse. My mom was retrenched a few years ago and we lost our house and most of our possessions. I think that experience has traumatised me because I’m constantly afraid that my GF will lose her job. I have my own stress to deal with. I’m struggling to find work and my salary barely covers our grocery bill. But she barely knows about what is going on in my life, she never asks me about my day, we never do anything and all we talk about is her job. Last night I waited two hours for her to finish work because I wanted to watch a documentary and asked her beforehand whether she wanted to watch it too. The two hour documentary ended up taking four hours to finish because she kept pausing to do work. Things that other people are employed to do. \n\nI just cannot take it anymore. My GF is a workaholic I accept that but all we talk about is her problems at work. All she does is work. And now her problems at work have seeped into every aspect of my life too. \n\nTL;DR My GF constantly complains about problems at her work, even going so far as seeking me out to complain. While I empathise with her situation she constantly demands answers from me. I have no background in management and no idea to tackle these problems. I’m constantly anxious and worried that she’s going to lose her job. At the same time I just cannot take the complaining anymore and I feel like I want to run away.",
    "human": "Wow, it sounds like she's in great danger of pushing you away.\n\nI think you need to sit her down and tell her that her work is putting pressure on your relationship. Tell her how it makes you feel that you can't spend time together anymore, and how you've tried to help, but nothing seems to change. Maybe agree some boundaries together. For example, me and my SO have agree we can talk about work for 20 min at the end of the day, then we stop. \n\nThen, you need to start firmly establishing boundaries. If she tries to talk about work while you're working, tell her you're not in the right headspace and will discuss it later. If she paces, ignore her. Do not give in. Leave the room if she pushes you.\n\nIt may also be a good idea to start including some positives. Like organising a date night or a short trip away to reconnect.",
    "base_reply": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds incredibly draining and stressful. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious.\n\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that your GF's behavior is not solely due to her job being stressful, but also because she's using you as a sounding board to vent her frustrations. It's not healthy for her to dump all her problems on you, and it's not fair to you to expect you to be her therapist.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that you can't solve her problems at work, and it's not your responsibility to do so. You're not a management expert, and it's not your job to fix her job-related issues.\n\nGiven your own stress and anxiety, it's crucial that you prioritize your own well-being. You need to set boundaries with your GF about what you're comfortable discussing and how often you're willing to listen to her complaints. It's okay to say, \"I understand you're stressed, but I need some space/time for myself right now.\"\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your GF about how her constant complaining is affecting you. You can express your feelings without blaming or attacking her. Use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel, such as \"I feel overwhelmed when you complain to me about work all the time. I need some space to focus on my own stress and anxiety.\"\n\nIt's also important to prioritize your own self-care and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed. You deserve to have a healthy and balanced relationship where both parties support each other.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to set some boundaries around work-related conversations. You can say, \"I'm happy to listen to you about your job, but let's limit our conversations to [insert specific times or frequency]. I need some time for myself and our relationship to thrive.\"\n\nRemember, you can't fix your GF's job or her stress, but you can work on setting boundaries and prioritizing your own well-being."

Dear LPT,\n\nI am constantly on the move, I survive with only using a few things which I hold very dear. \n\nWhenever I return home I always feel cluttered and stressed with the amount of unneeded belongings that I own but never use; cosmetics, clothes, furniture. All with some sort of sentimental value, but I feel as if I threw anything away,it wouldn't be something I miss. \n\nI find it hard to sort and dispose of these things, as I feel they may come in use in the future.\n\nAny advice how I could tackle this would be very much appreciated!",
    "human": "Sort and box the excess.  If you haven't looked at it in 6 to 12 months you don't need it. While sorting ask yourself  \" how does x make me feel?\" If the feelings are negative you should get rid of x.

    "base_reply": "The eternal struggle of letting go of sentimental belongings! It's great that you're aware of the clutter and its impact on your stress levels. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you tackle this:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the value, not the attachment**: Recognize that the sentimental value lies in the memory or experience, not the physical object itself. This mindset shift can help you detach from the emotional attachment.\n2. **Categorize and prioritize**: Group similar items (e.g., all cosmetics, all clothes, etc.) and prioritize which ones you can part with. Be honest with yourself – are you holding onto something solely for sentimental reasons or because you genuinely use it?\n3. **Take photos and create a memory box**: For items you're struggling to part with, take a photo of it and create a digital memory box (e.g., a Google Photos album or a scrapbook). This way, you'll have a visual record of the item without having to keep it physically.\n4. **Set a \"maybe\" box**: For items you're unsure about, place them in a \"maybe\" box and set a deadline (e.g., 6 months) to revisit it. If you haven't used or thought about the item by then, it's likely safe to let it go.\n5. **Donate or repurpose**: Consider donating gently used items to local charities, thrift stores, or online platforms. You can also repurpose items, like turning an old piece of furniture into a planter or a decorative item.\n6. **Create a \"release ritual\"**: Develop a small ceremony to mark the letting go of each item. This could be as simple as saying a phrase, writing a note, or doing a small gesture of gratitude. This helps acknowledge the emotional attachment and creates a sense of closure.\n7. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to let go of items that no longer serve you. Be kind to yourself and acknowledge the progress you're making.\n\nRemember, it's not about getting rid of everything at once. Start with small steps, and as you become more comfortable with the process, you'll find it easier to let go of the items that are holding you back."

    "sentence": "Context: my gf and I have been together for three years. She’s been my rock and supported me so much through my phd that I am finishing in September. Admittedly, I’ve not been the most loving, romantic, or comforting in this time. I did continuously pick myself selfishly over her because sometimes the work was just so overwhelming. She stuck by me regardless, supported me through all my tantrums, and all this whilst over achieving in her own life and her own goals. I can’t really propose because I haven’t got a job lined up yet and not financially secure - we currently live with my parents. This is the girl i want to marry and I haven’t done a good job in telling and showing her that. I’ve been a bit of a unfair tbh and tho never cheated, i did break her trust a couple times. I just want to show her how grateful i am, how much i love her, and my commitment to her. I’m not a cringy guy and find all this lovey-doves stuff too much and awkward.

    "human": "&gt;I’m not a cringy guy and find all this lovey-doves stuff too much&lt;\n\nThis is the first fucking glaring issue you need to work on. Being cringey, and being lovey dovey are two different things. Showing the woman you love how much you love her through not just words, but actions are really you're only choice. There isn't a magic word you can say, or some super secret present you can buy (even a ring) that will say \"I'm sorry for being a selfish asshole that treated you bad and took advantage of you whilst you supported me through schooling\".\n\nGrow up, MD learn that showing feeling sand doing lovey dovey stuff doesn't make you any less manly than you already are. NOT DOING that stuff makes you less manly than you think, as a real man has no problem showing how much he loves someone. \n\nI kiss my girlfriend on the forehead every morning. Sometimes I make her hot tea, a bagel, pancakes before work. We both work from home, so whenever she's stressed from work we go take walks, I surprise her with little things that she loves. After work we sometimes need up on the couch where I rub her feet and legs a couple times a week. Whenever she is sick I'm there. Whenever we need to clean I do half of it. I cook dinner 3 times a week. Why do I do all these things? Not because im.some girly anti man, but because she FUCKING DESERVES IT. \n\nand youbwanna know what? I get the same thing in return. It's amazing how simple it is without all the bullsgit and drama. We've been together al.ost 4 years and haven't had a bad argument or fight once. We have discussions when we disagree, like adults. \n\nJust got back from a rad ass cruise and couldn't be happier. Ultimately if you think that cringey and too lovey dovey for you?

Take responsibility for your part in the situation and be honest with yourself and your partner about your mistakes.\n2. **Show, don't tell**: Instead of saying \"I love you,\" show your gratitude and love through actions. Small gestures can go a long way. For example, surprise her with her favorite meal, plan a weekend getaway, or write her a heartfelt letter expressing your appreciation.\n3. **Be genuine, not pretentious**: You mentioned you're not a \"romantic guy\" and find lovey-dovey stuff awkward. That's okay! Be authentic and find ways to express your feelings that feel natural to you. It's the thought that counts, not the grand gestures.\n4. **Communicate openly**: Have an honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings, concerns, and intentions.

Be consistent in your words and actions, and make a conscious effort to prioritize her needs and feelings.\n6. **Focus on the present, not the future**: Instead of worrying about proposing or being financially secure, focus on making the present moment special. Show your girlfriend you're committed to her and your relationship by being present, attentive, and supportive.\n7. **Small steps, big impact**: Start small by making small changes in your daily interactions. Hold hands, give her surprise hugs, or leave sweet notes.

I first learned to love myself for the person that I am around the age of 24, then after I became really comfortable in my own skin.  I deleted my Facebook (age 25) after I developed a narcissistic attitude about it, but it alleviated all of the pressure to be accepted, because it showed me who true friends were when I would invite people to events over the phone or through mail.  I am 28 years old now and I am happier than I ever been because that pressure of being accepted has been lifted as a result of my change in mindset and an attitude adjustment on my part.\n\nI hope this helps, but the key thing is to take what the others below mentioned: Accept and love yourself, surround yourself with constructive folks, become numb to societies pressures and cut BS out of your life.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get what you're saying. It's like you're caught in this cycle of seeking validation from others, and it's affecting your relationships and your own self-worth. Breaking free from that can be tough, but it's definitely possible.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's okay to have a desire to be liked and accepted by others. It's a natural human need. But when it starts to control your actions and decisions, that's when it becomes a problem.\n\nTo change your mindset, I'd suggest starting by recognizing that social status is just an illusion. It's a construct created by society to create a sense of hierarchy. In reality, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's not a competition.\n\nNext, think about what you're actually getting out of those popular friend group hangouts. Is it true fulfillment and connection, or is it just a fleeting sense of validation? Be honest with yourself. If it's the latter, it might be worth re-evaluating those relationships.\n\nNow, about those unpopular geeks you're ignoring – I'm not saying you should suddenly start hanging out with them just to prove a point. But what if you approached them with an open mind and a willingness to connect on a genuine level? You might be surprised by the common interests or shared values you discover.\n\nHere's a thought experiment: Imagine you're not worried about what others think of you. You're just focusing on building meaningful relationships and having fun. How would you approach social situations differently? What kind of conversations would you have? Who would you want to spend time with?\n\nLastly, remember that you can't control how others perceive you, but you can control how you show up in the world. Focus on being your authentic self, and the right people will be drawn to that.\n\nIt's a process, and it takes time, but with self-reflection and a willingness to challenge your own biases, you can develop a more authentic and fulfilling social approach."

    "base_reply": "The old \"listening trap\"! It's a common issue, especially when anxiety is involved. Here's a simple yet effective technique to help you focus on what the other person is saying:\n\n**Practice active listening with a twist**: When the other person starts speaking, make a conscious effort to:\n\n1. **Set aside your response**: Put your own thoughts and reactions on pause. It's okay to not have an immediate response. You're not a robot, after all!\n2. **Give the speaker your undivided attention**: Maintain eye contact, face the person, and avoid distractions like your phone or surroundings.\n3. **Use verbal cues**: Show you're engaged by nodding, making brief comments like \"uh-huh\" or \"I see,\" or asking open-ended questions that encourage the speaker to continue.\n4. **Paraphrase and summarize**: Repeat back what you've heard in your own words. This helps you clarify your understanding and shows the speaker you're actively listening. For example, \"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying...?\"\n5. **Avoid mental preparation of your response**: Instead, focus on truly hearing what the other person is saying. Avoid mentally rehearsing your response or thinking about what you'll say next.\n\nWhen you're anxious, it's even more crucial to focus on the present moment and the person speaking. Try to:\n\n* Take a few deep breaths before the conversation to calm your nerves\n* Use a physical anchor, like a gentle touch on your arm or a small object, to help ground yourself\n* Practice mindfulness meditation or relaxation techniques to improve your ability to focus on the present\n\nRemember, active listening is a skill that takes practice, especially when you're anxious. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you struggle at first. With time and effort, you'll become more comfortable focusing on what others are saying, and your conversations will become more meaningful and productive."

Either way, it's not a great experience to have, and you deserve to be treated fairly.\n\nBefore returning, you might want to consider calling the shop to report the issue and see how they handle it. If they're willing to make it right, that could be a good sign. However, if they're not cooperative or dismissive, it's probably best to avoid them.\n\nIn general, it's always a good idea to be mindful of your interactions with business owners and vendors.

Your time and money are valuable, and you should prioritize your own well-being.\n\nSo, for now, it might be best to explore other options for your smoking needs.

Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit. I can't even remember the last time that I slept for more than seven hours in a single night. It's probably been around two months now. I wish that I could stop, but I don't really have a reason to at the same time. I don't have a girlfriend to make love with or anything. \n\nSo, how can I stop?

    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're recognizing the impact of your behavior on your overall well-being. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge a problem and seek help. I'm here to provide you with guidance and support.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that overcoming an addiction like this requires a comprehensive approach. It's not just about willpower or quitting cold turkey. You'll need to address the underlying factors contributing to your behavior and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nGiven your situation, it's crucial to establish a consistent sleep schedule. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help regulate your body and mind. This will likely require you to adjust your daily routine, which may involve waking up earlier or going to bed earlier.\n\nNext, it's vital to find alternative activities to replace your excessive masturbation. This could include:\n\n1. Exercise: Engage in physical activities that bring you joy, such as yoga, jogging, or weightlifting. Exercise can help reduce stress and improve your mood.\n2. Hobbies: Explore new hobbies or revive old ones that you enjoyed before your addiction took hold. This could be reading, playing an instrument, or painting.\n3. Social connections: Reach out to friends or family members you haven't spoken to in a while. Building social connections can help you feel more fulfilled and less isolated.\n4. Personal growth: Focus on self-improvement by learning a new skill, practicing mindfulness, or setting personal goals.\n5. Creative expression: Write, draw, or create music as a way to express yourself and channel your emotions.\n\nIt's also crucial to address the emotional aspects of your addiction. Porn and masturbation can be a coping mechanism for underlying issues such as stress, anxiety, or feelings of loneliness. Consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor to explore these underlying issues and develop healthier coping strategies.\n\nAdditionally, consider implementing a \"no-porn\" policy for a set period, such as 30 days, to help you break the habit and reduce your dependence on it. You can also try apps or software that help you track and limit your screen time or block access to explicit content.\n\nRemember, quitting an addiction is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Celebrate your small victories, and use them as motivation to keep moving forward.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or support group for accountability and encouragement. Having a support system can make a significant difference in your journey towards recovery.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and you can overcome this addiction."

    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It's like you're stuck in a vicious cycle of self-doubt and procrastination. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and tired. It's normal to feel that way, especially when you're carrying a heavy mental load. But here's the thing: you can't change your circumstances by avoiding them. You need to tackle that messy apartment and those emails, no matter how daunting they seem.\n\nTo get started, try the \"2-minute rule.\" Set a timer for 2 minutes and challenge yourself to take one small step towards cleaning your apartment. It could be as simple as picking up one item of clothing or wiping down the kitchen counter. Once that 2 minutes is up, take a short break, and then come back to it. You can keep doing this until you've made some progress.\n\nAs for the emails, try breaking it down into smaller tasks. Instead of feeling like you need to write a perfect, polished email, focus on just sending a simple introduction or inquiry. You can always refine it later. Remember, the goal is to take action, not to create a masterpiece.\n\nNow, about your self-doubt in your career. It's natural to feel uncertain about your work, especially when you're trying to break into a competitive field. But here's the thing: nobody starts out as a pro. Even the most successful artists and creatives had to start somewhere. And you know what? They probably felt just as uncertain and self-doubting as you do.\n\nTo build your confidence, try focusing on small, achievable goals. Instead of thinking about the big picture, focus on the next step. What's the smallest, most manageable task you can take towards your goals? Take that step, and then celebrate your success. Repeat this process, and you'll start to build momentum.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Don't beat yourself up over things that haven't worked out or things you think are \"wrong\" with your work. Instead, focus on what you can control, and take things one step at a time.\n\nLastly, I want to challenge your self-defeating thoughts. When you catch yourself thinking \"I'll never get it as nice as I want,\" or \"My work is crap,\" try to reframe those thoughts. Tell yourself, \"I'll do my best with what I have right now,\" or \"I'll learn and grow from this experience.\" You got this!"

Later in the day she texted me asking about what my plans were for tonight, and I told her I'm free to hang out online, and that I'll be going out with some friends that I haven't seen for a long time later tn. She then texted me saying that she thought we were gonna hang out together all night. I was really confused since she cancelled our plans that day. I called her immediately to clear things up, but she didn't pick up.

Then she basically acknowledged that I didn't actually know she needed me, but strongly implied that now that I do know, I needed to cancel these plans with my friends and be with her. I told her I can't because I haven't seen these people in months, some of them a year, and that I was only gonna be with them for dinner, and then I'll be back. It was literally the only chance I had for a get together with these friends for a while. She then told me that while I was allowed to go out with my friends,  she was disappointed that I prioritized going out with them over her needs, and that this is the one night when she needed me.

We had a pretty drama-free growing up and everyone is pretty well adjusted, me, my two brothers (33 M and 34 M), and my sister (29 F). I saw my parents' marriage as a decent model for what I wanted mine to be like. They were caring and loving and kind to each other and they gave each other little kindnesses that I didn't even realize when I was a kid but now make me really appreciate how good they were to each other.

It's completely understandable that you're struggling with these feelings, and I'm here to help you process them.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, even if they seem irrational or unjustified. Your mom was an incredible person, and it's natural to feel like you're still grieving her loss. It's also normal to feel a sense of loss and displacement when someone you love moves on with their life, especially when it's to someone who wasn't part of your family.\n\nRegarding your dad's relationship with his new wife, it's clear that he's genuinely happy and fulfilled.

Acknowledge and validate your emotions: It's okay to feel angry, hurt, or confused. Recognize that these feelings are a normal part of the grieving process and that you're not alone.\n2. Practice self-care: Take time for yourself to reflect on your emotions, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize your well-being.\n3. Communicate with your dad: When you feel ready, have an open and honest conversation with your dad about your feelings. Be specific about what's bothering you, and try to avoid blaming or attacking him. Use \"I\" statements to express your emotions and avoid accusatory language.\n4. Focus on your own relationships: Instead of comparing your family to your dad's new relationship, focus on nurturing your own relationships with your siblings and other loved ones.\n5. Create new memories: Find ways to create new memories with your dad, even if it's not the same as the memories you shared with your mom. This can help you move forward and create a sense of closure.\n\nRemember, grief is a process, and it's okay to take your time. You don't have to resolve your feelings immediately. With patience, self-care, and open communication, you can work through these emotions and maintain a healthy relationship with your dad."

    "sentence": "continuing to wfh after covid This is something many of us will face. Many companies have provided wfh spaces successfully but will attempt to reintegrate employees to the office. What wording are you using to avoid this? \n\nThe wording I’ve thought of:\n“I’m not open to doing that”\n\nBasically, I do not want to negotiate going back in...even for additional salary and benefits - nothing will replace having lunch with my children and those 10 hours a week not commuting. I do not want to be confrontational or long winded but don’t feel the need to explain WHY to my company. I am prepared to ultimately quit if necessary. I want to use my ability to quit in order to help change the culture (whether that’s me eventually throwing that card out there or just being able to stand firmly without fear)...hopefully me standing my ground will help those without the option to. \n\nI am open to coming into the office max once a month and with at least a week’s notice prior (no “come into the office tomorrow” games bc I deserve to not be ping ponged)\n\nMy personal situation at work has historically been flexible and accommodating...however I do not know how much pressure for returning will rain down from investors or upper senior management. Also, I hope this thread will help people in a variety of situations other than my own",
    "human": "My position was WFH full time prior to covid so nothing really will change for me. It just so happens that my prior position was in the office and I was resisting going WFH until my office space was closed completely during WFH, and as I thought, I fucking hate it. I used to like getting home from work since it was my refuge, now there is no delineation in my day any more and it fucking sucks.",
    "base_reply": "I love your straightforward approach! You're right, being direct and clear can be the most effective way to communicate your boundaries. Here are some alternative wordings that might help you convey your message without being confrontational:\n\n1. \"I'm not comfortable with a full-time return to the office at this time.\"\n2. \"I've grown accustomed to my current work-from-home setup and would like to continue it.\"\n3. \"I'm happy to discuss alternative arrangements, but I'm not open to a full-time return to the office.\"\n4. \"I've found a great work-life balance with my current arrangement and would like to maintain it.\"\n5. \"I'm willing to revisit our office schedule, but I need more notice and a clear understanding of the expectations.\"\n\nThese phrases acknowledge your employer's request while still conveying your boundaries. Remember, you're not obligated to justify your reasons for wanting to continue working from home. Your personal circumstances are your own, and it's okay to prioritize your needs.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about using your situation to help others who might be in similar circumstances. By being open about your boundaries, you can create a ripple effect and encourage others to advocate for themselves as well.\n\nAs you prepare for potential pushback, it's essential to remember that you're not alone. Many people have successfully negotiated flexible work arrangements, and there are resources available to support you. If you do need to have a more in-depth conversation with your employer, consider seeking guidance from HR or a professional organization that advocates for remote work."

The difference between good and great is usually small. A pro baseball player fails 7 out of ten times in hitting and makes the All-star team. The same player fails 8 in ten and he will be looking for a job. \nThe KEY is to keep trying, over and over. Have no memory of past negative results, they are just part of the process.

    "base_reply": "Rejection can be tough to deal with, and it's common to feel deflated or demotivated after a rejection. Here are some tips that might help you handle rejection better, both in job interviews and dating:\n\n1. **Don't take it personally**: Remember that rejection is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's often a decision based on factors outside of your control, such as the company's needs, the interviewer's mood, or the competition.\n\nFor job interviews: Focus on the skills and qualifications you bring to the table, and try not to internalize the rejection.\n\nFor dating: Try to separate your self-worth from the rejection. You are more than your dating life, and it doesn't define your value as a person.\n\n2. **Practice self-care**: Take time to recharge and focus on your well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, exercise, meditate, or connect with friends and family.\n\n3. **Learn from the experience**: Use rejection as an opportunity to learn and grow. Ask for feedback, if possible, and identify areas for improvement.\n\nFor job interviews: Ask the interviewer for feedback, and use it to refine your approach for future interviews.\n\nFor dating: Reflect on what didn't work out and what you could do differently in the future.\n\n4. **Don't give up**: Rejection is a normal part of the process. Don't let it discourage you from continuing to pursue your goals.\n\nFor job interviews: Keep applying, and don't get discouraged if it takes a while to find the right fit.\n\nFor dating: Don't give up on dating altogether. Keep putting yourself out there, and don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out.\n\n5. **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, focus on what you can control, such as your preparation, attitude, and effort.\n\nFor job interviews: Focus on preparing well for the next interview, and try to stay positive and confident.\n\nFor dating: Focus on being your authentic self, being open-minded, and putting your best foot forward.\n\nRemember, rejection is a natural part of life, and it's not a reflection of your worth. By practicing self-care, learning from the experience, and staying positive, you can bounce back from rejection and continue to move forward."

    "human": "Make sure you have enough pictures (at least 5). They must be good quality and not dark/blurry. At least one or two should be body shots, so not just selfies. Have pictures that tell something about you : travelling, doing a hobby, whatever. That can help a lot.",
    "base_reply": "I'm happy to help you with that! It can be frustrating and demotivating when you're not getting matches with people you're interested in on Tinder.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the possible reasons why this might be happening:\n\n1. **Your profile might not be showcasing your best self**: Take a step back and re-evaluate your profile. Is your profile photo a good representation of who you are? Are you showcasing your personality, interests, and values? Make sure your profile is authentic and highlights your unique qualities.\n2. **Your matches might be getting lost in the noise**: With so many people on Tinder, it's easy for matches to get lost in the sea of profiles. Try to stand out by adding a personal touch to your profile, such as a unique bio or a fun fact about yourself.\n3. **Your swipe game might need improvement**: Be honest with yourself - are you swiping based on superficial qualities like physical appearance, or are you taking the time to read people's profiles and find common interests? Try to swipe based on more substantial qualities, like shared values and interests.\n4. **You might be looking for someone who's out of your league**: Let's face it - we all have our own standards, and it's okay to have high expectations. However, if you're consistently swiping left on people who are genuinely interested in you, it might be worth re-evaluating your standards and being more open to people who share similar qualities and interests.\n\nTo improve your chances of getting matches with people you're interested in, try the following:\n\n1. **Be more specific in your preferences**: Instead of swiping on people based on physical appearance, try to find people who share similar interests, values, or hobbies.\n2. **Take the time to read profiles**: Don't just swipe left or right based on a quick glance. Take the time to read people's profiles, learn about their interests, and find common ground.\n3. **Be authentic and genuine**: Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. People can usually tell when you're being insincere, and it's a major turn-off.\n4. **Don't get discouraged**: It's okay if you don't get matches right away. Keep swiping, keep being yourself, and eventually, you'll find someone who resonates with you.\n\nRemember, Tinder is just a platform - it's not a guarantee of success. Focus on building meaningful connections with people who share your values and interests, and don't get too hung up on the number of matches you get. Good luck!"

The problem is with my mental state; I want to sacrifice my life to save someone/people and die satisfied. I've been thinking this way for years and I just can't find anything else that makes me happy. The engineering major was pushed onto me by my parents due to job prospects and I'm not doing so well in academics due to my disinterest in this major; this led to me having no motivation to apply for any jobs even though I'm graduating in a month, with no internship or experience due to depression.\n\nMay be I should stop watching movies/shows that have these types of situations?

It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the idea that you want to sacrifice your life to save someone/people and die satisfied. This might be a coping mechanism or a way to deal with feelings of guilt, anxiety, or a sense of purposelessness. It's important to recognize that this thought pattern might not be a realistic or healthy goal. Sacrificing your own well-being for others can lead to burnout, resentment, and a lack of fulfillment.\n\nAs for your interest in engineering, it's understandable that you feel trapped by your parents' expectations. It's essential to take a step back and assess what you truly want to do with your life. You might not have to stick with the major just because of your parents' wishes. Consider exploring other options, even if it means taking a gap year or switching majors.\n\nRegarding your depression and lack of motivation, it's crucial to prioritize your mental health. I'm not saying you should stop watching movies/shows that have themes of self-sacrifice (although it might be worth taking a break from them), but rather, let's focus on building your self-awareness and self-care.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. You're struggling, and that's a normal part of life.\n2. Explore your values and interests: Take some time to reflect on what truly matters to you, what makes you happy, and what you're passionate about. This might help you find a new direction or rekindle your interest in engineering.\n3. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. Sharing your struggles with someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood.\n4. Take small steps: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the thought of finding a new career path or overcoming depression, focus on taking small, achievable steps towards positive change. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy.\n\nRemember, you're not alone, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out. You're 24, and it's normal to still be exploring your identity and interests. Focus on building a strong foundation for your mental health, and the rest will follow.\n\nLastly, I want to reassure you that it's not wrong to want to help others or make a positive impact. However, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and find ways to contribute to others that don't compromise your own happiness and fulfillment."

Sharing your feelings and concerns with someone you trust can help you gain a new perspective and feel less isolated.\n\nRemember, your feelings are valid, and it's okay to take time to navigate this complex situation.

This might mean setting specific deadlines, delegating tasks, or establishing a clear chain of command. This way, you can relax knowing that things are under control.\n2. **Prepare in advance**: Try to wrap up as many tasks as possible before you leave.

This can help you truly disconnect and recharge.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some experimentation to find what works for you. But with time and practice, you can learn to relax on vacation and enjoy your time off.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything that resonates with you, or is there something else you'd like to add?"

If I had any that he was uncomfortable with or felt that he couldn’t help me fulfill, he’d allow me to explore that with someone else and hoped that I’d allow him to do the same. Ngl, I have been thinking about it. It turns me on but also makes me upset. I do think if we were to do this, it would change me, us, and my feelings for him would. So I decided it’s not for me. I’d prefer for him not to do it, but it seemed like it was important for him to experience once so I’d like for him to explore that. He’s also expressed that over time, his feelings for me could grow past his desire for this. If he is to do this, I think we should hold off on exclusivity for a bit. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nTLDR \nGuy I’ve seeing is open to exclusivity but wants to have a threesome once to fulfill his sexual fantasy. He doesn’t want to cut someone off that he’s been seeing in the past who is willing. He’s asked if I am willing, but if I am not, he’s hoping I’d allow him to explore that with someone else. What are your thoughts on this situation?",
    "human": "The *vast*, and I mean **VAST** majority of people in committed, monogamous relationships *do not* have the emotional maturity for a threesome... it almost always ends in hurt feelings and a breakup.\n\nThreesomes are wonderful as fantasies, even as real experiences - usually best enjoyed outside the bounds of a relationship.",
    "base_reply": "Wow, this is a lot to unpack! I'm glad you're taking the time to think critically about this situation. It's completely reasonable to feel upset and unsure about this, and I'm here to help you break it down.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're having open and honest conversations about your feelings and boundaries. It's essential in any relationship. It's also commendable that you're considering his feelings and desires, even if they differ from yours.\n\nHere are some thoughts to consider:\n\n1. **Consent and communication**: It's crucial to prioritize open communication and enthusiastic consent in any sexual encounter. If you're not comfortable with the idea of a threesome, it's essential to express that clearly and assertively. Similarly, if you're not comfortable with him exploring this with someone else, you should communicate that as well.\n2. **Your feelings and boundaries**: It's understandable that you're feeling upset about the idea of a threesome, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being. You should consider whether this is something you're willing to compromise on or if it's a non-negotiable for you.\n3. **Exclusivity**: You're right to suggest holding off on exclusivity for a bit if he does decide to pursue this. It's essential to establish a foundation of trust, respect, and open communication before making a commitment.\n4. **His feelings and desires**: It's essential to understand that his desire for a threesome is a significant aspect of his sexual identity and desires. You should consider whether you're comfortable with exploring this aspect of his sexuality, even if it's not something you're interested in yourself.\n5. **Your growth and boundaries**: You mentioned that this situation would change you and your feelings for him. It's essential to prioritize your own personal growth and boundaries. If you're not comfortable with the idea of a threesome, it's crucial to communicate that clearly and assertively.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. It's essential to prioritize your own feelings, boundaries, and desires. If you're not comfortable with the idea of a threesome, it's okay to express that and establish boundaries. If you're willing to explore this aspect of his sexuality, it's essential to prioritize open communication and enthusiastic consent.\n\nRemember, honesty and open communication are key in any relationship. Take the time to discuss this further with your partner, and make sure you're both on the same page."

    "sentence": "How to deal with nosy people? With the holiday season coming up, I am wondering on how I can improve answering questions without revealing things that I don't want others to know?",
    "human": "try to change the subject or try to stall and make them forget the subject e.g. get distracted by a pet or going to the toilet",
    "base_reply": "Dealing with nosy people can be challenging, especially during the holiday season when social gatherings and conversations can be more frequent. Here are some tips to help you navigate these situations:\n\n1. **Practice the art of gentle deflection**: When someone asks a question that's too personal or you'd rather not answer, try saying something like, \"That's a great question, but I'd rather not share that right now.\" or \"I'd rather keep that private, if you don't mind.\" This approach is polite and sets boundaries without being confrontational.\n2. **Use the \"honey, I'd rather not talk about that\" approach**: When someone asks a question you're not comfortable answering, you can say, \"Honey, I'd rather not talk about that right now. Let's focus on something else.\" This response acknowledges their interest while politely steering the conversation in a different direction.\n3. **Keep your answers brief and vague**: If you do choose to answer a question, try to keep your response brief and vague. For example, if someone asks about your personal life, you could say, \"Things are going well, thanks for asking. How about you?\" This approach gives a general update without revealing too much.\n4. **Use humor to diffuse tension**: If someone is being overly nosy or persistent, you can use humor to lighten the mood and shift the focus away from their question. For example, you could say, \"I'm not sure I'm ready for my 15 minutes of fame just yet!\"\n5. **Set boundaries and be consistent**: It's essential to establish and maintain boundaries with nosy people. Be clear and direct when communicating your limits, and be consistent in enforcing those boundaries. If someone consistently disrespects your boundaries, it may be necessary to reevaluate the relationship.\n6. **Practice assertive body language**: Nonverbal cues can be just as important as verbal ones when dealing with nosy people. Make sure to maintain eye contact, use open and confident body language, and avoid crossing your arms or legs, which can give the impression of defensiveness.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and privacy. Don't feel obligated to share information you're not comfortable sharing. By using these strategies, you can navigate conversations with nosy people while maintaining your personal boundaries and dignity."

I do not wish to discuss politics with them whatsoever, but they feel the need to try to \"convert\" me to their way of thinking. I've tried to rationally defend my views, or at least to change the subject when they bring up politics, but they are relentless. I'm dreading another painful holiday dinner listening to their craziness...any tips for how to handle this situation gracefully?",
    "human": "I had the same issue and 'solved' it with unresponsiveness when approached with the subject. They did not care for my explanation of \"I simply don't want to discuss this with you.\"",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it! It can be super frustrating and stressful to navigate these kinds of conversations, especially when they feel like a personal attack or an attempt to \"convert\" you. Here's a strategy that might help:\n\n1. **Set boundaries early**: Before the holiday dinner, consider having a gentle conversation with your relatives about your boundaries. You can say something like, \"Hey, I know we have different political views, and I value our relationship. I'd love to focus on other topics during our time together, like [insert shared interest or hobby]. Can we agree to keep politics off the table?\" This sets the tone for the conversation and gives them a heads-up that you're not up for a debate.\n2. **Practice active listening (without engaging)**: When they start bringing up politics, listen attentively to what they're saying, but don't feel obligated to respond. Acknowledge their perspective with a nod or a brief comment like, \"I understand where you're coming from.\" This shows you're willing to hear them out without taking the bait.\n3. **Use \"gray rock\" technique: Gray rock is a term used to describe remaining neutral and unresponsive, like a gray rock in a river – the water flows around it without affecting it. When they try to engage you in a debate, simply respond with a non-committal statement like, \"I understand we have different opinions\" or \"I'm not comfortable discussing this topic.\" Avoid getting drawn into an argument or trying to \"win\" the debate.\n4. **Change the subject (but not abruptly)**: When you feel like the conversation is getting too heated or uncomfortable, try to steer the conversation towards a different topic. You can say something like, \"Speaking of [related topic], have you heard about [new development]?\" or \"I've been meaning to ask you about [shared interest].\"\n5. **Avoid taking the bait**: Remember that their goal is often to get a rise out of you. Don't take the bait by getting defensive, emotional, or aggressive. Stay calm, composed, and respectful, even if you're feeling frustrated. This will help de-escalate the situation and prevent it from becoming a full-blown argument.\n6. **Practice empathy and understanding**: Try to see things from their perspective and understand where they're coming from. Acknowledge that everyone has the right to their opinions, even if you disagree. This doesn't mean you have to agree with them, but it can help diffuse tension and create a more positive atmosphere.\n7. **Prepare for the possibility they won't respect your boundaries**: Unfortunately, some people might not respect your boundaries or try to push you to engage in a discussion. In this case, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take a break from the conversation if necessary. You can say something like, \"I understand we have different views, and I'd rather not discuss this further. Let's focus on [other topic].\"\n\nRemember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. By setting boundaries, practicing active listening, and staying calm, you can navigate these conversations with more ease and maintain a positive relationship with your relatives."

Instead of focusing on what they said, focus on the issue at hand. For example, \"I'm concerned about [specific issue], and I think [your point].

When we first moved into the house, we had a verbal agreement that neither of our girlfriends would stay over more than once or twice a week. \n\nThat was before he got her a job with us. Now, she's staying anywhere from 4-5 days a week.\n\nNow, I don't have any problems with her, or just the fact that she's here. It's the fact she's showering here, using the other utilities, not always cleaning up after herself (or him for that matter), etc. \n\nTo make the situation worse, I didn't realize before we moved in that my roommate is bipolar. He has really bad mood swings, and quite a bad temper sometimes. For example, I asked him to move his car out of the way since it was blocking mine in the garage.

I'll offer some suggestions, but please keep in mind that everyone's experiences with bipolar disorder are unique, and it's essential to be patient, understanding, and empathetic.\n\nBefore talking to your roommate, take a few moments to gather your thoughts and emotions. It's essential to approach the conversation calmly and objectively. You might want to jot down some notes about the specific issues you've been experiencing, like the frequency of his girlfriend's visits, the lack of cleanliness, and the impact on your daily life.\n\nWhen you're ready to talk to your roommate, choose a private setting where you both feel comfortable. Start by expressing your appreciation for his girlfriend and acknowledging that you're not opposed to her visiting occasionally. However, you need to discuss the concerns you have about the frequency and impact on your living situation.\n\nBe specific about the issues you've been experiencing, using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example:\n\n\"I've noticed that his girlfriend has been staying over more frequently than our original agreement, and it's affecting my ability to have some quiet time in my own space. I'm also concerned about the extra utilities and mess that comes with it. I understand that she's part of your life, but I need some boundaries to maintain my own well-being.\"\n\nRegarding his bipolar disorder, it's essential to approach this topic with sensitivity. You might say something like:\n\n\"I want to acknowledge that I'm aware of your bipolar diagnosis, and I'm here to support you. However, I've noticed that your mood swings can sometimes affect our communication. I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that respects your needs while also addressing my concerns.\"\n\nWhen discussing the car incident, it's crucial to focus on the specific behavior rather than attacking his personality or condition. You might say:\n\n\"I felt disrespected when you reacted strongly to my request about the car. I understand that we all have bad days, but I need you to understand that we need to work together to maintain a harmonious living environment. Can we find a way to communicate more effectively in the future?\"\n\nRemember to listen actively to your roommate's perspective and be open to finding a compromise. It's possible that he's not aware of the impact his girlfriend's visits are having on you, and he may be willing to work with you to find a solution.\n\nLastly, consider setting some ground rules for future conversations. You might say:\n\n\"Going forward, I'd like to establish a clear understanding about how we communicate about issues like this. Can we agree to stay calm and respectful, and work together to find a solution?\"\n\nBy approaching the conversation with empathy, specificity, and a solution-focused mindset, you'll be more likely to find a resolution that works for both of you."

I searched high and low through my house, and boyfriend told me he'd searched everywhere in his. So we bought another one the same. Last night I was at his house, and opened the camping supplies cupboards searching for something else. Lo and behold there is a lilo on top and very easy to see in both cupboards. I exclaimed 'look there's both our lilos'. At first he thought one was just the box, but then agreed with me that there were two when I pointed it out. \n\nI waited til his housemates had left us, and then said 'can you see why I would be frustrated that the original lilo was in there? He said no he couldn't, as it was a very small issue from 6 months ago, and also it is possible that one of his housemates may have borrowed it and just put it back there. I said I just wanted him to say he understood why I was frustrated, and acknowledge that there was a chance he'd made a mistake, but he said I need to let things go and process my emotions around little things like this alone, rather than making everything into a huge issue and bringing him into it.\n\n In the end, he was really upset and kept asking me why I couldn't just admit that I was wrong to bring up such a small thing and apologise for making our night focussed on a negative thing. I apologised and admitted I was wrong. But I cantthelp thinking perhaps he could have apologised. Am I wrong to bring up things like this in a relationship? I apologised because I know it is really frustrating for him when I bring up small issues, and to be honest I wasn't actually hugely annoyed.

It's natural to feel frustrated when you're not heard or validated in a relationship. However, it's also important to recognize that your partner's difficulty in taking accountability might not be about you or your feelings, but rather a deeper issue that he needs to work on.\n\nRather than pushing him to validate your feelings or admit to mistakes, I would suggest focusing on how you can communicate your needs and boundaries more effectively. Since you mentioned that you know it's frustrating for him when you bring up small issues, perhaps you could try framing your concerns in a more specific and solution-focused way. For example, instead of saying \"you didn't take responsibility for your mistake,\" you could say \"I feel frustrated when I bring up an issue and you dismiss it as'small.'

It's a natural response to uncertainty and the fear of being judged. But, since you're aware of it, we can work on building some strategies to help you shift into a more comfortable mode.\n\nHere are a few mindset shifts and tips that might help:\n\n1. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of thinking \"They're judging me,\" try to focus on \"I'm getting to know someone new.\" This simple shift can help you relax and approach the interaction as an opportunity to learn more about the other person, rather than worrying about how they perceive you.\n2. **Practice mindfulness**: Take a few deep breaths before engaging with the new person. This can help calm your nervous system and give you a clearer headspace. You can also try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about what might happen in the future or past.\n3. **Find common ground**: Try to find something you both have in common, whether it's a shared interest, a hobby, or a favorite movie. This can help you build a connection and make the conversation feel more natural.\n4. **Use positive self-talk**: Instead of beating yourself up over your stuttering or awkwardness, remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. Tell yourself, \"I'm doing the best I can,\" or \"I'm learning and growing.\" This can help you stay calm and focused.\n5. **Focus on listening**: Instead of worrying about what you're saying, try to focus on listening to the other person. Ask open-ended questions and show genuine interest in what they have to say. This can help take the spotlight off yourself and make the conversation feel more natural.\n6. **Smile and relax your body language**: When you're feeling nervous, your body can tense up, which can make you look more awkward. Try to relax your shoulders, unclench your fists, and smile. This can help you feel more at ease and others may perceive you as more approachable.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you put yourself in situations where you have to interact with new people, the more comfortable you'll become. Start small, like striking up a conversation with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. Gradually work your way up to more significant interactions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and not be perfect. It's okay to stumble over your words or make mistakes. The goal is to be yourself, be kind, and show genuine interest in others. With time and practice, you'll become more confident and comfortable in your own skin.\n\nAs for the physical symptoms like stuttering and blushing, try to focus on the sensation rather than the thought behind it. For example, when you start to stutter, try to notice the physical sensation of your tongue or lips moving, rather than the fear of what others might think. This can help you detach from the thought and focus on the present moment.\n\nLastly, remember that it's not about copying someone else's behavior, but about becoming more comfortable with yourself. You don't have to change who you are; you just need to learn to be more confident in your own skin.\n\nI hope these tips help you feel more at ease when interacting with new people!"

I have tried to get him to express himself more clearly and I honestly just feel so done when the food \"works\" or he replies that he \"can go with xx choice\" to my suggestions.

It's possible that your fiancé is not even aware of the impact his communication style is having on you, and he might be willing to work on it if you approach the conversation in a non-confrontational way.\n\nLastly, consider seeking outside help, like couples therapy, to work through these issues and develop healthier communication habits. A professional can provide a safe and neutral space for you both to explore your concerns and develop strategies for improvement.\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself for feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.

The problem is I’m on workers comp until middle of next year at the least which means I will have no taxable income and I can only contribute if I have taxable income. Is there a solution or legal loophole to this?",
    "human": "This is tax avoidance.  LPT - don’t do that.  You clearly are deriving value from a lot of things taxes fund.",
    "base_reply": "I understand your concern. Unfortunately, there isn't a straightforward loophole to contribute to a Roth IRA without taxable income. The IRS requires you to have earned income to contribute to a Roth IRA. However, there might be some alternatives to consider:\n\n1. Wait until you have taxable income: As you mentioned, you can wait until you start receiving taxable income again and then contribute the remaining amount to your Roth IRA. This might not be ideal, but it's a straightforward solution.\n2. Consider a non-deductible IRA: You can contribute to a traditional IRA, which doesn't require earned income. The contribution limits are the same as Roth IRAs ($6,000 in 2021), but the contributions are not tax-deductible. You'll need to pay taxes on the withdrawals in retirement. This option might not be as beneficial as a Roth IRA, but it's an alternative.\n3. Consider a spousal IRA: If you're married, your spouse might have earned income and can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. You can then contribute to a spousal IRA, which allows non-working spouses to contribute to an IRA. However, the contribution limits are lower ($6,000 in 2021), and there are income limits on who can deduct contributions.\n4. Consider a taxable brokerage account: You can also consider opening a taxable brokerage account and investing the $6,000. While it won't be a tax-advantaged retirement account, you'll have access to the funds and can invest in a diversified portfolio. Keep in mind that you'll need to pay taxes on any capital gains or dividends.\n5. Consult a financial advisor: It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor who can assess your individual situation and provide personalized advice. They might have other strategies or options that can help you achieve your retirement goals.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your financial situation and goals when making decisions. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider what works best for you."

Here's a step-by-step approach to help you cope with the situation:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: It's essential to establish what you're comfortable with and what you're not. When the person starts complaining, politely interrupt and say, \"I understand you're upset, but I'm not comfortable listening to this negativity. Can we focus on finding solutions or moving forward?\" Be firm but respectful.\n2. **Avoid taking it personally**: Remember that their complaining is often a reflection of their own issues, not yours. Try not to internalize their negativity or take it as a personal attack. Keep in mind that you can't control their behavior, but you can control how you respond to it.\n3. **Practice active listening (with limits)**: When the person starts complaining, listen attentively for a short period (about 2-3 minutes). Acknowledge their concerns with a nod or a brief statement, like \"I understand you're frustrated.\" Then, gently steer the conversation towards finding solutions or changing the subject.\n4. **Don't engage in arguments**: Avoid getting drawn into debates or arguments, as this can escalate the situation. Instead, focus on finding common ground or shifting the focus to a more positive topic.\n5. **Use humor (carefully)**: If you're comfortable with humor, use it to diffuse the situation. Make a lighthearted comment or joke to lighten the mood. However, be cautious not to come across as dismissive or mocking.\n6. **Set a good example**: Show the person that there's a better way to communicate by expressing gratitude, positivity, and constructive feedback. Share your own experiences and challenges, but do so in a way that's not complaining or negative.\n7. **Encourage positive self-talk**: Support the person in reframing their thoughts and focusing on the good things in their life. Encourage them to practice gratitude and mindfulness.\n8. **Seek support for yourself**: Don't underestimate the emotional toll of dealing with someone who complains excessively. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance on managing the situation.\n9. **Consider a mediated conversation**: If the complaining is severe and affecting your well-being, consider having a mediated conversation with the person. A neutral third party can help facilitate a constructive discussion and provide guidance on how to improve communication.\n10. **Know when to re-evaluate the relationship**: If the complaining is persistent and toxic, it may be necessary to re-evaluate the relationship. Prioritize your own well-being and consider setting boundaries or distancing yourself from the person if necessary.\n\nRemember that you can't change the person, but you can change how you respond to them.

It's understandable that you're looking for more affordable options. Here's a nuanced approach to help you explore cheaper medication alternatives:\n\n1. **Generic or alternative medications**: Vyvanse is a brand-name medication. You can explore generic or alternative medications that have similar effects, such as Adderall or Strattera. These medications may be more affordable, and you can discuss them with your fiancée's doctor. Keep in mind that generic medications may not be available for all conditions, and the efficacy might vary.\n2. **Patient assistance programs**: Many pharmaceutical companies offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) that can help with medication costs. These programs may provide discounted or free medication to eligible patients. You can search for PAPs on the Vyvanse website or contact the company directly to inquire about their program.\n3. **Mail-order pharmacies**: Mail-order pharmacies like CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, or Express Scripts often offer discounts, especially for chronic conditions like anxiety. They may also have a patient assistance program or discounts for certain medications.\n4. **Discount cards and coupons**: Look for discount cards or coupons specifically designed for Vyvanse or other medications. These can be found on websites like GoodRx, Blink Health, or through pharmaceutical company websites. Be cautious, though, as some discounts might come with restrictions or limitations.\n5. **Non-profit organizations**: Non-profit organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), might offer resources, support, and sometimes even medication assistance programs.\n6. **Sliding scale fees**: Some healthcare providers or community clinics offer sliding scale fees based on income or financial need. This might make medication more affordable. You can search online or ask your fiancée's doctor for recommendations.\n7. **Consider a mental health professional**: While medication can be helpful, therapy and counseling can also be effective in managing anxiety. A mental health professional can work with your fiancée to develop coping strategies and techniques to reduce symptoms.\n\nRemember to always consult with your fiancée's doctor before switching medications or trying alternative options. They can help determine the best course of treatment and ensure any changes are safe and effective.\n\nLastly, it's essential to prioritize your fiancée's mental health and well-being. If the medication is not affordable, consider seeking help from a financial counselor or a social worker to explore additional options and resources."

Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have doubts and fears. Remind yourself that everyone has them, and it's a normal part of the human experience.\n3. Challenge your negative self-talk: When you catch yourself thinking \"I shouldn't do this\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if they're really true. Replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts, such as \"I'm capable of learning and growing,\" or \"I'll do my best and see what happens.\"\n4. Focus on the present moment: Instead of worrying about the future or past, focus on what you can control in the present moment. Ask yourself what you can do right now to move closer to your goals.\n5. Celebrate small wins: Celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant. This will help you build confidence and momentum, which can help you overcome self-doubt.\n6.

Having a support system can help you stay motivated and accountable.\n\nRemember that overcoming self-doubt and self-sabotage takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't give up."

Sure there were a few specific celebrities that I liked more than other but it has never ever been this bad until recently.\n\nI discovered this twitch streamer/youtuber a few months ago. I didn’t thought much  when I first found out about him. But as I watched more and more of his content, I started to fall in love very very deeply.\n\nI’ve never been in a relationship irl. I’ve only had a few small crushes. But I literally have never liked someone irl as much as I like him. Now my standards for a significant other is very high because I want to find someone as perfect as him. I don’t think I’m going to be dating anyone soon bc of him.\n\nI’d watch his streams instead of focusing on my online classses. I’ve stalked his social media including finding his siblings Instagram account or track down any girl who’ve had interactions with him online. \n\nI’ve been daydreaming about him non stop these few months. I’d imagine him as my real boyfriend. I’d imagine him being in bed next to me, eating dinner and talking to me, giving me peck kisses when I’m attending online college classes, making out with him and even having sex with him. \n\nI think the reason why i’m way more obsessed with him compared to my previous celebrity crushes is because he feels much more like a “real person” to me. Most celebrities I’ve liked are superstars, maybe 10 years older than me and practically untouchable. Whereas this streamer is just a normal 20 year old full time college student that streams a few times a week. He likes to interact with the chats too and talks just like how normal people interact with each other. \n\nOne time he even said he doesn’t consider himself as a celebrity at all because he himself said he’s just like any other college student. That statement just made my obsession even worse. \n\nThis can’t be normal right? I don’t know what to do. I feel disgusted about how I feel towards him and I just know he’d be weirded out if there was some random girl having these kind of thoughts about him. But I can’t stop myself. I thought my feelings would eventually die off after a month or so but it’s almost been half a year. I feel so embarrassed and I hate myself.\n\nTL;DR: I’m having unhealthy, weird thoughts towards a streamer that doesn’t know who I am. Every day I’d imagine him as my boyfriend, kissing him and even having sex with him. I want to stop but I don’t know how to stop. I hate myself for being this obsessive towards a stranger.",

Somehow in your head you‘re in a relationship with a fictional character you‘re projecting on a stranger.\n\nThe man you‘re „obsessed“ with is just imagination.

However, it's also important to recognize that your feelings towards this streamer have escalated to an unhealthy level. It's not healthy to idealize someone you've never met, and it's even more concerning that you're using him as a benchmark for your standards in a partner.\n\nI want to emphasize that it's okay to have high standards, but it's also important to be realistic. You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find someone who's \"perfect\" because of your unrealistic expectations. This can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction in future relationships.\n\nAs for your actions, I understand that it's hard to stop yourself from fantasizing or daydreaming about this person. However, it's essential to recognize that these thoughts are not healthy and are affecting your daily life. You're neglecting your online classes and spending too much time thinking about someone who doesn't even know you exist.\n\nI want to encourage you to take a step back and re-evaluate your priorities. You deserve to have healthy relationships with people who know and care about you, not just a fantasy. It's time to focus on building connections with people who are real and can reciprocate your feelings.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. Take a break from his content: Give yourself some space and take a break from watching his streams and social media. This will help you detach from the fantasy and focus on your own life.\n2. Focus on your education: Get back on track with your online classes and prioritize your studies. You have a lot to offer, and you deserve to achieve your goals.\n3. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and mental health. Engage in activities that bring you joy, exercise regularly, and prioritize sleep.\n4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. They can help you work through this and provide guidance on how to move forward.\n\nRemember, you are not alone, and it's okay to feel embarrassed. It's a sign that you're taking the first step towards acknowledging and addressing your feelings."

It's like your brain is processing a never-ending stream of information, and it needs a break.\n\nHere are some strategies to help you regain focus and overcome that light-headedness:\n\n1. **Take breaks**: Take short, 10-15 minute breaks every hour to stretch, move around, and refresh your mind.

Approaching someone you like can be nerve-wracking, but with a thoughtful approach, you can increase your chances of building a genuine connection. Since you've had a brief interaction in 6th grade, you have a tiny foundation to work with. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you start:\n\n1. **Reflect on why you like her**: Take some time to think about what you genuinely appreciate about this girl. Is it her sense of humor, her kindness, or her interests? Clarifying your motivations will help you be more authentic in your approach.\n2. **Observe her interests and habits**: Try to notice what she's into, what she talks about, or what she's passionate about. This will give you common ground to discuss and show you're interested in getting to know her better.\n3. **Find a mutual activity or event**: Look for an opportunity to interact with her in a low-pressure setting, like a school event, club, or project. This can be a natural way to start a conversation without feeling too forced.\n4. **Start with a friendly comment or question**: When you do interact with her, begin with a light, friendly comment or question that shows you're paying attention to her interests. For example, \"Hey, I saw you're part of the debate team. How's it going?\" or \"I loved your presentation in class today, great job!\"\n5. **Listen actively and respond thoughtfully**: Pay attention to what she says and show you're engaged by nodding, asking follow-up questions, and sharing your own thoughts. Avoid dominating the conversation or trying to impress her with your own stories.\n6. **Keep it casual and brief**: Don't try to cram too much into the initial conversation. Keep it light and friendly, and be willing to wrap it up if the conversation starts to feel forced or awkward.\n7. **Respect her boundaries**: Remember that she's a person with her own thoughts, feelings, and priorities. If she doesn't seem interested in talking or doesn't respond, don't take it personally and respect her boundaries.\n8. **Follow up and be consistent**: If you do manage to start a conversation, make sure to follow up with her in a friendly way. This can be as simple as saying \"Hey, how was your weekend?\" or \"I saw that [related topic] and thought of our conversation.\" Consistency shows you're genuinely interested in getting to know her.\n\nRemember, building a connection takes time and effort.

It's a natural response to a stressful situation. But don't let those feelings paralyze you. Instead, try to reframe your thinking. Instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" try telling yourself \"I'm doing the best I can with what I have right now, and I'll continue to improve and learn as I go.\"\n\nRemember that everyone starts somewhere, and even the most successful people had to begin with a first step. It's not about being perfect; it's about taking small, consistent steps towards your goals.\n\nAlso, try to focus on what you can control, rather than worrying about things outside of your control. You can control how you prepare for interviews, how you present yourself, and how you follow up. Focus on those things, and let go of the things that are outside of your control.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not get the job.

It's natural to want to share your truth with someone who can understand and empathize. But before you do, take a step back and consider the potential consequences. Are you prepared for the reaction of the person you confide in? Are you sure you're ready to deal with the fallout?\n\nInstead of acting on the urge to confess, try to understand the underlying reasons behind it. What's driving your desire to share your secrets? Is it the need for validation, the hope for empathy, or something else? Once you identify the root cause, you can start working on addressing it in a more constructive way.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of confiding in someone else, try journaling about your secrets. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and release them. It might not be the same as talking to someone, but it can be a powerful way to unburden yourself.\n\nAnother approach is to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes, and that you're doing the best you can. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend in a similar situation.\n\nLastly, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your secrets and work through the emotions attached to them.\n\nRemember, you don't have to face this alone.

I’m here to support him through his visa/immigration process.  \n\nWe’ve asked a friend (technically family since she’s my husband’s step cousin’s wife) to watch our 2 cats, since we don’t have any other family or friends where we live.  We thought we could trust her since they have a cat.  She has also said before she appreciated that we watch her kids many times for free, since she said she feels more comfortable that it’s someone that you’ve known for years. We thought it would be mutual.  \n\nShe agreed to the drop in schedule and we thought it would be fair to pay her what the market rate is for cat sitting in the area.  We have cameras in our apartment entrance and know she hasn’t followed through with the schedule.  My husband messaged her saying if it’s an inconvenience or if it interferes with her schedule then to let us know and we could make other arrangements.  She said it’s not an issue but every 3 days would be better, so we said fine.  Yesterday, was the day she was supposed to drop in and she didn’t go.  We messaged her and she said something came up and that she arranged for her husband to go (but he didn’t).  She said that she’ll go today. I just feel hurt because also we found out yesterday my husband might be here longer than we thought.  We haven’t told her this and my husband said I should go back when it hits a month of being here, since we can’t trust her.

However, it seems like your friend didn't reciprocate that effort.\n\nConsidering your friend's behavior, it's reasonable to reevaluate the mutual arrangement you had with her. Watching her kids for free was a favor you did for her, and now that she's not holding up her end of the bargain, it's okay to reexamine the terms of your relationship.\n\nAs for whether you should still watch her kids when you go back, I'd suggest having an open and honest conversation with your husband about it. You both have the right to prioritize your own needs and well-being. If you feel that watching her kids again would be too stressful or would compromise your own situation, it's okay to set boundaries. You can explain to her that you're going through a challenging time with your husband's visa process and need to focus on your own priorities.\n\nRegarding the friendship, it's natural to feel hurt and disappointed. However, it's essential to remember that people's behavior is often a reflection of themselves, not necessarily a personal attack on you. You can still maintain a cordial relationship with your friend, but it's okay to take a step back and reevaluate the depth of your connection.\n\nIn the future, it's crucial to set clear boundaries and expectations in any arrangement, whether personal or professional. It's also essential to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if it means making tough decisions.\n\nRemember, you can't control others' behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. Take care of yourself during this challenging time, and prioritize your own well-being."

We've been sleeping together since the first date and have hung out at least once a week. \n\n\nSeveral days ago I found out Ashley [25F], a friend of mine, has also been seeing him. They started talking 4 wks ago (2 wks into me seeing him). They went on a date 2 wks ago (4 wks into me seeing him). They had plans last week but Ashley had to cancel. Adam has been very straightforward about wanting to sleep with her during their texts/talks. His date plans with her mirror my experiences.\n\n\nAdam and I did not have a conversation about exclusivity. Technically he did nothing wrong by hooking up with her but the fact that he used the same formula on her as me bothers me. I don't like that I was the backup option for the day she couldn't make it. Especially since by that point we'd been on dates without hooking up and have had conversations that I wouldn't do with a random fling.\n\n\nAshley and I hung out in a couple days ago in a group setting when the whole Adam ordeal came to light. I texted him as soon as I learned about it. The next day Ashley and I met and had a healthy one on one conversation about the situation where she disclosed everything, despite his ask not to. We decided it would be best for both of us to step back - her, because I was developing feelings for him, and me, because I was uncomfortable about things. \n\n\nAfter he'd gotten texts from each of us he confessed to Ashley and me that he'd liked me for a while and wanted to pursue more but was waiting until I was ready and would delete dating apps if I asked. He said he was planning to have a discussion about exclusivity the next time we met. \n\n\nI'm not sure how I should approach this. His interactions with Ashley led me to believe he was only interested in something casual. If it weren't a close friend I might be more objective about the situation but with how things have unfolded I'm not sure. Is initiating &amp; pursuing a sexual relationship with another person while in the beginning stages of non-exclusively dating someone you like a red flag? Should I try dating him or commit to backing off? \n\n*EDIT 1 : yes it was safe sex. I get tested regularly as does he. I confirmed this before doing anything. I wasn't expecting exclusivity and also dated around for the first few weeks we saw each other (all were casual and didn't end with anything intimate). I would be less bothered by things if I didn't know the finer details, if it wasn't my friend, or if he responded to our texts in a way that reflected his actions of dating casually.*\n\n*EDIT 2 : I've gotten a lot of comments criticizing him for not being exclusive. That's not a deal breaker for me, but what bothers me most is his response to being \"caught\". Especially since he's 10 years older than me. Thanks for helping me clarify my feelings, I really appreciate it. Definetly has saved me from future pain.*\n\n*I'm going to bow out gracefully and go out dancing with Ashley to celebrate our friendship.

It's natural to feel that way when someone you're interested in has been treating you in a way that feels uncertain and non-exclusive.\n\nNow, let's break it down. While it's true that Adam didn't technically do anything wrong by hooking up with Ashley, his actions do raise some red flags. The fact that he used the same formula on her as with you, and that he seemed to be prioritizing his desires over your feelings, is concerning. Additionally, the fact that he didn't initiate a conversation about exclusivity with you, despite getting close, suggests that he may not be invested in building a meaningful connection with you.\n\nGiven the situation, I would advise you to take a step back and re-evaluate whether you want to continue pursuing a relationship with Adam. While he's confessed to having feelings for you and is willing to discuss exclusivity, his actions have shown that he's not prioritizing your feelings or boundaries. It's essential to consider whether you're willing to continue investing time and emotions into someone who may not be fully committed to you.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your friend, Ashley, has been a source of support and understanding in this situation. It's great that you're choosing to celebrate your friendship with her and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but I would encourage you to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider whether you're willing to continue navigating this uncertain terrain with Adam."

    "base_reply": "The \"detailed storyteller\" conundrum! It can be tough to navigate, especially when the person is a good friend. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: When your friend starts telling a story, make an effort to genuinely listen and show interest. Maintain eye contact, nod your head, and ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share more. This will help them feel heard and understood.\n2. **Set gentle boundaries**: It's okay to acknowledge the length of the story and politely interrupt with a gentle \"I'm interested, but can I get back to you on that later?\" or \"That's really fascinating, can we pick it up later?\" This lets your friend know you value their story, but also need to prioritize other aspects of your interaction.\n3. **Use the \"pause-and-redirect\" technique**: When your friend starts getting too caught up in the details, pause for a brief moment, and then redirect the conversation to a different topic or ask a question that changes the subject. You can say something like, \"That's really interesting, but what do you think about [related topic]?\" or \"I'm curious, have you tried [related activity]?\"\n4. **Offer alternatives**: If you need to use the bathroom or step away for a moment, it's okay to say something like, \"Excuse me, I need to grab a drink real quick. Can we catch up later?\" or \"I need to make a quick phone call. Can we finish this conversation later?\" This way, you're not abandoning the conversation, but rather taking a brief break to attend to your needs.\n5. **Communicate your needs**: If you feel like your friend is dominating the conversation and you're not getting a chance to share your thoughts or experiences, try saying something like, \"Hey, I value our conversations, but I also want to share some things with you. Can we make sure to give each other space to talk?\" or \"I love hearing about your stories, but I also want to share some of my own experiences. Can we make it more of a two-way conversation?\"\n\nRemember to approach the situation with empathy and understanding.

In fact, it's a crucial part of self-discovery!\n\nNow, regarding your parents' concerns, it's understandable that they're worried about your career prospects. However, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with them about your goals and aspirations.

For example:\n\n\"I understand that you're worried about my career, but I feel like I'm not being true to myself by staying in a job that's not a good fit. I want to take this opportunity to travel and recharge, and I believe it will ultimately benefit my career in the long run.

It can be overwhelming, but don't worry, I'm here to guide you through it.\n\nFirst, let's start with the basics. When you're buying individual health insurance, you're not part of a group plan like you would be through an employer or university. Instead, you're buying a policy directly from an insurance company.\n\nHere are the general steps to follow:\n\n1. **Determine your eligibility for subsidies**: If you're eligible for subsidies, you'll need to apply for them through the Health Insurance Marketplace (healthcare.gov) or directly with an insurance company. Subsidies can help reduce your premium costs.\n2. **Research and compare plans**: Look for plans that cover your needs and budget. You can compare plans on healthcare.gov, insurance company websites, or through a licensed broker. Make a list of the plans that interest you.\n3. **Check the plan's network**: Ensure the plan has a network of providers that includes your primary care physician, specialists, and hospitals. You can check the plan's provider directory or ask the insurance company.\n4. **Review the plan's coverage**: Check the plan's coverage for:\n\t* Doctor visits and copays\n\t* Prescription medication coverage\n\t* Hospital stays and surgeries\n\t* Mental health and substance abuse services\n\t* Preventive care and wellness services\n5. **Check the plan's out-of-pocket costs**: Review the plan's:\n\t* Deductible (the amount you pay before insurance kicks in)\n\t* Copays and coinsurance (the amount you pay for services after meeting the deductible)\n\t* Maximum out-of-pocket (the maximum amount you'll pay in a year)\n6. **Enroll in a plan**: Once you've chosen a plan, enroll by the deadline (usually December 15th for a January 1st start date). You can enroll on healthcare.gov or directly with the insurance company.\n7. **Verify your coverage**: After enrolling, verify that your coverage is active and your providers are part of the plan's network.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Short-term plans are not a good option**: These plans are not ACA-compliant and may not provide the same level of coverage as major medical plans.\n* **Look for a plan with a high-quality network**: A good network can make a big difference in your healthcare experience.\n* **Don't skip the deductible**: Make sure you understand how the deductible works and plan accordingly to avoid surprise medical bills.\n* **Keep records of your enrollment**: Keep a record of your enrollment, including your plan's details and provider network.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your journey to buying individual health insurance!

It's essential to recognize that relaxation is a necessary part of maintaining your overall well-being. It's not about being lazy; it's about recharging your batteries.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to separate your relaxation time from your \"me-time\" or \"self-care\" activities. Instead of thinking, \"I'm relaxing because I deserve it,\" try reframing it as, \"I'm taking a break to recharge and refocus.\" This mindset shift can help you feel more intentional and less guilty about taking time for yourself.\n\nAnother approach is to explore different relaxation activities that bring you joy, but aren't necessarily \"productive\" in the classical sense. For example, you might try:\n\n1. Guided meditation or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind.\n2. Reading a book or listening to music that helps you unwind.\n3. Taking a relaxing bath or shower.\n4. Practicing yoga or stretching to release tension.\n5. Writing in a journal or creating art to express yourself.\n\nThe key is to find activities that help you feel calm and centered, without the pressure to achieve something specific.

While it's true that excessive spending can be a symptom of mental health issues, it's not necessarily a direct correlation. Your decision to give away $40 to each of the two individuals doesn't necessarily mean you have a spending disorder. It's more about your values and priorities.\n\nThat being said, it's understandable that you're worried about your parents' reaction. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with them about your decision. You could frame it as an act of kindness and charity, rather than reckless spending. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey Mom and Dad, I know you're worried about my spending, but I wanted to explain that I recently encountered some homeless individuals who were in need. I felt compelled to help them out, and I gave them $40 each. I know it might seem like a lot, but I believe it's important to show compassion and kindness to those in need. I'm not planning on making a habit of it, but I wanted to do something good for someone else. I'd love to discuss this further with you and find a way to balance my charitable impulses with our family's financial goals.\"\n\nIt's also essential to consider your own financial situation and priorities.

However, it's crucial to maintain a balance between your charitable giving and your own financial well-being.\n\nTo avoid any potential issues with your parents, you might want to set a budget for yourself and stick to it. You could allocate a small portion of your spending money specifically for charitable giving, so you can continue to help those in need while also being responsible with your finances.\n\nLastly, remember that your decision to give away money doesn't define your financial responsibility or your character. It's a positive act that shows you care about others, and it's something to be proud of!"

By \"charging\" them rent, you might be inadvertently pushing them into a more precarious situation.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, it's true that you might not be able to afford health coverage for them, and it's unfair to expect you to absorb those costs. However, it's essential to explore other options, such as:\n\n1. Medicaid: As their child, you might be able to apply for Medicaid coverage for them, depending on your income and their eligibility.\n2.

Non-profit organizations: Local non-profits, community centers, or religious organizations might offer assistance with healthcare, food, and other basic needs.\n\nRegarding the \"rent\" idea, it's crucial to consider the potential tax implications. As you mentioned, you would likely need to report the income as additional income on your taxes. This could lead to a tax liability, which might be more significant than you anticipate.\n\nAdditionally, \"charging\" your parents rent could create an awkward dynamic in your living situation. It might lead to feelings of resentment, guilt, or even financial stress for both parties. It's essential to prioritize maintaining a positive and supportive relationship with your parents.\n\nInstead of \"charging\" rent, consider exploring other options to support your parents' needs while also respecting their autonomy and dignity. You might discuss alternative solutions with them, such as:\n\n1. Helping them find affordable housing or a different living arrangement that suits their needs and budget.\n2. Offering to help with expenses, such as groceries or household bills, without creating a formal rental agreement.\n3. Supporting them in exploring other resources and benefits they might be eligible for, such as Medicaid or other government assistance programs.\n\nRemember that it's essential to prioritize your parents' well-being and dignity.

I just negotiated HARD for two weeks to myself, with no visits, just to try and recover a bit and just when I thought he understood I wound up on two different calls with him today, for a total of THREE HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES.\n\nI don't know what to do. My life is starting to feel unrecognizable six months in and while I love him I am starting to doubt our future. I am going to lay down some hard rules tomorrow -- like I am hanging up after 30m, tops -- and could use some advice on what to say.\n\nMy mental and physical health is starting to deteriorate as a direct result of the demands this relationship is placing on my time while we're apart, and frankly how the time goes when we're together. I've been trying to imagine a future together and it is getting harder to do because I increasingly just desperately focus on how much I need to be ALONE in peace and quiet to recuperate. I'd otherwise say he was the love of my life. I'd be devastated to lose him but I cannot maintain this status quo and am starting to miss my former single life, which was very happy, routine-oriented and content.\n\nPlease help me, Reddit! &lt;3\n\nEdit: Wow, so much input! Thank you, I'm reading everything and hope to reply to as many people as I can. To clarify, this is really stemming from anxiety, not weird controlling or abuser vibes on his part, I promise. I feel nothing but love and he's a self-aware and thoughtful person. He's recently moved so has less going on than usual as he adjusts to a new city while I have a super full life and am adjusting to making room for a relationship. Neither of us planned for, expected or were looking for such a serious thing so it's been a big change for both of us.\n\nThanks to all who are providing direct scripts on what to say and positive examples of LDRs, it has been really helpful. I only learned about boundaries like four years ago after my first marriage ended (like I literally read a book called \"Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin\" and was FLOORED bc those did not exist in my family) and I'm still practicing how to successfully implement them. I was expressing needs and boundaries, then feeling guilty and changing them, then freaking out and defining them again, which definitely contributes to his anxiety I'm sure. I'm going to be more stalwart and confident in them now.  I was only just able to talk about the pup on our last visit and it's definitely a hard topic but he couldn't have listened or reacted more thoughtfully. He had already scheduled an appointment with a vet behaviorist.\n\nAnd yeah, we've been low-key mutually crushing for a long time so to discover the romantic connection has all been a bit of a dream come true and we're both scared to fuck up or lose the other. We also have verrry different approaches to daily routines, so there's been a lack of understanding how important/necessary it is to me I think. But, he called me yesterday evening to say he'd been thinking and wants to really honor this time of respite and that he is understanding what I'm saying and he is also going to throw himself into his own projects and life more and let us have some more space. So, maybe he saw this (uh, hey, babe!) or just came to this conclusion of his own accord. Either way, I got my first 8 hours of sleep in 6 months last night and am like ecstatic with relief.

It's clear that you're trying to communicate your needs to your boyfriend, but he's not understanding or respecting them. Here are some suggestions on what to say and do:\n\n1. **Be clear and direct**: When you set boundaries, be specific and assertive. Instead of saying \"I need my sleep and routine,\" say \"I need to go to bed at 10 PM and wake up at 7 AM to feel rested and focused. Can we schedule our calls accordingly?\"\n2. **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of saying \"you never understand me,\" say \"I feel overwhelmed when we don't have a set schedule. I need some predictability in my life.\" This way, you're expressing your feelings and needs without blaming or attacking your partner.\n3. **Avoid guilt trips**: Try not to make your boyfriend feel guilty for not understanding your needs. Instead, focus on your own feelings and needs. For example, \"I'm feeling really exhausted and stressed when we don't have a routine. I need some time to recharge.\"\n4. **Offer alternatives**: Instead of saying \"you can't come visit every weekend,\" say \"I'd love to see you every other weekend, but I also need some time to myself. Can we find a compromise?\"\n5. **Practice assertive communication**: Remember that setting boundaries is not about being mean or controlling, but about being clear and direct. Practice assertive communication by using a firm but gentle tone, making eye contact, and using a confident body language.\n\nHere's an example script you can use when setting boundaries:\n\n\"Hey [boyfriend's name], I wanted to talk to you about our schedule. I know we've been having a lot of fun together, but I'm feeling really exhausted and overwhelmed. I need some time to myself to recharge. Can we schedule our calls and visits in a way that allows me to get some rest and have some time to myself? I love spending time with you, but I also need some space to prioritize my own needs.\"\n\nRemember that setting boundaries is a process, and it may take some time for your boyfriend to adjust. Be patient, consistent, and clear in your communication. Good luck!"

I did find a few things that bothered me. My bf still has all of the nudes from his ex and chats from when they were together. Now I have it the benefit of the doubt and said to myself that he forgot about them, but what I thought was worrisome it’s the fact that the chat is muted. There were no new text messages between them, but still, I’ve been thinking about it a lot… at times based on his behavior I do get the feeling of him not being completely over his ex, but apart from that what should I do now?",
    "human": "I can go through my husbands (25+ years married) phone whenever I want - as he can go through mine.\n\nThe thing is, I don't - not even because I trust him but more because I can't be bothered to look for something. \n\nTalk to him about how you feel - communication is key here.",
    "base_reply": "I'm glad you're acknowledging that going through his phone was a bad thing and you won't do it again. That's a huge step in taking responsibility for your actions.\n\nRegarding the situation, it's understandable that you're concerned about the nudes and muted chats from his ex. It's natural to wonder why he still has them, especially if there are no new messages between them. It's also reasonable to feel uneasy about his behavior, even if he says he's over his ex.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. Approach the conversation calmly and try not to accuse or blame him. Instead, express your feelings and thoughts, and ask him to explain why he still has those nudes and chats. Be specific about what bothered you, like the fact that the chats are muted.\n\nIt's possible that he forgot about them or didn't realize how it would make you feel. It's also possible that he's holding onto them for sentimental reasons or as a way to cope with his feelings about his ex. Listen to his response and try to understand his perspective.\n\nHowever, pay attention to his words and actions. If he downplays your concerns, gets defensive, or doesn't seem to care about your feelings, that might be a red flag. If he's genuinely willing to work through this with you and address your concerns, that could be a positive sign.\n\nRemember, communication is key in relationships. It's okay to have differences, but it's essential to address them in a respectful and open manner. Take this opportunity to have a deeper conversation about your relationship, your feelings, and what you both want from each other.\n\nLastly, consider seeking outside help if you feel like you need additional support or guidance. A therapist or counselor can provide you with a safe and neutral space to work through your concerns and develop strategies for building a stronger, healthier relationship."

You don't have to exhaust yourself trying to cover every topic or say everything you want to say in a single conversation.\n\nHere are some strategies to help you walk away from a conversation without regrets:\n\n1. **Set a mental boundary**: Before entering a conversation, define what you want to achieve or discuss. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Practice active listening**: Pay attention to the other person, and show that you're engaged. This can help you avoid feeling like you're not getting your points across.\n3. **Use the \"sandwich method\"**: When sharing your thoughts or opinions, try to sandwich them between two neutral or positive statements. This can help you feel more confident and heard.\n4. **Know when to wrap it up**: If you're feeling drained or like you're not getting anywhere, it's okay to politely wrap up the conversation. You can say something like, \"I think we've covered a lot, and I appreciate our conversation. I should probably get going.\"\n5. **Follow up with a summary**: If you're worried about forgetting to mention something important, try summarizing the key points you discussed at the end of the conversation. This can help you feel more satisfied and reduce regrets.\n6. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that it's okay to not say everything in one conversation. You can always follow up with the other person later or discuss the topic again in the future.\n\nAs for links to similar threads, I found a great article on \"How to Walk Away from a Conversation Without Regrets\" by Psychology Today. It provides some excellent tips and strategies for navigating difficult conversations.\n\nRemember, prioritizing your own well-being and boundaries is key. By setting realistic expectations and practicing effective communication, you can reduce regrets and feel more confident in your conversations.\n\nI hope these suggestions help!

This shows you've taken the time to read their profile and care about getting to know them.\n\n**Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share more about themselves.

You're not asking to break up, but to gain some independence, which is a significant change. It's crucial to discuss this with your partner and understand their feelings, concerns, and expectations.\n\nBefore having this conversation, take some time to reflect on what you hope to achieve by having your own space. Are you looking for a sense of autonomy, a chance to rediscover yourself, or something else? Be clear about your motivations and what you're willing to compromise on.\n\nWhen you have the conversation, be honest and direct about your feelings, but also listen to your partner's perspective. They may have concerns about the impact on your relationship or feel insecure about losing the closeness you've built. Be patient, empathetic, and willing to work together to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nIt's also important to remember that this is not a reflection on your partner or the relationship. You're not saying that you're unhappy or that the relationship is flawed; you're simply seeking personal growth and independence. Approach the conversation with an open mind, and be prepared to find a compromise that allows you to maintain your relationship while still honoring your need for independence.\n\nLastly, consider having a trial period where you have your own space, but still maintain a connection with your partner.

Meetup groups: Instead of focusing on age-specific groups, try searching for groups that align with your hobbies or interests.

Coffee shop or co-working spaces: Many cities have co-working spaces or coffee shops that host events, workshops, or networking sessions.

You might be surprised by how many people are in similar situations and are willing to connect on a deeper level.\n\nRemember, building meaningful friendships takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Focus on building connections with people who share your values, interests, and sense of humor, and be patient with the process.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of rekindling old friendships. While you mentioned you don't want to go back to your childhood friends, it's possible to reconnect with people from your past who share similar interests or values. You might be surprised by how much you have in common with someone you thought you'd lost touch with.\n\nKeep in mind that true friendships are built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication.

He’s sweet, attentive, gentle, intelligent, funny, has great communication skills, many friends, hobbies, great job, the sex is amazing, we get along so well etc. etc. He was straightforward from the beginning that he would like to have an open relationship, because it’s what he prefers, and he has a really high sex drive - I’ve never been in an open one, but agreed to, because I really adore and trust this man.\n\nHowever, for the past few months, the reality hit me, and the thought of him with other people started to really bother me.

He didn’t go into details but it was some woman from their family. He said it was not violent, and happened only few times, but he attended therapy for years and said he was okay now - he also seems very stable overall, even though he was shaking as he was telling me this. He said he never told anyone, only his family and his best friend know this. He doesn’t know if there is any correlation between the abuse and his promiscuity, he just explained that he always had really high libido since he can remember, and likes to feel wanted and close to people.

This helps to own your emotions and avoid blame. For instance, \"When you made that comment, I felt dismissed and hurt.\"\n4. **Avoid getting sidetracked**: Refuse to engage with their counter-attack or counter-claim. Politely say, \"I understand your point, but let's not get sidetracked. Can we please focus on the issue at hand?\"\n5. **Set clear boundaries**: If they continue to deflect, it's essential to set boundaries. Let them know that you're willing to discuss the issue, but not if they're not willing to listen and take responsibility for their actions. You can say, \"I understand we have different perspectives, but I'd like to resolve this issue. If you're not willing to listen and take responsibility, I'm not sure we can have a productive conversation.\"\n6. **Practice active listening**: Make an effort to truly listen to their perspective, even if you don't agree with it. Sometimes, people deflect because they feel unheard or misunderstood. By actively listening, you may be able to diffuse tension and create a more constructive conversation.\n7. **Consider a time-out**: If the situation becomes too heated or unproductive, it might be necessary to take a break or step away from the conversation. This can help you recharge and approach the issue with a clearer head.\n\nRemember, dealing with deflectors requires patience, empathy, and assertiveness. By staying calm, focused, and committed to the issue at hand, you can increase the chances of a productive and respectful conversation."

    "sentence": "My husband’s constant complaining about not having a career and “pursuing his dream” is driving me insane.\n\nMy husband (33) and I (30) have been married for seven years and have two beautiful children together, and living what many would consider the American dream. We aren’t rich but with both of our incomes combined we make a comfortable living. Since before we got married my husband always wanted to pursue a career in Aviation, and becoming a commercial pilot has always been his lifelong passion and something he’s dreamt of doing since he was a child. \n\nHe completed a two year program and earned his Associate’s degree in Aviation but due to some \nroadblocks along the way with getting his private pilots license due to a medical condition that required clearance he was not able to obtain his private pilot’s license and pursue his career path. He was finally able to get clearance however all of his tests expired and things got put on the back burner as a result. We met and married a year after he finished school. He now has an associates degree in aviation that cost us 15k worth of student loan debt (paid off) and there is nothing to show for it. We also paid off my student loans in the process another 15k.\n\nSince that time he has worked what he would consider dead end jobs, jumping from one job to the next. He’s initially happy when he first gets a new job but within six months to a year he falls into the same pattern of burn out and depression. Complaints about how his life isn’t going anywhere, that’s he’s depressed, that I do nothing to help him pursue his dreams that I don’t support him, how he wishes he could just start over. He’s always looking for someone to blame and it’s usually me. Then he begins the job search all over again for what he would consider another “dead end” job. After seven years of this constant cycle it has really began to weigh heavily on me. I’m now at a point that when he starts the complaints and job searches that I just ignore him because I’m so mentally exhausted, and I know nothing I say will make a difference. \n\nI love my husband so much, he’s an amazing husband and father and I would give anything to see him happy, and pursuing his dreams. I wish love and support was all that were necessary and if that were the case we would have been there by now, but money is a huge factor. Becoming a commercial pilot is an extremely expensive and time consuming endeavor 80-100k minimum just to obtain the license itself and not including the 1500 hours that is required after that to even get hired anywhere. I’ve tried to get my husband to pursue getting a more “affordable” degree or to take on a trade just so he can have a solid and stable career with benefits and job satisfaction just as a stepping stone to fund his flying in the process. However, he never sees anything through, and he never likes the options I give him, and the things he has pursued never work out. He wants to snap his fingers and watch everything magically fall in his lap. But the hard truth is the career he has chosen to pursue will take him years to complete unless we get ourselves in a bunch of debt just so he can get it done quickly. \n\nI know he’s never going to be happy until he is doing what he wants to do and this will continue to weigh heavily on our marriage. Some people are content just having a job to pay the bills and make a comfortable living, he will never be that person. I feel like he’s always going to be like the highschool quarterback who would have made it to the NFL if it wasn’t for an injury that held them back and I’ll never hear the end of it. He knows how I feel, we do well with communication in our marriage. I’m just so tired of repeating myself like a broken record that I’ve resorted to silence with him. \n\nWe only get two days off together every two weeks due to our schedules and he’s ruined our weekend off together because he’s been sulking about his job and lack of career. \n\n\nTDLR: I’m just frustrated and needed somewhere to vent my thoughts. Thank you for listening.",
    "human": "Now is a great time to be getting into an aviation career. Airlines are hiring like gangbusters and that will only increase. I'm working on making this career transition now as amatter of fact. I flew some a number of years ago and have to redo some training. So what. It's just something that has to be done. \n\n$80-$100k is a ripoff and if he's looking at the school I think he is, the training is not great for the price. He should find a local Part 61 flight school or independent CFI with access to a plane and start working on his ratings one at a time. At least knock out PPL and IFR before going the accelerated big loan route. If financing is an issue, AOPA has reasonable, smaller loans that can help you get across the finish line. If you're both making decent money maybe he can do it out of pocket. \n\nOnce he gets his CPL and CFI (CFII hopefully), there are a number of flying jobs he could get to build to 1500hrs. He could instruct, fly part 135 charter, pipeline patrol, banner tow etc. \n\nIt won't be easy or cheap, but you don't have to blow $100k all at once, and the ROI could be great. Regional  FOs are upgrading to captain within a year or two, and with that comes six figures before you're even at a major.\n\nHe just needs to get serious about it and figure out how to make it work.

It sounds like you've been carrying the emotional burden of your husband's unfulfilled dreams and the financial stress that comes with it.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your husband's feelings are valid, and it's okay that he wants to pursue his passion. However, it's also crucial to recognize that his expectations might not align with reality. The financial and time commitments required to become a commercial pilot are significant, and it's essential to have a plan and a backup plan.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that you've been trying to support him and find alternative solutions, but he's not open to them. It's not fair to put the burden solely on you to fix his problems or make his dreams come true. It's essential to have a more collaborative conversation about his goals and what he's willing to do to achieve them.\n\nConsidering your husband's tendency to get stuck in a cycle of complaining and job searching, it might be helpful to set some boundaries and encourage him to take small steps towards his goals rather than expecting a magic solution. This could mean setting realistic goals, breaking them down into smaller tasks, and holding him accountable for making progress.\n\nIt's also essential to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself during this challenging time. It's okay to take a step back and focus on your own needs and goals. You deserve to feel fulfilled and happy in your marriage, and it's essential to communicate your needs and expectations to your husband.\n\nLastly, consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns. It's essential to express your emotions and needs in a non-accusatory way, focusing on your own feelings rather than blaming or attacking him. This might help him understand your perspective and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle. Many couples face similar challenges, and it's essential to prioritize communication, empathy, and understanding to navigate these complex issues."

I got pregnant at the start of the pandemic and since then everything has gone downhill with our relationship. We were not really prepared to have a baby, we were in couples counseling (he cheated just before the wedding...) but it happened and we have a 1.5 year old. An argument in the car got out of control 6 weeks ago and I said maybe we need to separate, he can live at the house we are renovating and me and the baby can stay with my family. His response was \"I'll kill you before I let that happen\". \n\nI took my phone out to call the police but obviously he was driving at the time. He apologized and said he was angry and didn't mean it. Says that he said it because I threatened to take his child away. I said no such thing, only that we could live separately because we've been arguing a lot.\nHe's never laid a hand on me but he's always had anger issues, apart from happiness, anger is the only emotion he shows. I locked myself in the bathroom when we got to our house and told him to stay away from me. I don't REALLY think he would do that but I also never thought he would cheat on me or EVER thtreaten bodiy harm to me either. The day after he undertook to find resources about anger management and reached out to his therapist. \n\nI couldn't share a bed with him for a while...I intentionally stayed up late so I wouldn't have to see him. Being around him gave me so much anxiety. I contacted a divorce lawyer the next day and told them everything just so someone would have an account of what happened. Eventually I guess I decided to move past it for the sake of our family. That was over a mo th ago. But I'm feeling like my husband is just so fucking selfish. He likes to have meat at every meal and a certain meal he makes has been making me sick - migraines, coughing, sore throat, nausea, watery eyes because of the frying in the pan. I asked a week ago if he could please not cook that dish anymore when Im home because I've been trying to ignore it but I feel so sick when he makes it EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK.\n\nHe knew this a week ago. We are not in our own home and he could go there to make it if he wants. He asked today if he could make it and I reminded him that it has been making him sick. I suggested he make it another day when I'm not around, but it always fucking HAS to be Friday after work. We're staying in a decent sized house with good ventilation and the smell still travels upstairs, into bedrooms, washrooms etc. There is NO escape. I'm sick of it and sick from it, so is my family. I asked if its really more important than me not getting sick. Obviously that meant nothing to him. I got pissed, told him he's selfish and that he's probably going to do what he wants anyway and that if he's going to be selfish, I will too and on Mother's day he can go see hid mom by himself. Fuck that. Note that I like his mom fine but when mothers day rolls around his first thought is when do we go see his mother and not, you know, asking your wife who is a new mother wtf she wants to do until I point it out to him.\n\nIm honestly getting fucking tired of this relationship. I don't know what to fucking do now and I'm sure to him I'm being dramatic. Me trying to get away after being threatened is, in his words, me making everything about me. Because someone threatening to kill you if you leave is not a big deal? And Im sure me getting pissed off that he will intentionally make me sick is also just being dramatic to him. I'm not sure what to do but I could use some help or kind words.\n\nTL;DR: Husband uttered a threat during an argument, and is overall being a selfish ungrateful jerk.

Focus on the here and now, rather than worrying about what might happen in the future.

Each person is unique, and comparisons can lead to unrealistic expectations.

Try reframing your thoughts by asking yourself, \"What can I learn or appreciate about this moment right now?\" or \"What small step can I take to make this moment more enjoyable?\"\n6. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you stay present and focused on the progress you're making, rather than constantly looking ahead.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.

I can't stop talking to him because if I do so then I feel terrible to a sense that I can't even explain, I know feeling this way about someone is not right but I can't control on how I feel. I thought that if things go like the way it is going we might get back together but he will be moving to United Kingdom for studies for 1 year (we are from India) in 8 months, I have no idea how am I gonna deal with this whole thing. He is an integral part of my life, he is not just my love but my friend, my rock, my happiness, my half of the world.\n\nTL;DR:- I am very confused about how to deal with this situation, me and and ex- boyfriend have a very complicated history, we were perfect together but due to some misunderstandings and few of my faults he broke up with me and now that we have started talking, my feelings are getting stronger towards him. I don't want to loose the connection that we have but I can't see him with someone else too.\n\nEdit- We are in a relationship now.",

It takes a lot of courage to admit vulnerability and work through the complexities of your past.\n\nIt's understandable that you're struggling with the uncertainty of his upcoming move and the potential outcome of your relationship. It's natural to worry about losing the connection you've rekindled, but it's essential to focus on the present and have open conversations with your partner about your concerns.\n\nIn this situation, it's crucial to prioritize communication and trust. Have an honest talk with your partner about your feelings, fears, and expectations. Share your concerns about the potential distance and how it might affect your relationship. Be specific about what you're looking for in the future and what you're willing to work through together.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge that your partner's decision to move to the UK might be a significant opportunity for personal growth and development for him. While it's natural to feel attached and want to maintain the connection, it's crucial to respect his desires and goals, even if they differ from yours.\n\nLastly, remember that relationships are about growth, compromise, and understanding. It's okay to acknowledge that you can't control how you feel, but you can control how you respond to those feelings. Focus on nurturing the connection you have now and work on building a stronger foundation for the future, regardless of the distance.\n\nRemember, relationships are a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time."

It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and consider how to approach the conversation with your girlfriend.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your initial okay with it was genuine, and it's normal to have mixed emotions later on. Now, take a step back and try to identify what specifically is bothering you. Is it the idea of her spending time with her ex, or is it something else?\n\nWhen you're ready to talk to your girlfriend, try to approach the conversation with an open and non-accusatory tone. Instead of saying \"You're not allowed to go,\" say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about the other day when you asked if it was okay to study at your ex's house. I initially said yes, but I've been thinking about it, and I have to admit, it's been making me a bit uncomfortable.\"\n\nBe honest about your feelings and try to explain why. You can say something like, \"I know you're just trying to get help with your studies, but the thought of you being at his house, even if it's just for studying, makes me feel a bit anxious. I know it's irrational, but I need to be honest with you about how I'm feeling.\"\n\nRemember, your girlfriend should respect your feelings and be willing to listen to your concerns. It's possible that she's not aware of how you're feeling, and this conversation can actually bring you closer together.

It might also avoid any potential legal or financial consequences down the line.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that the bank might not be as understanding or might even report the mistake to the credit bureaus, which could harm your credit score. Additionally, if you're not sure how the bank will react, it's understandable to want to avoid the potential fallout.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: take some time to gather your thoughts, and consider speaking with a financial advisor or a trusted friend or family member who's knowledgeable about these things. They can help you weigh the pros and cons and come up with a plan that's best for your specific situation.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution here.

Also *me and my bf* for the title((also also, we are engaged, I just call him my boyfriend because it's easier))\n\nMy grandma (79) wants me (21F) and my bf(22M) to get married before she dies, which means within this week. The doctors initially gave her days, maybe a week left to live last Thursday. She's been in hospice at home since. But now the visiting hospice nurse came and said she's doing great and looks as tho she could live way past that. (She has late stage renal failure and failure of the liver.)\n\nMy bf and I have been together for 5 years and are in no place to get married anytime soon. I get that there's no \"right time\" but we both agree now is absolutely the wrong time. Only one of us works and we can't afford our own place, none the less a wedding. And his parents are out of the country for medical care and will be for the next two months. I live with my grandma and currently am in charge of her hospice care. Family is helping but the ones who are helping the most all tested positive for Covid so it's down to me. \n\nHer dying wish is that we get married, she said this in front of 50 family members and has basically put us on the spot. Everyone has been backing her and my grandpa up for this. Even my parents who I've said \"no this isn't happening\" to. I'm not the first family member she's basically forced marriage onto which is also why everyone isn't taking my bf's and my wants seriously.\n\nI can't exactly tell a dying woman to her face she's gonna die without me getting married and that's the end to it, and with this \"she's either dying any day now or running on empty for a few years\" bs we're getting form the medical team I can't just keep going along and pushing it off day by day, especially since literally everyone keeps bringing it up. \n\nWhat exactly can I do? \n\nTL;DR: Dying grandma and family wants me to get married, I don't want to and I also don't wanna be a *meanie\n\nINFO: I'm getting a lot of mock wedding comments. The answer to that is no. It's very awkward and uncomfortable and also a waste of money &amp; time. Lies and drama spread quick through my family and it just genuinely doesn't feel right to both my bf and I. She's mentally here still so treating her like an old mindless lady won't do anything either. I've seen suggestions of just going on with it until she's gone and honestly that might have to happen.\nShe's not a fan of others having autonomy over their own lives so I can't outright say we have rights. People have tried and it didn't end well for them. Thank you all tho for reminded me we have free will and don't have to bend over for anyone. It's hard to remember in the position we're in.\n\nA hospice social worker comes tomorrow, if I can I'll pull them aside and ask about this.\n\nINFO 2: Social worker hasn't showed up yet, will update afterwards. I live with her and can easily get kicked out for even looking at her wrong, my bf and I have no where else to go and live in an expensive state. I'm disabled and trying to get disability and currently awaiting an appeal hearing. He lives with his parents as well, so we're literally in no place to get married. We've barely started our lives and Covid has not helped.\n\nSaying \"No\" to a Christian religious narcissist who's had control over me my entire life and others is like pulling the tail of a wolf. The whole pack will go after me as well. We can't tell her we're not ready either, because she'll just do a speech of how she was married at 13 and had her first child at 14. I know her rebuttals as well as I know the back of my hand. My boyfriend and I are engaged but I guess in her eyes it's been too long of an engagement and we're just \"shacking up\" We're also Latino if that helps anyone understand there's a cultural background attached to it. \n\nShe's doing this to another cousin of mine who isn't married to her baby daddy all at the same time. The difference is she's able to leave and come back when my grandma is dying, I'm stuck here.\n\nHere's an example I just remembered happened about 10 years ago:\n My grandma wanted my uncle and his now wife to get married in our church. The wife and her family are of Catholic denomination and he's not religious. They chose to get married in a Catholic church so my grandma banned us from showing up to his wedding. Literally no one from our side of the family went and we didn't speak to him for about 8 years. I was about 10-11 at the time and didn't even know when he got married. She's since had a \"change of heart\" and \"apologized\" to him but the damage is done. And with what's going on now it's clear she hasn't changed. She's a textbook narcissist.\n\n I'm reading some comments from people who can sympathize with me and I'm sorry you've had to go through that, and I'm also proud you've helped break the cycle. It's very rough, but we'll get through it.\n\nUpdate: The social worker came and my grandma told me to leave the room. Didn't get to speak with them. Just great.",

It's clear that you and your boyfriend are in a tough spot, and I'm here to offer some advice that may help you navigate this complex situation.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and the well-being of your relationship. It's understandable that you're hesitant to get married, and it's crucial to respect your own boundaries and decisions.\n\nIn this situation, it's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and compassion. While it's challenging to tell a dying person what they want to hear, it's also important to be honest and authentic. You can acknowledge your grandma's wishes and express your gratitude for her love and concern, but also explain your reasons for not being ready to get married.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n\"I understand that you want us to get married, and I appreciate your love and support. However, [bf's name] and I have been discussing this, and we don't feel that we're ready to get married at this time. We're still building our lives, and we need some time to focus on our individual goals and aspirations. I know this may not be what you had hoped for, but I hope you can understand our perspective and respect our decision.\"\n\nIt's also important to set boundaries and be clear about what you're and aren't willing to do. You can say something like:\n\n\"I understand that you're disappointed, but I'm not comfortable with the idea of a mock wedding or pretending to get married just to make you happy. I think it would be better for us to focus on making the most of the time we have with you and enjoying your company without putting pressure on us to make a decision that's not right for us.\"\n\nRemember that you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your decisions. You and your boyfriend have the right to make choices that are best for your lives, and it's essential to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to prioritize your own self-care during this challenging time. Make sure to take time for yourself, practice self-compassion, and seek support from people who understand and respect your boundaries.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and your well-being, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect."

    "human": "I'm pretty sure you're a boy. Otherwise the question would be \"How to gain more time when dating?\"\nFor my experience. Talk to him/her from an **emotional** point of view.\n*It's much more effective*",
    "base_reply": "Gaining patience when dating can be a tough one, but it's a crucial skill to develop for a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Here's the thing: patience isn't just about waiting for things to happen; it's also about being present in the moment and accepting what is, rather than what you want it to be.\n\nFirst, recognize that everyone has their own pace, and it's okay if it's not the same as yours. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole – it's just not going to fit. Instead, focus on understanding where your partner is at and being okay with that. Ask them about their feelings and boundaries, and listen actively to their responses.\n\nNext, work on building trust. When you trust someone, you're more likely to be patient and understanding because you feel secure in the relationship. So, focus on being reliable, communicative, and supportive – these qualities will help build trust and create a sense of stability.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that patience is a muscle that can be developed over time. Practice mindfulness and meditation to help you stay present and focused on the present moment. When you're feeling frustrated or anxious, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're not in control of the other person's emotions or actions.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to have different expectations. It's not about sacrificing your own needs and desires, but about being willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Communicate openly and honestly with your partner about what you need and want, and be willing to listen to their perspective as well.\n\nSo, to sum it up, gaining patience when dating is all about being present, building trust, practicing mindfulness, and being willing to compromise. It's not always easy, but it's worth it in the long run."

And is this even possible?\n\nObjectively through my accomplishments and work evaluations, I'd classify myself as an achiever/high performer at work.

Before big presentations, I'm riddled with anxiety in the days/even weekend leading up to it. The night before the presentation, I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get any sleep. I over-prepare and overthink. I constantly fear whatever negative reaction the stakeholder/client/etc will say, if it can go wrong, and this feeling that I'll make a fool of myself and they'll think badly of me.

Let's break it down and explore some strategies to help you detach your emotions and self-worth from your work, while still maintaining your high performance.\n\n**Why it's important to detach:**\n\n1. **Reduced stress and anxiety**: When you tie your self-worth to your work, you'll always be on edge, constantly worrying about making mistakes or not meeting expectations. This can lead to burnout, decreased motivation, and decreased overall well-being.\n2. **Increased creativity and innovation**: When you're not burdened by the need to constantly prove yourself, you'll be more likely to take risks, explore new ideas, and innovate, which can lead to even greater success.\n3. **Better work-life balance**: By detaching your self-worth from your work, you'll be able to separate your professional and personal life, allowing for a more balanced and fulfilling existence.\n\n**Strategies to detach:**\n\n1. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of defining your self-worth by your work, focus on your values, skills, and strengths as a person. Remember that your worth is not defined by a single aspect of your life.\n2. **Set realistic expectations**: Acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect. Recognize that your worth is not tied to your performance, but to who you are as a person.\n3. **Develop a growth mindset**: Focus on learning and growth, rather than perfection. Embrace challenges as opportunities to learn and improve, rather than threats to your ego.\n4. **Practice mindfulness and self-compassion**: When you start to feel anxious or self-doubting, take a step back, acknowledge your thoughts, and remind yourself that they're just thoughts, not facts. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.\n5. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of work. This will help you maintain a sense of purpose and identity beyond your professional achievements.\n\n**What would happen if you cared less about work?**\n\nIt's possible that your performance might not suffer, but it's also possible that it could. Here's why:\n\n1. **Motivation**: If you're not motivated by the desire to prove yourself, you might not put in the same level of effort. However, if you're intrinsically motivated by a sense of purpose or passion for your work, you might still perform well.\n2. **Focus**: Without the pressure to constantly prove yourself, you might be able to focus more on the task at hand, rather than worrying about how others perceive you.\n3. **Creativity and innovation**: As mentioned earlier, not being burdened by the need to prove yourself can lead to increased creativity and innovation.\n\n**Would you still have the same achievements and success?**\n\nIt's difficult to say, as it depends on various factors, such as your current motivation, skills, and work environment. However, it's possible that you might still achieve great things without the pressure to constantly prove yourself. Remember that success is not solely defined by your professional achievements, but by your overall well-being and fulfillment.\n\nRemember, it's a process to detach your emotions and self-worth from your work. It takes time, effort, and practice, but it's worth it for your overall well-being. Start by making small changes, like reframing your thinking and prioritizing self-care, and see how it impacts your life."

You can also have a yard sale or garage sale.\n2. **Freelance work:** Offer your skills to others on freelance platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, or Freelancer.com. You can provide services like virtual assistance, content writing, social media management, or data entry. This way, you can earn some money without committing to a full-time job.\n3. **Participate in online surveys:** Sign up with survey sites like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, or Vindale Research. While it won't make you rich, you can earn some extra cash by completing surveys.\n4. **Deliver food or packages:** Companies like Foodora, Uber Eats, or Amazon Flex might have opportunities for you to work as a delivery driver. You can also consider working as a package delivery driver for companies like Amazon.\n5. **Ask a friend or family member for help:** If you have a good relationship with someone, consider asking for a short-term loan or help with transportation costs. Make sure to repay them as soon as you can.\n6. **Negotiate with the research testing center:** Reach out to the testing center and explain your situation. They might be willing to provide some advance payment or assistance with travel expenses to help you get started.\n7. **Look for local opportunities:** Search for local job postings, especially part-time or temporary positions, that can help you cover the travel expenses.

    "base_reply": "I can understand why you're upset! Dealing with a professional who doesn't meet their commitments can be frustrating and disappointing, especially when it comes to something as important as your wedding photos.\n\nBefore we dive into the \"justice\" aspect, let's take a step back and assess the situation. Have you already spoken to the photographer about the issues with their performance? Have you given them a chance to apologize, explain themselves, and make things right?\n\nIt's essential to approach this situation calmly and professionally. Sending angry or aggressive messages can escalate the situation and make it harder to resolve. Instead, try to have a constructive conversation with the photographer, focusing on the specific issues you've experienced. Be specific about the problems you've faced, such as their late arrival and the condition of the photos.\n\nIf the photographer has already apologized and made amends, or if you're not satisfied with their response, here are some next steps you can take:\n\n1. Review your contract: Check your contract to see if there are any clauses that address late arrival or subpar work. If there are, you may have a solid basis for a claim or negotiation.\n2. Document everything: Keep a record of all communication with the photographer, including dates, times, and details of the issues you've faced. This will help you build a strong case if you need to escalate the matter.\n3. Seek mediation: Consider hiring a mediator or seeking help from a consumer protection agency to help resolve the issue. They can provide guidance on your options and help you navigate the process.\n4. Leave a review: If the photographer is a small business or freelancer, leaving a review on their social media page or review platforms can help others make informed decisions about working with them in the future.\n5. Move forward: While it's essential to address the issue, don't let it consume your time and energy. Focus on moving forward and finding ways to celebrate your special day despite the challenges.\n\nRemember, seeking justice doesn't always mean getting revenge or causing harm to the other party. Sometimes, it's about finding a resolution that respects both parties and prioritizes fairness and respect.\n\nHow do you feel about taking these steps? Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or any concerns you have about the situation?"

Finally he can see all the unseen work I do looking after our son, dog and house and we can split it more evenly (I also work).\n\nBut now, this past week he hasn’t done half his tasks. He comes to me saying oh we haven’t had sex this weekend and we need to follow this. Look, I’m all for scheduling sex as unsexy as it is because we have a toddler BUT a big reason we’ve been fighting is because I’m so exhausted from doing all the unseen child rearing, housework and working at the same time, so to be quite Frank I don’t feel like sex at the end of the day. If he had of done his tasks I’d probably be less exhausted and more keen.\n\nI don’t know what I’m asking here but is it bad I’m not following my end of the bargain if he didn’t fulfill his? He can’t have his cake and eat it too. I need advice on how to handle this. I have communicated this and he got pissed off and went for a nap.\n\nTl:dr husband made chores checklist but seems to only expect me to follow it.",
    "human": "Scheduling sex is one thing, but trying to use a chore chart to coerce someone into sex is gross on a number of levels. For one thing, consent still matters. And it's a strange choice to class sex as a chore- I only want to have sex with someone who wants to have sex with me, not someone who sees it like cleaning the toilet.\n\nIt's totally reasonable that you don't feel romantic when he's not pulling his weight. I would sit down and revisit the chore list. If he DID do everything on his list do you think it would be balanced? If not, talk about the work he's not taking into account. And then talk about how you two can actually complete your chores consistently.\n\nAnd then, I would agree with him that regular intimacy is important, but it's something you want both of you to enjoy, and you don't think it should be classed as a chore.",
    "base_reply": "I totally get it. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and exhausted, and rightfully so. It's not fair to expect you to carry the load of childcare, household responsibilities, and work, and then still be expected to be available for sex and other shared activities without some reciprocation.\n\nFirstly, it's not bad at all that you're not following your end of the bargain if he's not holding up his end. In fact, it's reasonable to expect some flexibility and understanding when one partner isn't meeting their commitments.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1. Have a calm and honest conversation: When your husband wakes up from his nap, try to have a calm and rational conversation with him. Explain how you're feeling and how his lack of following the chore schedule is impacting you. Avoid blaming or attacking language, and focus on your own feelings and needs.\n2. Reframe the expectations: Instead of focusing on the checklist, try to reframe the expectations around shared responsibilities. You could say something like, \"I understand we made a plan to share the workload, but I'm feeling really overwhelmed and exhausted. Can we revisit the plan and find a way to make it more balanced and sustainable for both of us?\"\n3. Set clear boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries around your own energy and availability. You can say something like, \"I'm not feeling up for sex tonight because I'm exhausted. Can we reschedule for another time when I'm feeling more refreshed?\" or \"I need some time to recharge, can we have a break from date nights for a little while?\"\n4. Practice empathy and understanding: Try to understand where your husband is coming from and why he might not be following the schedule. Is he stressed or overwhelmed too? Is there something going on that's making it difficult for him to keep up his end? Practice empathy and understanding, but don't let that excuse his lack of effort.\n5. Re-evaluate the checklist: If your husband is consistently not following the schedule, it might be time to re-evaluate the checklist and see if it's still working for both of you. Maybe there are some tasks that can be adjusted or delegated differently.\n\nRemember, relationships are about compromise and mutual understanding. You're not asking for the moon, you're asking for a fair and balanced partnership."

You can express your gratitude for the opportunity to be part of the event, but explain your situation and let your boss know that you can't afford to work for free. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hi [Boss], I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this event, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. However, as you know, I'm a casual employee, and I rely on my income to support my family. Working for free on this night would be a significant financial burden for me. I'm willing to discuss alternative arrangements, such as taking on additional shifts leading up to the event or helping with setup or cleanup, but I won't be able to work for free. I hope you understand my situation.\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Your boss might not like it, but it's a reasonable request.

For example, \"I feel hurt and confused when you do something that you previously told me is a deal-breaker for you, while not giving me the same freedom.\"\n2. Evaluate the relationship: Ask yourself if you're willing to continue in a relationship where she's not willing to hold herself to the same standards she sets for you. Consider whether you're comfortable with the power imbalance that's developing.\n3. Prioritize your own needs: If you need some space to process your emotions, it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own well-being.

You can have an honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and see if you can work together to find a solution.\n5. Consider the bike event: If you're still willing to attend the bike event with her dad and her, that's okay. It's a way to maintain some connection and show that you're willing to put in effort. However, make sure you're not ignoring the elephant in the room and that you're not compromising your own values.\n\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and communication.

However, it's also important to consider your partner's boundaries and comfort level. It seems like your date is indicating that she's not ready to open up emotionally yet, and that's okay. It's not uncommon for people to take time to build trust and feel comfortable sharing their feelings.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to consider whether you're being too intense or overwhelming. It's possible that your date is feeling like she's being put on the spot or pressured to reciprocate your emotions, which can be uncomfortable. You might want to try to find a balance between expressing yourself and respecting her boundaries.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of stopping sharing your emotions entirely, try to find ways to communicate them in a more subtle or low-key way. For example, instead of saying \"I feel really upset when you ended the call abruptly,\" you could say \"I felt a bit thrown off when we ended the call so suddenly. Can we find a way to wrap things up more smoothly next time?\" This way, you're still expressing your feelings, but in a more nuanced and less intense way.\n\nIt's also important to have an open and honest conversation with your date about your concerns and feelings. You could say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed that you've mentioned a few times that you're not ready for a relationship, and I want to respect that. However, I do want to share my feelings with you and be open with you. Is there a way we can find a balance between my emotional expression and your comfort level?

Recognize that these feelings are normal, but not insurmountable.\n\nHere are some strategies to help you break the cycle:\n\n1. **Set a budget and track your spending**: Make a conscious decision to allocate a specific amount for League of Legends expenses each month.

Out of sight, out of mind!\n3. **Focus on in-game rewards**: Instead of buying skins, focus on earning them through gameplay. This will help you feel more accomplished and connected to the game without breaking the bank.\n4. **Find alternative hobbies**: Explore other interests and hobbies that bring you joy, which can help distract you from the allure of new skins. This will also help you develop a more balanced lifestyle.\n5. **Practice delayed gratification**: When you see a new skin you want, wait 24 hours before making a purchase. This will help you assess whether the urge is genuine or just a impulsive desire.\n6. **Consider a \"skin-free\" period**: Take a break from buying skins for a set period, like 3-6 months. This will help you reset your spending habits and re-evaluate your priorities.\n7. **Seek accountability**: Share your struggles with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. Having someone to report to can be a great motivator.\n8. **Focus on the game's core experience**: Remember that the core gameplay of League of Legends is what brought you joy initially. Focus on improving your skills, playing with friends, and enjoying the game's competitive aspects, rather than just chasing skins.\n\nRemember, breaking a habit takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.

Even though I realize this, it is difficult to notice when I am in the conversation.  I am just wondering if there are any exercises or tips to keep myself on check next time.",

    "base_reply": "Recognizing the tendency to dominate conversations is a great step towards self-awareness! It's common to get caught up in the moment and lose track of the balance. Here are some tips and exercises to help you stay mindful and avoid talking too much:\n\n1. **Practice active listening**: Make a conscious effort to focus on the other person's words, tone, and body language. Repeat back what you've understood to ensure you're on the same page. This will help you stay present and avoid interrupting or dominating the conversation.\n2. **Set a mental timer**: Give yourself a mental reminder to speak for a certain amount of time (e.g., 2-3 minutes) before allowing yourself to respond. This can help you stay concise and prevent lengthy monologues.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage the other person to share more. This will help shift the focus away from yourself and create opportunities for others to contribute.\n4. **Use the 70/30 rule**: Aim to listen 70% of the time and speak 30%. This will help you maintain a healthy balance and ensure you're not overwhelming others with your own thoughts.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Take a few deep breaths before responding to a question or comment. This brief pause can help you gather your thoughts, reflect on what's being said, and respond more thoughtfully.\n6. **Notice your body language**: Pay attention to your nonverbal cues. Are you leaning forward, making eye contact, and nodding? These subtle signs can indicate you're engaged and interested in the conversation, which can help you stay present and avoid dominating.\n7. **Ask for feedback**: Share your concerns with a trusted friend or family member and ask them to gently point out when you're dominating a conversation. This can help you become more aware of your tendencies and make adjustments.\n8. **Practice self-reflection**: Schedule regular time for self-reflection, whether daily, weekly, or monthly. Reflect on your conversations, acknowledging both your successes and areas for improvement. This will help you develop a greater sense of self-awareness and make adjustments over time.\n\nRemember, becoming more mindful and self-aware takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. With consistent effort, you'll become more attuned to your conversation habits and develop healthier communication patterns."

    "sentence": "I wrote here a few days ago, but the post got deleted – presumably because it didn't contain a clearly defined question. This is a newly formatted one with updates and more precise questions about the situation at the end. Which means it's also quite long.\n\nMe and my girlfriend have been together for bit over a year. The relationship started perhaps a bit too soon after my previous relationship had ended. In that relationship, I suffered mental and physical violence for many years. One of the most damaging aspects of it was that I was often blackmailed into having sex, \"proving\" to the other person she was desirable, or else I was in danger of getting physically assaulted or not allowed to sleep. I've been in therapy for quite some time now but in some ways I'm still coming to terms with the trauma and learning to call it what it was.\n\nSo far, the relationship with my current partner has been good, healthy and mutually supportive. She's been a good friend and a partner who has made me feel loved for who I am.\n\nI've struggled with not being sure about my feelings from time to time, but I've tried to see it through the lens of having a bad model for relationship stuck inside me and getting freaked out when things are suddenly nice and there's no fear involved.\n\nMy girlfriend is bipolar and doesn't handle alcohol well at all. There have been times when I've been disturbed by how my girlfriend becomes erratic when drunk. She doesn't drink that often, but when she does, she almost always does it to the point of almost turning into a different person who can be pretty heavy to deal with; very commanding to the people around her, sometimes ends up doing risky stuff (walking home from the other side of the city in -30C etc.). She has in her past kicked a bad cocaine addiction. Currently, she's dealing with some incredibly stressful stuff in her personal life. Moreover, two months ago she decided to stop taking her meds (SSRIs) cold turkey, with no supervision from her doctors.\n\nLast weekend, a get-together at my place involving my girlfriend, one of her friends and one of my friends turned into a horrible experience. She got super drunk, began asking significant amounts of money from my friend to fund a project of hers, which understandably made the friend feel very awkward. Soon after, she was so wasted that she could only sit on the shower floor and throw up. We tried our best to assist and comfort her with her friend.\n\nAfter the guests had left, I managed to help my girlfriend to bed. She was crying, going through a wide array of different states in a flash, her speech such that it was difficult to understand what she was trying to say. She began asking if we could have sex. I replied that we should do it tomorrow when we're both sober. This made her angry, and she started repeating: \"what's wrong with me? You need to tell me now.\" I told her that there was absolutely nothing wrong with her but that this simply wasn't a good time for sex because she was wasted. She kept insisting that we talk about what I think is wrong with her. I told her we can talk about anything tomorrow but that right now is not a good time. I asked if I could go to sleep. She told me: \"no, we're talking about this right now!\" When I insisted, thing started getting out of hand. She started walking loudly around the apartment, opening the drawers and began throwing clothes on the floor, presumably to pack her stuff while cursing and telling me to go fuck myself.\n\nAt this point, I was not only triggered and frightened, but also worried that since I'd never seen her like this, this might at worst be a beginning of some kind of psychotic state caused by the combination of alcohol and quitting the meds. Her potentially heading outside in this state by herself did not seem like a good idea either, so I called her friend who, upon leaving, had given me her number and asked to call if my girlfriend needs any further assistance. The said friend is also my girlfriend's flatmate and they live pretty close by.\n\nThe friend arrived, tried to calm my girlfriend down under the blanket as I went to sit on the sofa. My girlfriend, crying uncontrollably, was telling my friend that her friend is now a witness and can \"prove what really happened\", that she did not throw any stuff on the floor. She said this as the piles of clothes were still lying on the floor. Also, knowing I was in close proximity and listening, she also said all kinds of insults about me: that I'm emotionless, comparing me to the ex of her friend who just cheated on her and saying that she (my girlfriend) regrets spending a year of her life in our relationship. Also, most hurtful of all, she said that she now no longer believes my stories about my ex abusing me.\n\nFinally, after two hours of this, and me continuously asking if they could leave together to her place (she kept saying \"I'm staying here, I'm not leaving\", I grew increasingly worried about the neighbours calling the police or something) she packed all her stuff, including her cat. She sat down next to me repeatedly during this process, telling me over and over again that I need to call my psychologist right now (don't know how I would do that in the middle of the night). She told me that I was overreacting and that she is so disappointed in me. She also said that I'm really sick, and what happened before was normal in arguments and that my reaction was the reason it had gone overboard. She kept telling me to calm down as I was sitting there in silence. I told her I thought it was still a good idea for her to go to her place with her friend and that I felt she was gaslighting me. Finally, they left with all the stuff with them and my girlfriend left her keys on the table, telling me to do all future communication via her friend. I told her that I did not mean this to become a process of breaking up at night and that the reason for me calling her friend was that I was both worried and knew I couldn't handle the situation by myself.\n\nI was shocked at how fast a relationship that so far has seemed very healthy could become like this overnight, after such a long time of no signs of anything like this. It also feels very damaging because it took me back to where I was a few years ago and also broke my trust I had built over the course of this new relationship.\n\nThe next day, I reserved an emergency meeting with my therapist, discussed what happened with a friend and texted my girlfriend's friend to ask her to make sure she seemed mentally stable because I was still worried all this might be related to the meds. Her friend told me that it didn't seem like she was detached from reality. That same evening, my girlfriend texted me. I was disappointed to see that instead of apologising or attempting to explain her behaviour, she continued to focus on me, saying that \"I know you think I acted strange, but I think you acted strange too\". I decided to take some time to get over the initial shock and didn't reply. At this point, I had pretty much made my mind up about ending the relationship: whatever was going on with her, this did not seem like a healthy place for me to be.\n\nToday, she texted me again. She told me that she was sorry how she behaved and what effect it had on me, that she's been suffering because of what happened but doesn't want to make it about her, only wants to apologise and that I should only talk with her when I'm ready.\n\nI still can't bring myself to reply to her. I feel paralysed, and can't do much of anything except sit at home in sadness and anxiety, flipping the channels on TV and type this.\n\nI'm so torn over this situation.\n\nMy questions are: should I talk to her about anything other than ending the relationship? Does the situation warrant another chance or am I just falling back to my old ways?\n\nI know it's easy for me to get stuck in a loop where it's really hard for me to let go of someone I care about, even when things are obviously not working. I'm also easily manipulated into forgiving even the most horrible behaviour, and scared that I'm again moving towards that state of mind. On the other hand, she did apologise (even though it took a while) and this is the first time this has happened.\n\nThanks for reading. And thanks for your thoughts in advance.\n\nTL; DR My girlfriend got drunk, behaved in a threatening and insulting way that triggered my trauma and tried to gaslight me afterwards. Now she's apologising – does it make sense to give the relationship another chance?",
    "human": "&gt;My questions are: should I talk to her about anything other than ending the relationship? Does the situation warrant another chance or am I just falling back to my old ways?\n\nI'd think about it less in terms of if what she did was \"bad enough\" to not give her another chance, and more in terms of whether or not you feel you can handle and want to give her another chance. \n\nThere is a chance it really was her med withdrawal and alcohol that led to the blow up, and that she will learn from this experience and not do that again. But it sounds like this is a pattern of behavior and this incident was just particularly bad, so there's also a chance that she will continue to struggle with med compliance and substances for some time, as most people can't just make huge changes to things like that overnight.\n\nDating someone with significant mental illness can be tough. If both people have significant mental health concerns, such as your trauma + her bipolar, that's even tougher. Bipolar is not something that ever goes away, meds help manage it but do not \"cure\" it, and even on meds people can have manic or depressive episodes (which can then also lead to them going off meds and exacerbate the problem). If you choose to date someone with that disability, you'd need to understand that and be prepared for accommodating that. It can be done, some people can separate themselves enough to not take a partner's mental illness personally and support them through it without damaging their own mental health, but it doesn't sound like you're there right now given that your own trauma is being triggered. \n\nSo it really doesn't matter how apologetic she is or how bad the incident was. What matters is do you feel like you can handle this moving forward while maintaining your own mental stability? If the answer is no, you should end the relationship. It doesn't have to be her fault or your fault, it can be based on knowing that neither of you are stable enough for a healthy relationship with each other",
    "base_reply": "Wow, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling torn and anxious about what to do next.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that your girlfriend's behavior is unacceptable and harmful. Her actions are a red flag, and it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and safety above any desire to save the relationship.\n\nConsidering her apology, it's good that she acknowledged her behavior was wrong and apologized. However, the fact that she didn't take responsibility for her actions, blaming you for overreacting, and downplaying the severity of what happened is concerning. It's also problematic that she tried to gaslight you, making you question your own experiences and feelings.\n\nGiven your history with trauma and manipulation, it's crucial to prioritize your own healing and not rush into forgiving or giving her another chance without proper consideration. You've already taken significant steps by recognizing the unhealthy patterns and seeking help. Now, it's essential to focus on your own needs and boundaries.\n\nBefore making a decision, I recommend taking some time to reflect on the following:\n\n1. What are your non-negotiables in a relationship? What are your deal-breakers?\n2. Have you communicated your boundaries and needs clearly with your girlfriend, and have they been respected?\n3. Are there any signs of progress or change in her behavior, or is this an isolated incident?\n4. How do you feel about your own emotional safety and well-being in the relationship?\n\nRemember, you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for your feelings or decisions. Your priority should be your own healing and growth.\n\nIf you do decide to have a conversation with your girlfriend, it's essential to approach it calmly and assertively, focusing on your own feelings and needs. You can express your concerns and boundaries without blaming or attacking her. However, it's crucial to be prepared for the possibility that she may not be willing to work on herself or change her behavior.\n\nUltimately, it's okay to prioritize your own healing and take the time you need to figure out what's best for you. Remember that you deserve a healthy, loving, and respectful relationship where you feel safe and valued.\n\nTake your time, and don't rush into anything that doesn't feel right. You've got this, and you're stronger than you think."
