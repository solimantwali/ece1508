    "prompt": "How to be happy with yourself Just to add, I'm not a person who lacks self-confidence, but as of recently I haven't been happy with myself. I find myself lacking drive and determination to do anything. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you",
    "sft_response": "I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'd recommend looking into mindfulness. It's a simple concept that is more or less just being present in the moment and accepting it. \n\nThe first step is to recognize when you're thinking about the past or future. When you catch yourself thinking about something that has already happened or something that hasn't happened yet, acknowledge that it's just a thought and let it go. \n\nThe second step is to accept what is happening. I know that sounds simple, but it's hard. It's hard because we tend to want things to be different than they are. We want to be in a different place, or with different people, or we want things to be different than they are. \n\nWhen you find yourself thinking about something that you wish was different, acknowledge that it's a thought and let it go. Then accept that things are the way they are, and focus on the present moment. \n\nI know this sounds simple, but it's hard. I've been doing this for months now, and I still catch myself thinking about the past or future. It's a process, and it's not easy, but it's worth it. \n\nI hope this helps!

    "ppo_response": "I'm glad you're seeking help and recognizing that you're not satisfied with your current state. Being unhappy with oneself can be a challenging and isolating experience. I'm here to offer some guidance that might help you cultivate a more positive relationship with yourself.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's normal to experience fluctuations in motivation and self-perception. Life can be unpredictable, and it's common to feel stuck or uninspired at times. Recognize that this is a temporary state, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person.\n\nTo increase your sense of self-acceptance and happiness, I recommend the following strategies:\n\n1. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, just as you would with a close friend. Acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n2. **Identify and challenge negative self-talk**: Pay attention to your inner dialogue. Notice when you're criticizing or putting yourself down. Challenge those thoughts by reframing them in a more balanced and realistic light. For example, instead of \"I'm such a failure,\" say \"I'm having a tough time right now, but I can learn from this"

    "prompt": "TLDR: athiests: would you date someone who believes in god? If so what boundaries would you have especially regarding coparenting? I am an atheist and want to ask other athiests: would you date someone who believes in god? Why or why not? If yes, would you have any boundaries on what is taught to your kids? (Assuming you want them) For context I (29) went on a date with someone (33) and really clicked with them. It was just one date but they seem very connected (although not preachy or dogmatic) about their religion. I've never dated someone who believes in god, and don't want my kids growing up religious. Wondering if it's worth even trying to continue or if I should just give up now.",
    "sft_response": "I think that\u2019s a wonderful question. I\u2019m an agnostic and I\u2019ve dated a Christian. My ex would go to church every Sunday and would bring me to church and I would go with him. I never felt pressured to go or to convert. I never felt like he was trying to make me into something I wasn\u2019t. I would always ask him questions about his faith and he would tell me everything and I would ask him questions and he would answer them. I really enjoyed that he was so open and honest about his faith. It made me respect it more.\n\nI also appreciated that he wasn\u2019t preachy about it and he didn\u2019t make me feel like I was bad for not being religious. I also appreciated that he would pray for me when I was sick. I\u2019m not really a person who goes to the doctor or takes care of myself, so when I was sick, he would pray for me and would tell me that he believed that God was healing me. It made me feel better and it made me feel loved and it made me feel protected.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to raise my kids religious, but I would let him pray for them. I would let him take them to church and I would let him tell them about God. I would tell him",
    "ppo_response": "I'll provide a nuanced and honest perspective from an atheist's point of view.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're considering the values and beliefs of your potential partner, especially when it comes to raising children. It's essential to be open and honest about your concerns and boundaries.\n\nAs an atheist, you might be worried about the following aspects:\n\n1. Religious influence on your children: You might be concerned about your partner's beliefs potentially shaping your kids' worldview and values.\n2. Different parenting styles: Your partner's religious beliefs might lead to different parenting approaches, which could cause conflicts or difficulties in decision-making.\n3. Social and cultural differences: Your partner's religious beliefs might lead to differences in social and cultural practices, which could create tension or challenges in your relationship.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the following points:\n\n1. Compatibility and compromise: You've already had a great connection with your partner, and it's possible to find common ground and compromise on your differences.\n2. Open-mindedness: If your partner is not dogmatic or preachy, they might be open to understanding and respecting your atheist views.\n3. Co-parenting: You can work together to create a balanced and inclusive environment for your children, incorporating both your values and beliefs."

    "prompt": "How to stop being an emotional abuser My marriage is on the verge of ending, and I know it's my fault. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression after hitting my husband in a fit of rage. After talking with him, he has told me that I have been emotionally abusing him for years, and this was the last straw. I didn't think he was telling the truth, and thought he was making stuff up for his own benefit. Then I looked up signs of emotional abuse. I've been doing a majority of them for years. Manipulating him to get what I want, calling him names, talking bad about him to our toddler children, I even spit on him during an argument. Anyway, I need to know how to stop this. I honestly thought what I was doing was a normal thing in relationships. Now that my eyes have been opened to that, I'm a wreck. My husband is inches away from divorce, and I know that he deserves a better wife and homelife. How do I stop? Especially since I didn't know I was doing it. Please help!",
    "sft_response": "My ex used to do that to me. I had to be in therapy for a long time before I was able to stop. I would suggest you do the same. I also recommend you read the book \"The Gift of Fear\". It's about abuse, and it will help you understand what's going on. You are a victim of abuse, and you deserve help. My ex was an abusive narcissist and I was a narcissist myself. We both were in the same abusive relationship and it was toxic. I don't know what kind of marriage you have but I suggest you get out. You deserve to be loved, and you deserve to be treated with respect. \n\nI was in a very abusive relationship. My ex cheated on me, manipulated me, and I was the only one who worked. I was the only one who did the dishes, cooked, cleaned, etc. He was an abusive narcissist and I was an abused narcissist. I was a narcissist because I was so in love with him and I wanted him to love me. He was my everything and I was his. We were in a toxic relationship. I had to get therapy to stop the abuse.
